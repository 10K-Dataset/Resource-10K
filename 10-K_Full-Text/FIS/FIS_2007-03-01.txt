PART I

Item 1.

Business.

General
    Development of the Business

FIS constitutes one of the largest global providers of
    processing services to financial institutions, with
    market-leading positions in core processing, card issuing
    services, check risk management, mortgage processing, and lender
    processing services in the U.S. We serve customers in over
    60 countries throughout the world. We offer a diversified
    product mix, and we believe that we will continue to benefit
    from the opportunity to cross-sell products and services across
    our broad customer base, and from our expanded international
    presence and scale.

Our business operations and organizational structure result from
    the February 1, 2006, business combination of Certegy and
    Former FIS (the Certegy Merger), pursuant to which Former FIS
    was merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Certegy.
    Immediately after the Certegy Merger, the stockholders of Former
    FIS, including its then-majority stockholder Old FNF owned
    approximately 67.4% of our outstanding common stock.
    Accordingly, for accounting and financial reporting purposes,
    the Certegy Merger was treated as a reverse acquisition of
    Certegy by Former FIS under the purchase method of accounting
    pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
    and a tax free merger under IRC§368(a). Also, as a result
    of the Certegy Merger, our name changed from “Certegy
    Inc.” to “Fidelity National Information Services,
    Inc.” and our New York Stock Exchange trading symbol from
    “CEY” to “FIS”. Our board of directors was
    reconstituted so that a majority of the board now consists of
    directors designated by the stockholders of Former FIS. On
    November 9, 2006, Old FNF (after other transactions in
    which it distributed all of its assets other than its ownership
    in FIS) merged with and into FIS (the FNF Merger). Upon
    completion of the FNF Merger, FIS became an independent publicly
    traded company, and Old FNF ceased to exist as an independent
    publicly traded company. The assets distributed by Old FNF prior
    to the FNF Merger included its ownership in Fidelity National
    Title Group, Inc., which following the FNF Merger renamed
    itself Fidelity National Financial, Inc.

Certegy was incorporated on March 2, 2001, under the laws
    of the State of Georgia as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Equifax
    Inc. (Equifax). Equifax contributed its payment services
    division to Certegy and “spun off” Certegy on
    July 7, 2001, through a tax-free dividend of all of
    Certegy’s outstanding shares of common stock to
    Equifax’s shareholders. As a result of the spin-off,
    Certegy became an independent publicly traded company. Certegy
    established itself as a leading provider of card issuer services
    to community financial institutions and as a leading provider of
    check risk management services to large national retailers.
    During the past decade, the company expanded its card and check
    operations internationally to serve customers in over 25
    countries. Also during that time, the company broadened its
    domestic product lines to include eBanking services to financial
    institutions and cash access services to the gaming industry.

Former FIS was incorporated under the laws of the State of
    Delaware on May 20, 2004, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Old FNF, our former parent company. From November 2004 through
    March 2005, Old FNF contributed a number of business entities to
    Former FIS, including certain real estate-related information
    services and loan default management businesses developed by Old
    FNF in the 1990s, and a series of over 25 acquisitions completed
    by Old FNF between 2001 and 2005. Although many of these
    acquisitions added important applications


and services to the offerings of Former FIS, the recent growth
    of Former FIS has been driven primarily by the acquisitions of
    companies that provide core processing services to financial
    institutions including:

•

The financial services division of ALLTEL Information Services,
    Inc., a provider of core banking and mortgage processing
    services;

•

Aurum Technology, a provider of software and outsourcing
    solutions to community banks and credit unions;

•

Kordoba, a provider of information technology solutions for the
    financial services industry with a focus on services and
    solutions for the German banking market;

•

Sanchez Computer Associates, Inc., or Sanchez, a provider of
    software and outsourcing solutions to banks and other financial
    institutions; and

•

InterCept, Inc., or InterCept, a provider of outsourced and
    in-house core banking solutions, as well as item processing and
    check imaging services.

Financial
    Information About Operating Segments and Geographic
    Areas

Shortly after the February 1, 2006 merger of Certegy and
    FIS, we implemented a new organizational structure and we began
    reporting under a new operating segment structure effective with
    first quarter 2006 results. The new reportable segments are
    Transaction Processing Services, or TPS, and Lender Processing
    Services, or LPS. This reporting structure is consistent with
    the management and the operating structure adopted following the
    Certegy Merger. The primary components of the TPS segment are
    Integrated Financial Solutions, Enterprise Banking Solutions,
    and International. The TPS segment includes Certegy’s
    former Card and Check Services segments and the financial
    institution processing component of the Financial Institution
    Software and Services segment of Former FIS. The primary
    components of the Lender Processing, or LPS segment, are
    Mortgage Processing Services, which includes the Mortgage
    Processing component of the Financial Institution Software and
    Services segment of Former FIS, and Information Services, which
    includes the Lender Services, Default Management, and
    Information Services segments of Former FIS.

Revenues in our Transaction Processing, or TPS, segment are
    generated predominantly from the development, implementation,
    management, support and maintenance of core processing software
    and systems used by financial institutions to maintain the
    primary records of their customer accounts. We also provide a
    comprehensive range of credit card processing and cardholder
    support services to our financial institution customers.
    Additionally, revenues in this segment are generated by
    providing check risk management services to large national and
    regional retail chains. Our Integrated Financial Solutions
    customers are comprised primarily of community banks, credit
    unions and savings banks based in the U.S., while our Enterprise
    Banking Solutions customers are comprised of large and mid-tier
    financial institutions and retailers in the U.S. Our
    International customer base consists primarily of large and
    mid-tier financial institutions and retailers outside of North
    America.

Revenues in our Lender Processing, or LPS, segment are generated
    from products and services that span the entire mortgage loan
    life cycle, from origination through closing, refinancing,
    default, foreclosure and resale. Included among these services
    are property appraisal and valuation services, property records
    information, real estate tax services, borrower credit and flood
    zone information and certification, and mortgage processing and
    default management services. Also included are loan facilitation
    services, consisting of centralized, customized title agency,
    and closing services, that allow financial institutions to
    outsource their title and loan closing requirements in
    accordance with pre-selected criteria, regardless of the
    geographic location of the borrower or property. We provide
    these services to U.S. based mortgage lenders, mortgage
    servicers, investors and real estate professionals to assist
    them in the completion of real estate transactions.

Narrative
    Description of the Business

Overview

FIS provides a comprehensive range of core processing services,
    check services, card issuer and transaction processing services,
    risk management services, mortgage loan processing,
    mortgage-related information products, and outsourcing services
    to a wide variety of financial institutions, retailers, mortgage
    lenders and mortgage loan

    more than 60 countries worldwide, and have processing and
    technology relationships with 35 of the top 50 global banks,
    including nine of the top ten. Approximately 50 percent of
    all U.S. residential mortgages are processed using our

The customers cited in the following discussion provide a
    representative cross-section of our customers based on size,
    geographic location, type of institution and the services that
    they use.

Our
    Transaction Processing Services Operating Segment

Integrated
    Financial Solutions

The primary focus of our Integrated Financial Solutions business
    is to serve the processing needs of independent community banks,
    credit unions, and savings banks in the United States.
    Processing solutions include core processing, branch automation,
    back office support systems, compliance, credit and debit card
    issuing, image item processing, print and mail, ATM/EFT, retail
    internet banking and bill payment services, commercial cash
    management and voice response services. Over 8,000 commercial
    banks, savings institutions and credit unions utilize one or
    more of these solutions.

Of these 8,000 institutions, over 1,200 institutions utilize one
    of our core processing solutions. Customers of this segment
    typically seek a fully integrated and broad suite of
    applications. As a result, our core processing services sold in
    this market have various add-on modules or applications that
    integrate into our core processing applications, providing a
    broad processing solution. Examples of our customers in this
    sector include Hudson City Savings Bank, Sterling Bank, and
    VyStar Credit Union.

Over 6,000 institutions utilize our card issuer services which
    enable banks, credit unions, and others to issue VISA and
    MasterCard credit and debit cards, and other electronic payment
    cards for use by both consumer and business accounts. The
    majority of our card issuer programs are full service, including
    most of the operations and support necessary for an issuer to
    operate a credit and debit card program. We do not make credit
    decisions for our card issuing customers, nor do we fund their
    card receivables. We provide our card issuer services primarily
    through our longstanding contractual alliances with two
    associations representing independent community banks and credit
    unions in the U.S., the Independent Community Bankers of
    America, or ICBA, and Card Services for Credit Unions, or CSCU.
    These organizations offer our products and services to their
    respective members with our company as the provider. Our
    alliances with the ICBA and CSCU provide us with an efficient
    and effective means of marketing our products and services to
    individual credit unions and community banks.

Our item processing and imaging services are utilized by more
    than 1,100 institutions. The services provide our customers with
    a wide range of outsourcing services relating to the imaging and
    processing of checks, statements, remittances, and other
    transaction records, which are performed at one of our 52
    processing centers located throughout the U.S. or

on-site

at a
    customer location.

We provide a full range of eBanking capabilities, including
    electronic funds transfer, or EFT, processing solutions, ranging
    from automated teller machine, or ATM, and debit card services
    to card production and distribution to stored-value gift cards
    and payroll cards. Our eBanking services are utilized by more
    than 850 financial institutions and enable them to offer
    Internet banking and bill payment services to consumers and
    businesses.

Enterprise
    Banking Solutions

Our Enterprise Banking Solutions division focuses on serving the
    processing needs of large U.S. financial institutions,
    automotive financing companies, and commercial lenders. We also
    provide check risk management and related processing products
    and services to businesses accepting or cashing checks at the

point-of-sale,

and provide comprehensive cash access services in the gaming
    industry. Primary service offerings include:

    and commercial banking requirements necessary for all aspects of

    and credit risk, and allow automotive finance institutions to
    manage their loan and lease portfolios.

•

Check Risk Management Services for
    Retailers.

Our check risk management services
    utilize our proprietary risk management services and data

The processing needs of our customers vary significantly across
    the sizes and types of entities we serve. These entities include:

•

Large Financial Institutions.

We define the
    large financial institution market as banks and other financial
    institutions in North America with assets in excess of
    $5 billion. Of the 100 largest U.S. banks as of
    December 31, 2006, our customers included 15 banks that use
    our real-time, integrated loan and deposit applications, 41
    banks that use our deposit-related core processing applications,
    36 banks that use our lending-related core processing
    applications and 32 banks that use our various retail delivery
    applications. Our customers in this market include JP Morgan
    Chase, Bank of America, ING/Direct, Charles Schwab Bank, and
    Citizens Bank of Rhode Island.

•

Automotive Finance Institutions.

Our
    automotive finance processing services include integrated loan
    and lease servicing solutions for the global automotive finance

    loans and leases in North America and Europe were processed on
    our automotive finance applications. We also offer origination,

e-contract

hosting, dealer wholesale finance, and other ancillary services,
    providing an

end-to-end

automotive finance solution. Three of the top five captive
    automotive finance companies in the U.S., as ranked at the end
    of 2005, utilize our applications and services.

•

Commercial Lenders.

We also provide business
    solutions that allow clients to automate and manage their entire

    JP Morgan Chase, Barclays Capital, Bank of Scotland, and
    Rabobank.

•

Retailers.

A significant portion of our
    revenues from check risk management services is generated from
    large national retail chains including Sears, Best Buy, Marmaxx
    and Albertson’s. Other customers of our check risk
    management products and services include regional merchants such
    as hotels, automotive dealers, telecommunication companies,
    supermarkets, gaming establishments, mail order houses and other
    businesses.



We have developed several models of providing our customers with
    applications and services. We typically deliver the highest
    value to our customers when we combine our software applications
    and deliver them in one of several types of outsourcing
    arrangements, such as an application service provider,
    facilities management processing or application management
    arrangement. We are also able to deliver individual applications
    through a software licensing arrangement. Finally, using our
    expertise gained in the foregoing types of arrangements, we also
    have clients for whom we manage their IT operations, without
    providing any of our proprietary software.

International

We offer core banking applications, item processing, card
    services, and check risk management solutions to financial
    institutions, card issuers, and retailers in approximately 60
    countries outside the United States. Our international operation
    leverages existing domestic applications and provides services
    for the specific business needs of our customers in targeted
    international markets. Our service offering includes a
    comprehensive range of full-service outsourced solutions,
    including core banking applications and transaction processing
    and call center services. We also provide application
    management, facilities management, consulting services, and

Our
    Lender Processing Services Operating Segment

Mortgage
    Processing Services

We offer the most widely used mortgage loan servicing system
    (known as MSP) in the U.S. As of December 31, 2006,
    our mortgage loan servicing platforms, including MSP, were used
    to process over 50% of all residential mortgages by dollar
    volume in the U.S. representing balances exceeding $4.0
    trillion. Our mortgage loan processing customers include Bank of
    America, Wells Fargo, National City Mortgage, and U.S. Bank
    Home Mortgage. Our customer relationships are typically
    long-term relationships that generally provide relatively
    consistent annual revenues based on the number of mortgages
    processed on our platform.

While our mortgage servicing applications can be purchased on a
    stand-alone, licensed basis, the substantial majority of our MSP
    customers by both number of customers and loan volume choose to
    use us as their processing partner and engage us to perform all
    data processing functions in our technology center located in
    Jacksonville, Florida. Customers determine whether to process
    their loan portfolio data under an application service provider
    arrangement in which multiple clients share the same computing
    and personnel resources or to have their own dedicated resources
    within our facility.

The primary applications and services of this business include:

•

MSP.

Our Mortgage Servicing Platform, or MSP,
    automates all areas of loan servicing, including loan setup and
    ongoing processing, customer service, accounting and reporting
    to the secondary mortgage market, and federal regulatory
    reporting. MSP processes a wide range of loan products,
    including fixed-rate mortgages, adjustable-rate mortgages,
    construction loans, equity lines of credit, and daily simple
    interest loans.

•

Empower!

Empower! is a mortgage loan
    origination software system used by banks, savings &
    loans, mortgage bankers, and

sub-prime

lenders. This application fully automates every phase of making
    loans, providing seamless credit bureau access and interfacing
    with automated underwriting systems used by Freddie Mac and
    Fannie Mae, as well as with vendors providing servicing, flood
    certifications, appraisals, and title insurance.

Mortgage
    Information Services

We offer a comprehensive suite of services spanning the entire
    mortgage loan life cycle, from loan origination through closing,
    refinancing, foreclosure and resale. A significant number of our
    customers use a combination of our mortgage information,
    mortgage origination and default management services. Our client
    base includes mortgage lenders such as ABN Amro,
    U.S. Bancorp, Bank of America, Freddie Mac, New Century
    Mortgage and



Washington Mutual, as well as investors and real estate
    professionals. Our primary product lines are described below:

•

Valuation and Appraisal Services.

We provide a
    broad suite of valuation applications, which include automated
    valuation models, traditional appraisals, broker price opinions,
    collateral scores, and appraisal reviews. We have developed
    innovative new hybrid valuation offerings such as collateral
    valuation insurance, which combine a traditional valuation with
    an insurance policy issued by an unaffiliated third party that
    guarantees the accuracy of a valuation within certain parameters.

•

Real Estate Tax Services.

We offer lenders a
    monitoring service that will notify them of any change in tax
    status during the life of a loan. We also provide complete
    outsourcing of tax escrow services, including the establishment
    of a tax escrow account that is integrated with the
    lender’s mortgage servicing system and the processing of
    tax payments to taxing authorities.

•

Flood Zone Certifications.

We offer flood zone
    certifications through a proprietary automated system that
    accesses and interprets Federal Emergency Management Agency, or
    FEMA, flood maps and certifies whether a property is in a
    federally designated flood zone. Additionally, we offer lenders
    a

life-of-loan

flood zone determination service that monitors previously issued
    certificates for any changes, such as FEMA flood map revisions,
    for as long as that loan is outstanding.

•

1031 Exchange Intermediary Services.

We act as
    a qualified exchange intermediary for those customers who seek
    to engage in qualified exchanges under Section 1031 of the
    Internal Revenue Code, which allows capital gains tax deferral
    on the sale of certain real estate investment assets.

•

Mortgage Origination Services.

We provide
    centralized title and closing services to financial institutions
    in the first mortgage, refinance, home equity and

sub-prime

lending markets. Our client base includes Wells Fargo,
    Washington Mutual, and Bank of America. Our centralized
    financial institution title agency services include arranging
    for the issuance of a title insurance policy by a title insurer.
    We offer these services on a national basis, both in the
    traditional manner and through our centralized production
    facilities that incorporate automated processes, which can help
    expedite the delivery of services. Our closing management
    services cover a variety of types of closings, including
    purchases and refinancings, and provide a variety of types of
    services. We maintain a network of independent closing agents
    who are trained to close loans in accordance with the
    lender’s instructions.

•

Credit Reporting.

We provide credit
    information reports and related services to meet the needs of
    the mortgage industry and help commercial banks, mortgage
    companies, and consumer lenders make loan decisions. Our
    services include providing a merged credit report that contains
    credit history data on individual or joint credit applicants
    acquired from the combined databases of three credit bureaus
    (Experian, Trans Union and Equifax) for national coverage. We
    consolidate and organize information from these credit bureaus
    and deliver a concise report to our customers.

•

Default Management Services.

We primarily
    provide our default management services to national mortgage
    lenders and loan servicers, many of which previously performed
    this function in-house. We currently provide default management
    services to 22 of the top 25 residential mortgage servicers, 13
    of the top 25

sub-prime

servicers, and 24 of the top 25 subservicers. Washington Mutual
    and Bank of America are two of our largest customers. Our
    Default Management Services enable mortgage lenders and loan
    servicers to outsource the business processes necessary to take
    a loan and the underlying real estate securing the loan through
    the default and foreclosure process. We work with customers to
    identify specific parameters regarding the type and quality of
    services they require and provide a single point of contact for
    these services. As a result, our customers are able to use our
    outsourcing services in a manner that we believe provides a
    greater level of consistency in services, pricing, and quality
    than if these customers were to obtain these services from
    separate providers. For example, we can offer default management
    services to our MSP mortgage processing customers. We use our
    own resources and networks that we have established with
    independent contractors to provide these default management
    outsourcing solutions.



Sales and
    Marketing

Sales
    Force

Our sales and marketing efforts are primarily organized around
    our lines of business, and by customer market segment and
    distribution channel. In our Transaction Processing Services
    segment, we have a sales force that markets our core processing
    services to our large national bank customers. A separate sales
    group focuses on community based institutions. Specialized sales
    teams have been established to promote our products to national
    and regional retailers and the automotive and gaming industries.
    In addition, we have a sales force responsible for marketing our
    services outside the United States. We also market certain
    products and services of our Transaction Processing Services
    segment through indirect sales channels, such as ICBA and CSCU,
    independent sales organizations, marketing alliances, and
    financial institutions.

In our Lender Processing Segment, sales teams are assigned to
    national banks, credit unions, thrifts, and mortgage companies
    based on institution size. Other teams focus on more highly
    specialized lending and servicing companies. We endeavor to
    increase market share by attracting new customers as well as
    further penetrating our customer base by selling additional
    mortgage related product services including origination, default
    management, tax and appraisal services, to existing mortgage
    processing clients and vice versa.

A significant portion of our potential customers in each of our
    business lines is targeted via direct

and/or

indirect field sales, as well as inbound and outbound
    telemarketing efforts. Marketing activities include direct
    marketing, print advertising, media relations, public relations,
    tradeshow and convention activities, seminars, and other
    targeted activities. As many of our customers use a single
    product or service, or a combination of products or services,
    our direct sales force also targets existing customers to
    promote cross-selling opportunities. Our strategy is to use the
    most efficient delivery system available to successfully acquire
    customers and build awareness of our products and services.

In addition to our traditional sales force, we have established
    a core team of senior managers to lead strategic account
    management for the full range of our services to existing and
    potential top-tier financial institution customers. The
    individuals who participate in this effort, which we coordinate
    through our Office of the Enterprise, spend a significant amount
    of their time on sales and marketing efforts as well as working
    with our business units to develop solutions based upon
    strategic issues impacting customers’ businesses.

Patents,
    Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal
    security practices, and copyright and trade secret law to
    establish and protect our software, technology, and expertise.
    Further, we have developed a number of brands that have
    accumulated substantial goodwill in the marketplace, and we rely
    on trademark law to protect our rights in that area. We intend
    to continue our policy of taking all measures we deem necessary
    to protect our copyright, trade secret, and trademark rights.
    These legal protections and arrangements afford only limited
    protection of our proprietary rights, and there is no assurance
    that our competitors will not independently develop or license
    products, services, or capabilities that are substantially
    equivalent or superior to ours. In general, we believe that we
    own most proprietary rights necessary for the conduct of our
    business, although we do license certain items, none of which is
    material, under arms-length agreements for varying terms.

Competition

In the large bank sector, the markets for our core banking
    products and services are highly competitive. The markets are
    very mature and have a number of existing providers with a high
    level of experience and significant market share. Additionally,
    given the attractive market characteristics in financial
    services, there are from time to time new market entrants which
    seek to leverage shifts in technology or product innovation to
    attract customers.

Our primary competitors include internal technology departments
    within banks, data processing or software development
    departments of large companies or large computer manufacturers,
    third-party payment processors, independent computer services
    firms, companies that develop and deploy software applications,
    companies that provide customized development, implementation
    and support services, and companies that market software for the
    electronic payment industry. Some of these competitors possess
    substantially greater financial, sales and marketing



resources than we do. Competitive factors for applications and
    services include the quality of the technology-based application
    or service, application features and functions, ease of delivery
    and integration, ability of the provider to maintain, enhance,
    and support the applications or services, and price. We believe
    that we compete favorably in each of these categories. In
    addition, we believe that our financial institution industry
    expertise, combined with our ability to offer multiple
    applications and services to individual customers, enhances our
    competitiveness against competitors with more limited
    application offerings.

We compete with vendors that offer similar core processing
    applications and services to financial institutions, including
    Fiserv, Inc., Jack Henry and Associates, Inc., Metavante
    Corporation, Open Solutions, IBM and Accenture. In certain

non-U.S. markets,

we compete with regional providers including Alnova, I-Flex, and
    Temenos.

Our competitors in the card issuer services market include
    third-party credit and debit card processors such as First Data
    Corporation, Total System Services, Electronic Data Systems
    Corporation, and Payment Systems for Credit Unions, and
    third-party software providers, which license their card
    processing systems to financial institutions and third-party
    processors. Competitors in the check risk management services
    market include First Data’s TeleCheck Services division,
    CrossCheck, eFunds, and Global Payments.

The markets for our mortgage information services are also
    highly competitive. Key competitive factors include quality of
    the service, convenience, speed of delivery, customer service,
    and price. We do not believe that there is a competitor
    currently offering the scope of services and market coverage
    that we provide in our mortgage information services business.
    However, there are a number of competitors in specific lines,
    some of which have substantial resources. First American and
    Land America are significant competitors in a majority of our
    Mortgage Information Services, including tax, flood, appraisal
    and default.

Research
    and Development

Our research and development activities have related primarily
    to the design and development of our processing systems and
    related software applications and risk management platforms. We
    expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate
    level of resources to maintain, enhance and extend the
    functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software
    applications, to develop new and innovative software
    applications and systems in response to the needs of our
    customers, and to enhance the capabilities surrounding our
    outsourcing infrastructure. In addition, we intend to offer
    products and services that are compatible with new and emerging
    delivery channels.

As part of our research and development process, we evaluate
    current and emerging technology for applicability to our
    existing and future software platforms. To this end, we engage
    with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of
    various infrastructure components. Where appropriate, we use
    third-party technology components in the development of our
    software applications and service offerings. Third-party
    software may be used for highly specialized business functions,
    which we may not be able to develop internally within time and
    budget constraints. Additionally, third-party software may be
    used for commodity type functions within a technology platform
    environment. In the case of nearly all of our third-party
    software, enterprise license agreements exist for the
    third-party component and either alternative suppliers exist or
    transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply. As a
    result, we are not materially dependent upon any third-party
    technology components. We work with our customers to determine
    the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or
    infrastructure changes to our applications and services. In the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 we recorded
    expense of approximately $105.6 million,
    $113.5 million and $74.2 million, respectively on
    research and development efforts.

With respect to our outsourcing of software development, we are
    transferring costs from our U.S. and Western European-based
    development centers to Covansys Corporation (Covansys), in which
    FIS holds an equity investment, and other lower cost off-shore
    facilities. We are using our relationship with Covansys and with
    other facilities to lower our internal development costs over
    time by outsourcing certain programming, development and
    maintenance functions.



Government
    Regulation

Various aspects of our businesses are subject to federal, state,
    and foreign regulation. Our failure to comply with any
    applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on
    our ability to provide our products and services, as well as the
    imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties.

As a provider of electronic data processing and back-office
    services to financial institutions such as banks, thrifts and
    credit unions we are subject to regulatory oversight and
    examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination
    Council, an interagency body of the Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Office of the
    Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the
    Federal Reserve System, the National Credit Union Administration
    and various state regulatory authorities. In addition,
    independent auditors annually review several of our operations
    to provide reports on internal controls for our customers’
    auditors and regulators. We also may be subject to possible
    review by state agencies that regulate banks in each state in
    which we conduct our electronic processing activities.

Beginning July 1, 2001, financial institutions were
    required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the
    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These regulations place restrictions on
    financial institutions’ use of non-public personal
    information. All financial institutions must disclose detailed
    privacy policies to their customers and offer them the
    opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share
    information with third parties. The new regulations, however,
    permit financial institutions to share information with
    non-affiliated parties who perform services for the financial
    institutions. As a provider of services to financial
    institutions, we are required to comply with the privacy
    regulations and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure
    of the information received from our customers as apply to the
    financial institutions themselves.

Given that one of the databases that we maintain in the
    U.S. contains certain data pertaining to the check-writing
    histories of consumers, and that data is used to provide certain
    check risk management services, our check risk management
    business is subject to the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and
    various similar state laws. Among other things, the Fair Credit
    Reporting Act imposes requirements on us concerning data
    accuracy, and provides that consumers have the right to know the
    contents of their check-writing histories, to dispute their
    accuracy, and to require verification or removal of disputed
    information. In furtherance of our objectives of data accuracy,
    fair treatment of consumers, protection of consumers’
    personal information, and compliance with these laws, we
    maintain a high level of security for our computer systems in
    which consumer data resides, and we maintain consumer relations
    call centers to facilitate efficient handling of consumer
    requests for information and handling of disputes.

Our check collection services are subject to the Federal Fair
    Debt Collection Practices Act and various state collection laws
    and licensing requirements. The Federal Trade Commission, as
    well as state attorneys general and other agencies, have
    enforcement responsibility over the collection laws, as well as
    the various credit reporting laws.

Elements of our cash access business are registered as a Money
    Services Business and are subject to the USA Patriot Act and
    reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and
    U.S. Treasury Regulations. This business is also subject to
    various state, local and tribal licensing requirements. The
    Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, state attorneys general,
    and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws
    relating to money laundering, currency transmission, and
    licensing.

The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or RESPA, and related
    regulations generally prohibit the payment or receipt of fees or
    any other item of value for the referral of a real
    estate-secured loan to a loan broker or lender and prohibit fee
    shares or splits or unearned fees in connection with the
    provision of residential real estate settlement services, such
    as mortgage brokerage and real estate brokerage. Notwithstanding
    these prohibitions, RESPA permits payments for goods furnished
    or for services actually performed, so long as those payments
    bear a reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods
    or services provided. RESPA and related regulations may to some
    extent restrict our real estate-related businesses from entering
    into certain preferred alliance arrangements. The
    U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is
    responsible for enforcing RESPA.

Real estate appraisers are subject to regulation in most states,
    and some state appraisal boards have sought to prohibit our
    automated valuation applications. Courts have limited such
    prohibitions, in part on the ground of



preemption by the federal Financial Institutions Reform,
    Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, but we cannot assure you
    that our valuation and appraisal services business will not be
    subject to regulation.

The title agency and related services we provide are conducted
    through an underwritten title company, title agencies, and
    individual escrow officers. The regulation of an underwritten
    title company in California is generally limited to requirements
    to maintain specified levels of net worth and working capital,
    and to obtain and maintain a license in each of the counties in
    California in which it operates. The title agencies and
    individual escrow officers are also subject to regulation by the
    insurance or banking regulators in many jurisdictions. These
    regulators generally require, among other items, that agents and
    individuals obtain and maintain a license and be appointed by a
    title insurer. We also own a small title insurer which issues
    policies generated by our agency operations in relatively
    limited circumstances. This insurer is domiciled in New York and
    is therefore subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory
    authorities of that state. Among other things, no person may
    acquire 10% or more of our common stock without the approval of
    the New York insurance regulators.

The California Department of Insurance has recently proposed
    implementing rate reductions in the title insurance industry in
    California. New York, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, Texas and other
    insurance regulators have also announced reviews of title
    insurance rates and other states could follow. At this stage, we
    are unable to predict what the outcome will be of these or any
    similar processes.

Given that we conduct business in international markets as well
    as in the U.S., we are subject to laws and regulations in
    jurisdictions outside the U.S. that regulate many of the
    same activities that are described above, including electronic
    data processing and back-office services for financial
    institutions and use of consumer information.

The IRS has proposed regulations under Section 468B
    regarding the taxation of the income earned on escrow accounts,
    trusts and other funds used during deferred exchanges of
    like-kind property and under Section 7872 regarding
    below-market loans to facilitators of these exchanges. The
    proposed regulations affect taxpayers that engage in like-kind
    exchanges and escrow holders, trustees, qualified
    intermediaries, and others that hold funds during like-kind
    exchanges. We currently do not know what effect these changes
    will have on our 1031 exchange businesses.

Although we do not believe that compliance with future laws and
    regulations related to our businesses, including future consumer
    protection laws and regulations, will have a material adverse
    effect on our company, enactment of new laws and regulations may
    increasingly affect the operations of our business, directly or
    indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory
    compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity,

and/or

loss
    of revenue.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 24,871
    employees, including approximately 7,706 employees principally
    employed outside of the U.S. None of our
    U.S. workforce currently is unionized. We have not
    experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations
    with employees to be good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

In addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to
    significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed
    below and others described elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Any of the risks described herein could result in a significant
    adverse effect on our results of operation and financial
    condition.

If we
    fail to adapt our services to changes in technology or in the
    marketplace, or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology
    are not successful, we could lose customers and have difficulty
    attracting new customers for our products and
    services.

The markets for our services are characterized by constant
    technological changes, frequent introductions of new services
    and evolving industry standards. Our future success will be
    significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current
    products and services, and develop and introduce new products
    and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs
    of our customers and their clients. These initiatives carry the
    risks associated with any new product or service development
    effort, including cost overruns, delays in delivery, and
    performance issues. There can be no assurance that we will be
    successful in developing, marketing and selling new products and
    services that meet these changing demands, that we will not
    experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the
    successful development, introduction, and marketing of these
    products and services, or that our new products and services and
    their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the
    marketplace and achieve market acceptance.

We
    operate in a competitive business environment, and if we are
    unable to compete effectively our results of operations and
    financial condition may be adversely affected.

The market for our services is intensely competitive. Our
    competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the
    services they offer. Some of our competitors have substantial
    resources. We face direct competition from third parties, and
    since many of our larger potential customers have historically
    developed their key applications in-house and therefore view
    their system requirements from a make-versus-buy perspective, we
    often compete against our potential customers’ in-house
    capacities. In addition, we expect that the markets in which we
    compete will continue to attract new competitors and new
    technologies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
    compete successfully against current or future competitors or
    that competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we
    operate will not materially adversely affect our business,
    financial condition, and results of operations.

Our
    substantial leverage and debt service requirements may adversely
    affect our financial and operational flexibility.

As of December 31, 2006, we had total debt of approximately
    $3.0 billion. This high level of debt could have important
    consequences to us, including the following:

•

the debt level makes us more vulnerable to economic downturns
    and adverse developments in our business, may cause us to have
    difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital,
    capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes and will
    limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities and
    implement certain business strategies;

•

we need to use a large portion of the money we earn to pay
    principal and interest on our senior credit facilities, which
    reduces the amount of money available to finance operations,
    acquisitions and other business activities, repay other
    indebtedness and pay shareholder dividends;

•

some of the debt has a variable rate of interest, which exposes
    us to the risk of increased interest rates; and

•

we have a higher level of debt than certain of our competitors,
    which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce
    flexibility in responding to changing business and economic
    conditions, including increased competition.

In addition, the terms of our senior credit facilities may
    restrict us from taking actions, such as making significant
    acquisitions or dispositions or entering into certain agreements
    that we might believe to be advantageous to us.



If we
    are unable to successfully consummate and integrate
    acquisitions, our results of operations may be adversely
    affected.

As part of our growth strategy, we have made numerous
    acquisitions in recent years. We anticipate that we will
    continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses, products
    and services. This strategy will depend on the ability to find
    suitable acquisitions and finance them on acceptable terms. We
    may require additional debt or equity financing for future
    acquisitions, and doing so will be made more difficult by our
    substantial debt. If we are unable to acquire suitable
    acquisition candidates, we may experience slower growth.

Further, even if we successfully complete acquisitions, we will
    face challenges in integrating any acquired business. These
    challenges include eliminating redundant operations, facilities
    and systems, coordinating management and personnel, retaining
    key employees, managing different corporate cultures, and
    achieving cost reductions and cross-selling opportunities. There
    can be no assurance that we will be able to fully integrate all
    aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the
    potential benefits of bringing them together, and the process of
    integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and
    divert our resources.

Consolidation
    in the banking and financial services industry could adversely
    affect our revenues by

eliminating some of our existing and potential customers and
    could make us more dependent on a more limited number of
    customers.

There has been and continues to be substantial merger,
    acquisition and consolidation activity in the banking and
    financial services industry. Mergers or consolidations of banks
    and financial institutions in the future could reduce the number
    of our customers and potential customers, which could adversely
    affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the
    aggregate number of customers or the banking and other
    activities of the consolidated entities. If our customers merge
    with or are acquired by other entities that are not our
    customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may
    discontinue or reduce their use of our services. In addition, it
    is possible that the larger banks or financial institutions
    resulting from mergers or consolidations could decide to perform
    in-house some or all of the services which we currently provide
    or could provide. Any of these developments could have a
    material adverse effect on our business and results of
    operations.

Demand
    for many of our products and services is sensitive to the level
    of consumer transactions

generated by our customers, and accordingly, our revenues could
    be impacted negatively by a general economic slowdown or any
    other event causing a material slowing of consumer
    spending.

A significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction
    processing fees. Any changes in economic factors that adversely
    affect consumer spending and related consumer debt, or a
    reduction in check writing or credit and debit card usage, could
    reduce the volume of transactions that we process, and have an
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

Potential
    customers of our financial information software and services
    business may be reluctant to switch to a new vendor, which may
    adversely affect our growth, both in the U.S. and
    internationally.

For banks and other potential customers of our financial
    information software and services segment, switching from one
    vendor of bank core processing or related software and services
    (or from an internally-developed system) to a new vendor is a
    significant undertaking. Many potential customers worry about
    potential disadvantages such as loss of accustomed
    functionality, increased costs and business disruption. As a
    result, potential customers, both in the U.S. and
    internationally, often resist change. We seek to overcome this
    resistance through strategies such as making investments to
    enhance the functionality of our software. However, there can be
    no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential
    customers’ reluctance to change vendors will be successful,
    and this resistance may adversely affect our growth, both in the
    U.S. and internationally.

Decreased
    lending and real estate activity may reduce demand for certain
    of our services and adversely affect our results of
    operations.

Revenues from our information services and lender services
    operations are closely related to the general level of real
    estate transactions, such as real estate sales and mortgage
    refinancings. Real estate sales are affected by a



number of factors, including mortgage interest rates, the
    availability of funds to finance purchases and general economic
    conditions. The volume of refinancing transactions in particular
    and mortgage originations in general declined in 2004, 2005 and
    2006 from 2003 levels, resulting in reduction of revenues in
    some of our businesses. In addition, rising mortgage delinquency
    and default rates have negatively impacted some of our mortgage
    lending customers, particularly within the subprime lending
    market. These trends appear likely to continue. Our revenues in
    future periods will continue to be subject to these and other
    factors which are beyond our control and, as a result, are
    likely to fluctuate.

We
    could have conflicts with FNF, and the executive chairman of our
    board of directors and other

officers and directors could have conflicts of interest due to
    their relationships with FNF.

Conflicts may arise between FNF and us as a result of our
    ongoing agreements and the nature of our respective businesses.
    Among other things, we and certain of our subsidiaries are
    parties to a variety of intercompany agreements with FNF.
    Certain of our executive officers and directors will be subject
    to conflicts of interest with respect to such intercompany
    agreements and other matters due to their relationships with FNF.

Some of the FNF executive officers and directors who became
    executive officers and directors of our company in connection
    with the FNF Merger, including William P. Foley, II, Alan
    L. Stinson and Brent B. Bickett, own substantial amounts of FNF
    stock and stock options because of their relationships with FNF
    and Old FNF prior to the FNF Merger. Such ownership could create
    or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when our
    directors and officers are faced with decisions that involve FNF
    or any of its respective subsidiaries.

Mr. Foley, who became our Executive Chairman in connection
    with the FNF Merger, is currently the Chief Executive Officer
    and Chairman of the board of directors of FNF. Mr. Stinson
    and Mr. Bickett also became officers of our company and
    FNF. As a result, each of these individuals has obligations to
    us as well as to FNF and will have conflicts of interest with
    respect to matters potentially or actually involving or
    affecting us and FNF.

Matters that could give rise to conflicts between us and FNF
    include, among other things.

•

our past and ongoing relationships with FNF, including
    intercompany agreements and other arrangements with respect to
    the administration of tax matters, employee benefits,
    indemnification, and other matters;

•

the quality and pricing of services that we have agreed to
    provide to FNF or that it has agreed to provide to us; and

•

business opportunities arising for either us or FNF, that could
    be pursued by either us or by FNF.

We will seek to manage these potential conflicts through dispute
    resolution and other provisions of our agreements with FNF and
    through oversight by independent members of our board of
    directors. However, there can be no assurance that such measures
    will be effective or that we will be able to resolve all
    potential conflicts with FNF, or that the resolution of any such
    conflicts will be no less favorable to us than if we were
    dealing with an unaffiliated third party.

We may
    lack adequate oversight since the chairman of the board of
    directors and chief executive officer of FNF is also our
    executive chairman.

Mr. Foley is executive chairman of our board of directors.
    Mr. Foley is also the chairman of the board of directors
    and chief executive officer of FNF. As a result of his roles, he
    has obligations to us as well as FNF and may have conflicts of
    time with respect to matters potentially or actually involving
    or affecting us. As executive chairman, it is expected that
    Mr. Foley will devote no more than one-half of his time to
    matters relating to us. If Mr. Foley’s duties as
    executive chairman of our board of directors require more time
    than he is able to allot, then his oversight of the activities
    of our company could be diminished and the effective management
    of our company could be adversely affected.



Our
    revenues from the sale of services to VISA and MasterCard
    organizations are dependent upon our continued VISA and
    MasterCard certification and financial institution sponsorship,
    and the loss or

suspension of this certification or sponsorship could adversely
    affect our business.

In order to provide our card services, we must be designated a
    certified processor by, and be a member service provider of,
    MasterCard and be designated as an independent sales
    organization of VISA. These designations are dependent upon our
    continuing adherence to the standards of the VISA and MasterCard
    associations. The member financial institutions of VISA and
    MasterCard, some of which are our competitors, set the standards
    with which we must comply. If we fail to comply with these
    standards, our designation as a certified processor, as a member
    service provider, or as an independent sales organization could
    be suspended or terminated. The termination of our member
    service provider status or our status as a certified processor,
    or any changes in the VISA and MasterCard rules that prevent our
    registration or otherwise limit our ability to provide
    transaction processing and marketing services for the VISA or
    MasterCard organizations would result in the loss of business
    from VISA or MasterCard issuing customers, and lead to a
    reduction in our revenues, which would have a material adverse
    effect on our business.

We
    have a long sales cycle for many of our applications and if we
    fail to close sales after expending

significant time and resources to do so, our business, financial
    condition, and results of operations may be adversely
    affected.

The implementation of many of our applications often involves
    significant capital commitments by our customers, particularly
    those with smaller operational scale. Potential customers
    generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of
    available software and require us to expend substantial time,
    effort, and money educating them as to the value of our software
    and services. We incur substantial costs in order to obtain each
    new customer. We may expend significant funds and management
    resources during the sales cycle and ultimately fail to close
    the sale. Our sales cycle may be extended due to our
    customers’ budgetary constraints or for other reasons. If
    we are unsuccessful in closing sales after expending significant
    funds and management resources or we experience delays, it could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition, and results of operations.

If Old
    FNF’s 2006 spin-off of FNF does not constitute a tax free
    distribution under Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue
    Code or if our merger with Old FNF does not constitute a tax
    free reorganization under Section 368(a), then we may suffer
    losses resulting from payment of taxes and tax-related
    losses.

Under a tax disaffiliation agreement, which we were required to
    enter into with Old FNF and FNF as a condition to the closing
    under our merger agreement with Old FNF, FNF is required to
    indemnify us for taxes and tax-related losses (including
    stockholder suits) if Old FNF’s 2006 spin-off of FNF (the
    “2006 Distribution”) were determined to be taxable
    either to Old FNF (and us as its successor) or the FNF
    stockholders or both, unless such adverse determination were the
    result of a breach by us of our agreement not to take any action
    within our control that would cause the 2006 Distribution to be
    taxable or the result of an acquisition of FIS stock within the
    control of us or a subsidiary. In such an event, Old FNF
    estimated that the amount of tax on the transfer of FNF’s
    stock in the distribution could be in the range of
    $150 million and possibly greater depending on, among other
    things, the value of FNF’s stock at the time of the 2006
    Distribution. In addition, FNF is required under the tax
    disaffiliation agreement to indemnify Old FNF (and us as its
    successor) for taxes and tax-related losses (including
    stockholder suits) in the event the Old FNF-FIS merger were
    determined to be taxable. Old FNF estimated that the amount of
    tax on Old FNF’s transfer and retirement of its FIS stock
    in the merger could be in the range of $1 billion and
    possibly greater depending on, among other things, the value of
    our stock at the time of the merger.

Even if the 2006 Distribution otherwise qualifies as a spin-off
    under Section 355 of the Code, the distribution of FNF
    common stock to the Old FNF stockholders in connection with the
    2006 Distribution would not qualify as tax-free to Old FNF (or
    us as its successor) under Section 355(e) of the Code if
    50% or more of the stock of Old FNF (including us as successor
    to Old FNF) or FNF is acquired as part of a plan or series of
    related transactions that includes the 2006 Distribution. As a
    result of our merger with Old FNF, approximately 49% of our
    stock would be treated as having been acquired pursuant to a
    plan that includes the 2006 Distribution for purposes of
    Section 355(e) of the Code.



There is no guaranty that FNF will have financial resources to
    satisfy any such indemnification obligation described above. If
    the tax-free status is lost because of any action taken by us or
    any of our subsidiaries after the time of the 2006 Distribution
    (except for certain actions specifically identified in the tax
    disaffiliation agreement), we would be required to pay the taxes
    described above ourself and would be required to indemnify FNF
    for all tax-related losses.

We may
    be affected by significant restrictions following the FNF Merger
    with respect to certain actions that could jeopardize the
    tax-free status of the spin-off by Old FNF of Fidelity National
    Title Group or the FNF Merger.

In order to preserve the tax-free treatment of the spin-off by
    Old FNF of Fidelity National Title Group, a tax disaffiliation
    agreement entered into by FNF and us prior to the closing under
    the FNF Merger agreement restricts us, for two years after the
    spin-off, from taking certain actions within our control that
    could cause the spin-off to be taxable without first obtaining a
    consent of certain officers of FNF or obtaining an opinion from
    a nationally recognized law firm or accounting firm that such
    action will not cause the spin-off to be taxable to FNF under
    Section 355(e) of the Code. In general, such actions would
    include engaging in certain transactions involving (i) the
    acquisition of our stock or (ii) the issuance of shares of
    our stock.

Because of these restrictions, we may be limited in the amount
    of stock that we can issue to make acquisitions or raise
    additional capital in the two years subsequent to the spin-off
    and the FNF Merger and in our ability to repurchase shares of
    our common stock.

We may
    experience software defects, development delays, and
    installation difficulties, which would harm our business and
    reputation and expose us to potential liability.

Many of our services are based on sophisticated software and
    computing systems, and we may encounter delays when developing
    new applications and services. Further, the software underlying
    our services has occasionally contained and may in the future
    contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or
    when new versions are released. In addition, we may experience
    difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on
    platforms used by our customers. Defects in our software,
    errors, or delays in the processing of electronic transactions,
    or other difficulties could result in:

•

interruption of business operations;

•

delay in market acceptance;

•

additional development and remediation costs;

•

diversion of technical and other resources;

•

loss of customers;

•

negative publicity; or

•

exposure to liability claims.

Although we attempt to limit our potential liability through
    disclaimers and

limitation-of-liability

provisions in our license and customer agreements, we cannot be
    certain that these measures will be successful in limiting our
    liability.

Security
    breaches or computer viruses could harm our business by
    disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our
    reputation.

As part of our business, we electronically receive, process,
    store, and transmit sensitive business information of our
    customers. In addition, we collect personal consumer data, such
    as names and addresses, social security numbers, driver’s
    license numbers, checking and savings account numbers, and
    payment history records. Unauthorized access to our computer
    systems or databases could result in the theft or publication of
    confidential information or the deletion or modification of
    records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our
    operations. These concerns about security are increased when we
    transmit information over the Internet. Computer viruses have



also been distributed and have rapidly spread over the Internet.
    Computer viruses could infiltrate our systems, disrupting our
    delivery of services and making our applications unavailable.
    Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses
    could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our
    systems and terminate their agreements with us, and could
    inhibit our ability to attract new customers.

Many
    of our customers are subject to a regulatory environment and to
    industry standards that may change in a manner that reduces the
    number of transactions in which our customers engage and

therefore reduces our revenues.

Our customers are subject to a number of government regulations
    and industry standards with which our products and services must
    comply. For example, our products are affected by VISA and
    MasterCard electronic payment standards that are generally
    updated twice annually. In addition, action by regulatory
    authorities relating to credit availability, data usage,
    privacy, or other related regulatory developments could have an
    adverse effect on our customers and therefore could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
    and results of operations.

If we
    fail to comply with privacy regulations imposed on providers of
    services to financial institutions, our business could be
    harmed.

As a provider of services to financial institutions, we are
    bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information
    we receive from our customers as apply to the financial
    institutions themselves. If we fail to comply with these
    regulations, we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract
    or to governmental proceedings, our customer relationships and
    reputation could be harmed, and we could be inhibited in our
    ability to obtain new customers. In addition, if more
    restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted in the future on
    the federal or state level, or, with respect to our
    international operations, by authorities in foreign
    jurisdictions on the national, provincial, state, or other
    level, that could have an adverse impact on us.

If we
    experience system failures, the products and services we provide
    to our customers could be delayed or interrupted, which could
    harm our business and reputation and result in the loss of
    customers.

Our ability to provide reliable service in a number of our
    businesses depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operations
    of our computer network systems and data centers. Our systems
    and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from
    fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure,
    unauthorized entry, and computer viruses. Although we have taken
    steps to prevent system failures, we cannot be certain that our
    measures will be successful. Further, our property and business
    interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for
    all losses or failures that may occur. Any significant
    interruptions could:

•

increase our operating expenses to correct problems caused by
    the interruption;

•

harm our business and reputation;

•

result in a loss of customers; or

•

expose us to liability.

Any one or more of the foregoing occurrences could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
    and results of operations

We
    face liability to our merchant customers if checks that we have
    guaranteed are dishonored by the check writer’s
    bank.

If a check that we have guaranteed is dishonored by the check
    writer’s bank, we must reimburse our merchant customer for
    the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount
    from the delinquent check writer. In some cases, we recognize a
    liability to our merchant customers for estimated check returns
    and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from
    the check writers, based on historical experience and other
    relevant factors. The estimated check returns and recovery
    amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may
    exceed our estimates and actual amounts recovered may be less
    than our estimates.



Our
    outsourcing of key development functions overseas may lead to
    quality control issues that affect our business
    operations.

By outsourcing development functions overseas, we may experience
    quality control issues in our applications offered to our
    markets. Overseas outsourcing operations are subject to risk of
    quality control deficiencies due to the physical distance from
    our headquarters, the increased potential for instructions and
    guidance to be misunderstood, a lack of direct institutional
    control and the time and expense it will take to provide on site
    training. Any one of these factors make it more difficult for us
    to maintain quality control, and the potential for quality
    control issues may impact our ability to maintain and or
    increase our customer base.

Misappropriation
    of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair
    our competitive position.

Our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and
    technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary
    rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our
    services or to obtain and use information that we regard as
    proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights
    is difficult. We cannot make any assurances that the steps we
    have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology or that
    the agreements entered into for that purpose will be
    enforceable. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright, and
    trade secret protection may not be available in every country in
    which our applications and services are made available online.
    Misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential
    litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

If our
    applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary
    rights of others, we may be required to change our business
    practices and may also become subject to significant costs and
    monetary penalties.

As our information technology applications and services develop,
    we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims. Any
    claims, whether with or without merit, could:

•

be expensive and time-consuming to defend;

•

cause us to cease making, licensing or using applications that
    incorporate the challenged intellectual property;

•

require us to redesign our applications, if feasible;

•

divert management’s attention and resources; and

•

require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in
    order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies.

We may
    not succeed with our current and future expansion of our
    international operations and such

failure may adversely affect our growth and results of
    operations.

In 2006, sales outside of the U.S. represented
    approximately 10.9% of our revenues. We believe there are
    additional opportunities to expand our international operations,
    and we expect to commit significant resources to expand our
    international sales and marketing activities. However, overall
    we are less well-known internationally than in the United States
    and have less experience with local business conditions. In
    addition, we will face challenges in successfully managing small
    operations located far from our headquarters, because of the
    greater difficulty in overseeing and guiding operations from a
    distance, and we will be increasingly subject to a number of
    other risks and potential costs, including:

•

political and economic instability;

•

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and policy, the
    adoption of laws detrimental to our operations such as
    legislation relating to the collection of personal data over the
    Internet or the adoption of laws, regulations, or treaties
    governing the export of encryption related software;

•

the burdens of complying with a wide variety of other laws and
    regulations;



•

failure to adequately manage currency exchange rate fluctuations;

•

potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on
    the repatriation of earnings;

•

potential difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting
    receivables in some foreign legal systems; and

•

general economic conditions in international markets.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete
    successfully against current or future international competitors.

Sales
    of our shares by large shareholders could adversely affect the
    trading price of our shares.

In connection with the 2005 minority interest sale in Former
    FIS, we entered into a registration rights agreement with
    certain of our stockholders requiring us to register the shares
    of our common stock that are beneficially owned by them.
    Consequently, we have to date registered for resale from time to
    time shares which collectively account for approximately 12.8%
    of our shares outstanding. Sales of these shares, or the
    possibility that sales of these shares may occur in unlimited
    amounts and without prior notice, could adversely affect the
    trading price of our shares.

Statement
    Regarding Forward-Looking Information

The statements contained in this

Form 10-K

or in our other documents or in oral presentations or other
    statements made by our management that are not purely historical
    are forward-looking statements within the meaning of
    Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
    including statements regarding our expectations, hopes,
    intentions, or strategies regarding the future. These statements
    relate to, among other things, our future financial and
    operating results. In many cases, you can identify
    forward-looking statements by terminology such as
    “may,” “will,” “should,”
    “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,”
    “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,”
    “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative
    of these terms and other comparable terminology. Actual results
    could differ materially from those anticipated in these
    statements as a result of a number of factors, including, but
    not limited to:

•

general political, economic, and business conditions, including
    the possibility of intensified international hostilities, acts
    of terrorism, and general volatility in the capital markets;

•

failures to adapt our services to changes in technology or in
    the marketplace;

•

consolidation in the mortgage lending or banking industry;

•

security breaches of our systems and computer viruses affecting
    our software;

•

a decrease in the volume of real estate transactions such as
    real estate sales and mortgage refinancings, which can be caused
    by high or increasing interest rates, a shortage of mortgage
    funding, or a weak United States economy;

•

the impact of competitive products and pricing;

•

the ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates and the
    ability to finance such acquisitions, which depends upon the
    availability of adequate cash reserves from operations or of
    acceptable financing terms and the variability of our stock
    price;

•

our ability to integrate any acquired business’ operations,
    products, clients, and personnel;

•

the effect of our substantial leverage, which may limit the
    funds available to make acquisitions and invest in our business;

•

changes in, or the failure to comply with, government
    regulations, including privacy regulations; and

•

other risks detailed elsewhere in this Risk Factors section and
    in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.



We are not under any obligation (and expressly disclaim any such
    obligation) to update or alter our forward-looking statements,
    whether as a result of new information, future events or
    otherwise. You should carefully consider the possibility that
    actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking
    statements.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings.

In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various
    pending and threatened litigation matters related to our
    operations, some of which include claims for punitive or
    exemplary damages. We believe that no actions, other than the
    matters listed below, depart from customary litigation
    incidental to our business. As background to the disclosure
    below, please note the following:

•

These matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal
    issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities.

•

We review these matters on an on-going basis and follows the
    provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 5, “Accounting for
    Contingencies,” when making accrual and disclosure
    decisions. When assessing reasonably possible and probable
    outcomes, we base our decision on our assessment of the ultimate
    outcome following all appeals.

The Company and certain of its employees were named on
    March 6, 2006 as defendants in a civil lawsuit brought by
    Grace & Digital Information Technology Co., Ltd.
    (“Grace”), a Chinese company that formerly acted as a
    sales agent for Alltel Information Services (“AIS”).

Grace originally filed suit in December 2004 in state court in
    Monterey County, California, alleging that the Company breached
    a sales agency agreement by failing to pay commissions
    associated with sales contracts signed in 2001 and 2003. The
    2001 contracts were never completed. The 2003 contracts, as to
    which Grace provided no assistance, were for a different project
    and were executed one and one-half years after Grace’s
    sales agency agreement was terminated. In addition to its breach
    of contract claim, Grace also alleged that the Company violated
    the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in its dealings with a
    bank customer in China. The Company denied Grace’s
    allegations in this California lawsuit.



In December 2005, the Monterey County court dismissed the
    lawsuit on the grounds of inconvenient forum, which decision
    Grace appealed on February 10, 2006. That appeal was
    subsequently dismissed voluntarily by Grace. On March 6,
    2006, Grace filed a new lawsuit in the United States District
    Court for the Middle District of Florida seeking the recovery of
    over $50 million in damages arising from the same
    transaction, and added an additional allegation to its complaint
    that the Company violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
    Organizations Act (RICO) in its dealings with the same bank
    customer. We intend to defend this case vigorously. On
    March 7, 2006, the Company filed its motion to dismiss this
    lawsuit, and on March 27, 2006, we filed an answer denying
    Grace’s underlying allegations and counterclaiming against
    Grace for tortious interference and abuse of process. These
    motions have all been fully briefed and are pending before the
    Court. A pretrial management order was entered providing for
    discovery, pretrial motion deadlines, and, if necessary, a trial
    in the later part of 2007.

We and our counsel have investigated these allegations and,
    based on the results of the investigations, we do not believe
    that there have been any violations of the FCPA or RICO, or that
    the ultimate disposition of these allegations or the lawsuit
    will have a material adverse impact on our financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows. We are fully cooperating
    with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
    U.S. Department of Justice in connection with their inquiry
    into these allegations.

As part of the merger transaction, Certegy declared a
    $3.75 per share special cash dividend that was paid to its
    pre-merger shareholders at the consummation of the Certegy
    Merger. As of February 1, 2007, there were approximately
    7,000 shareholders of record of our common stock.

Certegy, as the predecessor registrant, began declaring cash
    dividends to common shareholders in the third quarter of 2003.
    The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the
    discretion of the Board of Directors, and depends on, among
    other things, our investment policy and opportunities, results
    of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future
    prospects, and other factors that may be considered relevant by
    our Board of Directors, including legal and contractual
    restrictions. Additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be
    limited by



covenants in certain debt agreements. A regular quarterly
    dividend of $.05 per common share is payable March 28,
    2007 to shareholders on record as of the close of business on
    March 14, 2007.

Item 12 of Part III contains information concerning
    securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation
    plans.

The Company intends to limit dilution caused by option exercises
    (including anticipated exercises) by repurchasing shares in the
    open market or in privately negotiated transactions.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Overview

We are one of the largest global providers of processing
    services to financial institutions, with market-leading
    positions in core processing, card issuing services, check risk
    management, mortgage processing, and certain other lender
    processing services in the U.S., serving customers in over 60
    countries throughout the world. We offer a diversified product
    mix, and we believe that we will continue to benefit from the
    opportunity to cross-sell products and services across our broad
    customer base, and from our expanded international presence and
    scale. We have two reporting segments, Transaction Processing
    Services and Lender Processing Services, which produced
    approximately 59% and 41%, respectively, of our revenues for the
    year ended December 31, 2006.

•

Transaction Processing Services.

This
    segment focuses on serving the processing and risk management
    needs of financial institutions and retailers. Our primary
    software applications function as the underlying infrastructure
    of a financial institution’s processing environment. These
    applications include core bank processing software, which banks
    use to maintain the primary records of their customer accounts.
    We also provide a number of complementary applications and
    services that interact directly with the core processing
    applications, including applications that facilitate
    interactions between our financial institution customers and
    their clients. We offer our applications and services through a
    range of delivery and service models, including

on-site

outsourcing and remote processing arrangements, as well as on a
    licensed software basis for installation on customer-owned and
    operated systems. This segment also includes card issuer
    services



which enable banks, credit unions, and others to issue VISA and
    MasterCard credit and debit cards, private label cards, and
    other electronic payment cards for use by both consumer and
    business accounts. In addition we provide check guarantee and
    verification services to retailers.

•

Lender Processing Services.

This
    segment offers core mortgage processing software, which banks
    use to process and service mortgage loans, as well as customized
    outsourced business processes and information solutions
    primarily to national lenders and loan servicers. These loan
    facilitation services consist primarily of centralized,
    customized title agency and closing services offered to first
    mortgage, refinance, home equity and

sub-prime

lenders. In addition, this segment provides default management
    services to national lenders and loan servicers, allowing
    customers to outsource the business processes necessary to take
    a loan and the underlying real estate securing the loan through
    the default and foreclosure process. This segment also offers
    property data and real estate-related services. Included in
    these services are appraisal and valuation services, property
    records information, real estate tax services, and borrower
    credit and flood zone information.

We also have a corporate segment that consists primarily of
    costs relating to corporate overhead.

Business
    Trends and Conditions

Transaction
    Processing Services

In the transaction processing services business, increases in
    deposit and card transactions can positively affect our business
    and thus the condition of the overall economy can have an effect
    on growth.

In this segment, we compete for both licensing and outsourcing
    business, and thus are affected by the decisions of financial
    institutions to utilize our services under an outsourced
    arrangement or to process in-house under a software license and
    maintenance agreement. As a provider of outsourcing solutions,
    we benefit from multi-year recurring revenue streams. Generally,
    financial institutions of all sizes will consider outsourcing
    information technology and business process services to varying
    degrees, although smaller financial institutions are more likely
    to outsource all information technology functions to companies
    such as us since they generally do not have the staff, budget or
    expertise to implement and operate highly complex technical
    environments. Larger financial institutions have historically
    chosen to limit outsourcing to specific application functions or
    services in connection with a particular product or operation.
    Generally, demand for outsourcing solutions has increased over
    time as providers such as us realize economies of scale and
    improve their ability to provide services that improve customer
    efficiencies and reduce costs.

Card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total

point-of-sale

payments, which fuels continuing demand for card-related
    products. We continue to launch new products aimed at serving
    this demand. In recent years, we have introduced a variety of
    stored-value card types, Internet banking, and electronic bill
    presentment/payment products, as well as a number of card
    enhancement and loyalty/reward programs. The common theme among
    these offerings continues to be convenience and security for the
    consumer coupled with value to the financial institution.

We may be affected by the consolidation trend in the banking
    industry. This trend may be beneficial or detrimental to the
    Transaction Processing Services businesses. When consolidations
    occur, merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed
    from competing service providers. The newly formed entity
    generally makes a determination to migrate its core systems to a
    single platform. When a financial institution processing client
    is involved in a consolidation, we may benefit by expanding the
    use of our services if such services are chosen to survive the
    consolidation and support the newly combined entity. Conversely,
    we may lose market share if a customer of ours is involved in a
    consolidation and our services are not chosen to survive the
    consolidation and support the newly combined entity.

Lender
    Processing Services

Our mortgage processing services business, driven by MSP, is
    largely subject to the same types of factors as affect our
    financial institutions core processing business, described
    above. The level of residential real estate activity, which
    depends in part on the level of interest rates, affects the
    level of revenues from many of the other businesses in the
    Lender Processing Services segment.



The increase in interest rates in 2006 has resulted in a
    reduction in new loan origination and refinancing activity. The
    current MBA forecast is for $2.4 trillion of mortgage
    originations in 2007 as compared to $2.5 trillion in 2006.
    Relatively higher interest rates are also likely to result in
    seasonal effects having more influence on real estate activity.
    Traditionally, the greatest volume of real estate activity,
    particularly residential resale transactions, has occurred in
    the spring and summer months.

In contrast, we believe that a rising interest rate environment
    may increase the volume of consumer mortgage defaults and thus
    favorably affect our default management services, which provide
    services relating to residential mortgage loans in default. The
    overall strength of the economy also affects default revenues.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The accounting policies described below are those we consider
    critical in preparing our Consolidated and Combined Financial
    Statements. Certain of these policies require management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities and disclosures with respect to
    contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the
    Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and the reported
    amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
    Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. See
    Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial
    Statements for a more detailed description of the significant
    accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our
    Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

Revenue
    Recognition

The following describes our primary types of revenues and our
    revenue recognition policies as they pertain to the types of
    transactions we enter into with our customers. We enter into
    arrangements with customers to provide services, software and
    software related services such as post-contract customer support
    and implementation and training either individually or as part
    of an integrated offering of multiple products and services.
    These products and services occasionally include offerings from
    more than one segment to the same customer. The revenues for
    services provided under these multiple element arrangements are
    recognized in accordance with the applicable revenue recognition
    accounting principles as further described below.

In our TPS business, we recognize revenues relating to bank
    processing and credit and debit card processing services along
    with software licensing and software related services. Several
    of our contracts include a software license and one or more of
    the following services: data processing, development,
    implementation, conversion, training, programming, post-contract
    customer support and application management. In some cases,
    these services are offered in combination with one another and
    in other cases we offer them individually. Revenues from
    processing services are typically volume-based depending on
    factors such as the number of accounts processed, transactions
    processed and computer resources utilized.

The substantial majority of the revenues in the transaction
    processing services business are from outsourced data
    processing, credit and debit card processing, and application
    management arrangements. Revenues from these arrangements are
    recognized as services are performed in accordance with
    Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Staff
    Accounting Bulletin No. 104
    (“SAB No. 104”), “Revenue
    Recognition” and related interpretations.
    SAB No. 104 sets forth guidance as to when revenue is
    realized or realizable and earned when all of the following
    criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been
    rendered; (3) the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed
    and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably
    assured. Revenues and costs related to implementation,
    conversion and programming services associated with our data
    processing and application management agreements during the
    implementation phase are deferred and subsequently recognized
    using the straight-line method over the term of the related
    services agreement. We evaluate these deferred contract costs
    for impairment in the event any indications of impairment exist.
    A portion of credit card processing revenue is generated from
    our merchant institution processing business, where our
    relationship is with the financial institution that contracts
    directly with the merchant. In this business, we are responsible
    for collecting and settling interchange fees with the credit
    card associations, thus interchange fees are included as a
    component of revenue and costs of revenue.

In the event that arrangements with our customers include more
    than one product or service, we determine whether the individual
    revenue elements can be recognized separately in accordance with
    Financial Accounting



Standards Board (“FASB”) Emerging Issues Task Force

No. 00-21

(“EITF

00-21”),

“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables”.
    EITF

00-21

addresses the determination of whether an arrangement involving
    more than one deliverable contains more than one unit of
    accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be
    measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting.

If the products and services are software related products and
    services as determined under AICPA’s

SOP 97-2

“Software Revenue Recognition”

(“SOP 97-2”),

and

SOP 98-9

“Modification of

SOP No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain
    Transactions”

(“SOP 98-9”)

we apply these pronouncements and related interpretations to
    determine the appropriate units of accounting and how the
    arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to
    the separate units.

We recognize software license and post-contract customer support
    fees as well as associated development, implementation,
    training, conversion and programming fees in accordance with

SOP No. 97-2

and

SOP No. 98-9.

Initial license fees are recognized when a contract exists, the
    fee is fixed or determinable, software delivery has occurred and
    collection of the receivable is deemed probable, provided that
    vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) has been
    established for each element or for any undelivered elements. We
    determine the fair value of each element or the undelivered
    elements in multi-element software arrangements based on VSOE.
    If the arrangement is subject to accounting under

SOP No. 97-2,

VSOE for each element is based on the price charged when the
    same element is sold separately, or in the case of post-contract
    customer support, when a stated renewal rate is provided to the
    customer. If evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements
    exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered
    elements, then revenue is recognized using the residual method.
    Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered
    elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the
    arrangement fee is recognized as revenue. If evidence of fair
    value does not exist for one or more undelivered elements of a
    contract, then all revenue is deferred until all elements are
    delivered or fair value is determined for all remaining
    undelivered elements. Revenue from post-contract customer
    support is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. We
    record deferred revenue for all billings invoiced prior to
    revenue recognition.

With respect to a small percentage of revenues, we use contract
    accounting, as required by

SOP No. 97-2,

when the arrangement with the customer includes significant
    customization, modification, or production of software. For
    elements accounted for under contract accounting, revenue is
    recognized in accordance with

SOP 81-1,

“Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and
    Certain Production-Type Contracts”, using the

percentage-of-completion

method since reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and
    contract hours applicable to various elements of a contract can
    be made. Revenues in excess of billings on these agreements are
    recorded as unbilled receivables and are included in trade
    receivables. Billings in excess of revenue recognized on these
    agreements are recorded as deferred revenue until revenue
    recognition criteria are met. Changes in estimates for revenues,
    costs and profits are recognized in the period in which they are
    determinable. When our estimates indicate that the entire
    contract will be performed at a loss, a provision for the entire
    loss is recorded in that accounting period.

In our LPS business, we recognize revenues relating to mortgage
    processing services, loan facilitation services, default
    management services, and property data-related services.
    Mortgage processing arrangements are typically volume-based
    depending on factors such as the number of accounts processed,
    transactions processed and computer resources utilized. Revenue
    derived from software and service arrangements included in the
    lender processing services segment is recognized in accordance
    with

SOP No. 97-2

as discussed above. Loan facilitation services primarily consist
    of centralized title agency and closing services for various
    types of lenders. Revenues relating to loan facilitation
    services are typically recognized at the time of closing of the
    related real estate transaction. Ancillary service fees are
    recognized when the service is provided. Default management
    services assist customers through the default and foreclosure
    process, including property preservation and maintenance
    services (such as lock changes, window replacement, debris
    removal and lawn service), posting and publication of
    foreclosure and auction notices, title searches, document
    preparation and recording services, and referrals for legal and
    property brokerage services. Property data or data-related
    services principally include appraisal and valuation services,
    property records information, real estate tax services, borrower
    credit and flood zone information and multiple listing software
    and services. Revenues derived from these services are
    recognized as the services are performed in accordance with
    SAB No. 104 as described above.



In addition, our flood and tax units provide various services
    including

life-of-loan-monitoring

services. Revenue for

life-of-loan

services is deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated
    average life of the loan service period, which is determined
    based on our historical experience and industry data. We
    evaluate our historical experience on a periodic basis, and
    adjust the estimated life of the loan service period
    prospectively.

Reserves
    for Card Processing and Check Guarantee Losses

We recognize a reserve for estimated losses related to our card
    issuing business based on historical experience and other
    relevant factors. In our card issuing business, we record
    estimates to accrue for losses resulting from transaction
    processing errors. We utilize a number of systems and procedures
    within our card issuing business in order to minimize such
    transaction processing errors. Card processing loss reserves are
    primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our
    loss experience and considering other factors that could affect
    that experience in the future. Such factors include the general
    economy and the credit quality of customers. Once these factors
    are considered, we assess the reserve adequacy by comparing the
    recorded reserve to the estimated amount based on an analysis of
    the current trend changes or specific anticipated future events.
    Any adjustments are charged to costs of services. These card
    processing loss reserve amounts are subject to risk that actual
    losses may be different than our estimates.

In the check guarantee business, if a guaranteed check presented
    to a merchant customer is dishonored by the check writer’s
    bank, we reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s
    face value and pursue collection of the amount from the
    delinquent check writer. Loss reserves and anticipated
    recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical
    analysis of the check loss and recovery experience and
    considering other factors that could affect that experience in
    the future. Such factors include the general economy, the
    overall industry mix of our customer volumes, statistical
    analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes, and
    the quality of returned checks. Once these factors are
    considered, a rate is established for check losses that is
    calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar
    volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is
    calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total
    amount of related check losses. These rates are then applied
    against the dollar volume processed and check losses,
    respectively, each month and charged to cost of revenue. The
    estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk
    that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different from
    our estimates.

Computer
    Software

Computer software includes the fair value of software acquired
    in business combinations, purchased software and capitalized
    software development costs. Purchased software is recorded at
    cost and amortized using the straight line method over its
    estimated useful life and software acquired in business
    combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using
    straight line and accelerated methods over their estimated
    useful lives, ranging from 3 to 10 years.

Capitalized software development costs are accounted for in
    accordance with either SFAS No. 86, “Accounting
    for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or
    Otherwise Marketed” (SFAS No. 86), or with

SOP No. 98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use”. After the technological
    feasibility of the software has been established (for
    SFAS No. 86 software), or at the beginning of
    application development (for

SOP No. 98-1

software), software development costs, which include salaries
    and related payroll costs and costs of independent contractors
    incurred during development, are capitalized. Research and
    development costs incurred prior to the establishment of
    technological feasibility (for SFAS No. 86 software),
    or prior to application development (for

SOP No. 98-1

software), are expensed as incurred. Software development costs
    are amortized on a product by product basis commencing on the
    date of general release of the products (for
    SFAS No. 86 software) and the date placed in service
    for purchased software (for

SOP No. 98-1

software). Software development costs (for SFAS No. 86
    software) are amortized using the greater of (1) the
    straight line method over its estimated useful life, which
    ranges from five to ten years or (2) the ratio of current
    revenues to total anticipated revenue over its useful life.



Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

We have significant intangible assets that were acquired through
    business acquisitions. These assets consist of purchased
    customer relationships, contracts, and the excess of purchase
    price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired
    (goodwill). The determination of estimated useful lives and the
    allocation of the purchase price to the fair values of the
    intangible assets require significant judgment and may affect
    the amount of future amortization on the intangible assets other
    than goodwill.

As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005,
    goodwill was $3.7 billion and $1.8 billion,
    respectively. The process of determining whether or not an
    asset, such as goodwill, is impaired or recoverable relies on
    projections of future cash flows, operating results and market
    conditions. Such projections are inherently uncertain and,
    accordingly, actual future cash flows may differ materially from
    projected cash flows. In evaluating the recoverability of
    goodwill, we perform an annual goodwill impairment test on our
    reporting units based on an analysis of the discounted future
    net cash flows generated by the reporting units’ underlying
    assets. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test on our
    reporting units as of December 31, 2006 and determined that
    each of our reporting units has a fair value in excess of its
    carrying value. Accordingly, no goodwill impairment has been
    recorded. Such analyses are particularly sensitive to changes in
    estimates of future net cash flows and discount rates. Changes
    to these estimates might result in material changes in the fair
    value of the reporting units and determination of the
    recoverability of goodwill which may result in charges against
    earnings and a reduction in the carrying value of our goodwill.

As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005,
    intangible assets were $1.0 billion and $0.5 billion
    respectively, which consist primarily of purchased customer
    relationships and trademarks. The valuation of these assets
    involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning
    matters such as customer retention, future cash flows and
    discount rates. If any of these assumptions change, it could
    affect the carrying value of these assets. Purchased customer
    relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives
    using an accelerated method which takes into consideration
    expected customer attrition rates over a ten-year period. All
    trademarks have been determined to have indefinite lives and are
    not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually
    in accordance with SFAS No. 142. During 2005, we
    recorded an impairment of $9.3 million to write off the
    carrying value of customer relationships at one subsidiary in
    the Lender Processing Services segment which were terminated.

Long-Lived
    Assets

We review long-lived assets, primarily computer software,
    property and equipment and other intangibles, such as customer
    relationships and contracts, for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
    asset may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are
    present, we estimate the future net cash flows expected to be
    generated from the use of those assets and their eventual
    disposal. We would recognize an impairment loss if the aggregate
    future net cash flows were less than the carrying amount. As a
    result, the carrying values of these assets could be
    significantly affected by the accuracy of the estimates of
    future net cash flows, which are not capable of being made with
    certainty.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

Through March 9, 2005, our operating results have been
    included in Old FNF’s consolidated U.S. Federal and
    certain consolidated

and/or

combined State income tax returns. The provision for income
    taxes in the Consolidated and Combined statements of earnings is
    made at rates consistent with what we would have provided for as
    a stand-alone taxable entity. Subsequent to the recapitalization
    transaction and sale of minority interest, we became a
    stand-alone taxpayer. As part of the process of preparing the
    Consolidated and Combined financial statements, we were required
    to determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which
    we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax
    expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting
    from differing recognition of items for income tax and
    accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred income
    tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. We must then assess the likelihood
    that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future
    taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is
    not likely, establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we
    established a valuation allowance or increased this



allowance in a period, we must reflect this increase as an
    expense within income tax expense in the statement of earnings.
    Determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and
    can involve complex issues that may require an extended period
    to resolve. Further, changes in the geographic mix of revenues
    or in the estimated level of annual pre-tax income can cause the
    overall effective income tax rate to vary from period to period.

Derivatives
    and Hedging

We utilize interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure on our
    variable rate debt obligations. We have designated these
    interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges in accordance with
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities” as amended. All
    relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items
    are documented at the inception of the hedge transaction, as
    well as the risk-management objective and strategy for
    undertaking each hedge transaction. We carry the fair value of
    the interest rate swaps as an asset or a liability on the
    balance sheet at each reporting date, with a corresponding
    amount recorded in other comprehensive earnings within
    stockholders’ equity. Amounts are reclassified from other
    comprehensive earnings to the income statement in the periods
    that the hedged transaction affects earnings. A formal
    assessment is performed at the hedge’s inception and on a
    regular basis thereafter to determine whether the hedge has been
    highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the
    hedged transaction and whether it is expected to be highly
    effective in the future.

Our existing cash flow hedges have been highly effective and
    there has been no impact on earnings due to hedge
    ineffectiveness. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
    estimated fair value of cash flow hedges results in an asset of
    $4.9 million and $5.2 million, which is included in
    the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets
    with a corresponding amount recorded as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive earnings, net of deferred taxes.

Related
    Party Transactions

Transactions with FNF

We have historically conducted business with Old FNF and its
    subsidiaries. In March 2005, in connection with the
    recapitalization and sale of equity interest, we entered into
    various agreements with Old FNF under which we continued to
    provide title agency services, title plant management, and IT
    services. Further, we also entered into service agreements with
    Old FNF under which Old FNF continued to provide us with
    corporate services. In September 2005, when Fidelity National
    Title Group, Inc. (“FNT”) was formed and the title
    insurance business was consolidated under FNT, many of these
    agreements were amended and restated to take into account the
    services that would be performed for and by FNT rather than Old
    FNF. On February 1, 2006, in connection with the closing of
    the Certegy Merger, many of these agreements were further
    amended and restated to reflect certain changes in the
    parties’ relationships. Certain of these agreements were
    amended or terminated in connection with the FNF merger and
    related transactions, as described in our current report on

Form 8-K

filed with the SEC on October 27, 2006. A summary of these
    agreements as in effect through December 31, 2006 is as
    follows:

•

Agreement to provide data processing
    services.

This agreement governs the revenues to
    be earned by us for providing IT support services and software,
    primarily infrastructure support and data center management, to
    FNF. Subject to certain early termination provisions (including
    the payment of minimum monthly service and termination fees),
    this agreement has an initial term of five years from February
    2006 with an option to renew for one or two additional years.

•

Agreements to provide title plant information, maintenance
    and management.

These agreements govern the fee
    structure under which we are paid for maintaining, managing and
    updating title plants owned by FNF’s title underwriters in
    certain parts of the country. The title plant maintenance
    agreement requires, among other things, that we gather updated
    property information, organize it, input it into one of several
    systems, maintain or obtain the use of necessary software and
    hardware to store, access and deliver the data, sell and deliver
    the data to customers and provide various forms of customer
    support. We sell property information to title underwriters
    which are subsidiaries of FNF as well as to various unaffiliated
    customers. We pay FNF a royalty fee of 2.5% to 3.75% of the
    revenues received. In the case of the maintenance agreement, we
    are responsible for the costs of keeping the title plant assets
    current and functioning and in



return receive the revenue generated by those assets. Subject to
    certain early termination provisions for cause, each of these
    agreements may be terminated upon five years’ prior written
    notice, which notice may not be given until after the fifth
    anniversary of the effective date of the agreement in May 2005
    (thus effectively resulting in a minimum ten year term and a
    rolling one-year term thereafter).

•

Agreements to provide software development and
    services.

These agreements govern the fee
    structure under which we are paid for providing software
    development and services to FNF which consist of developing
    software for use in the title operations of FNF.

•

Arrangements to provide other real estate related
    services.

Under these arrangements we are paid
    for providing other real estate related services to FNF, which
    consist primarily of data services required by the title
    insurance operations.

•

Agreements by FNF to provide corporate services to
    us.

These agreements provide for FNF to provide
    general management, accounting, treasury, tax, finance, legal,
    payroll, human resources, employee benefits, internal audit,
    mergers and acquisitions, and other corporate and administrative
    support FIS. The pricing of these services is at cost for
    services which are either directly attributable to us, or in
    certain circumstances, an allocation of our share of the total
    costs incurred by FNF in providing such services based on
    estimates that FNF and FIS believe to be reasonable.

•

Licensing, leasing and cost sharing
    agreements.

These agreements provide for the
    reimbursement of certain amounts from FNF or its subsidiaries
    related to various miscellaneous licensing, leasing, and cost
    sharing agreements, as well as the payment of certain amounts by
    us to FNF (or their subsidiaries) in connection with our use of
    certain intellectual property or other assets of or services by
    FNF.

•

Agreements to provide title agency
    services.

These agreements allow us to provide
    services to existing customers through loan facilitation
    transactions, primarily with large national lenders. The
    arrangement involves FIS providing title agency services which
    result in the issuance of title policies by FIS on behalf of
    title insurance underwriters owned by FNF and subsidiaries.
    Subject to certain early termination provisions for cause, each
    of these agreements may be terminated upon five years’
    prior written notice, which notice may not be given until after
    the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the agreement
    ranging from July 2004 through September 2006 for various
    agreements (thus effectively resulting in a minimum ten year
    term and a rolling one-year term thereafter). The LPS segment
    includes revenues from unaffiliated third parties of
    $83.9 million, $80.9 million and $92.2 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively, representing commissions on title insurance
    policies written by us on behalf of title insurance subsidiaries
    of FNF. These commissions are equal to 88% of the total title
    premium from title policies that we place with subsidiaries of
    FNF. We also perform similar functions in connection with
    trustee sale guarantees, a form of title insurance that
    subsidiaries of FNF issue as part of the foreclosure process on
    a defaulted loan.

We believe the amounts earned from or charged by FNF to us under
    each of the foregoing service arrangements are fair and
    reasonable. Although the 88% commission rate on title insurance
    policies was set without negotiation, we believe it is
    consistent with the blended rate that would be available to a
    third party title agent given the amount and the geographic
    distribution of the business produced and the low risk of loss
    profile of the business placed. In connection with title plant
    management, we charge FNF title insurers for title information
    at approximately the same rates we and other similar vendors
    charge unaffiliated title insurers. Our IT infrastructure
    support and data center management services to FNF are priced
    within the range of prices we offer to third parties.

We also provide data processing services to Sedgwick CMS, a
    company in which FNF has held an approximately 40% equity
    interest since February 1, 2006. We recorded
    $17.3 million in revenue relating to this arrangement with
    Sedgwick in 2006.

Other transactions with FNF:

Contribution of National New York

During the second quarter of 2006, Old FNF contributed the stock
    of National Title Insurance of New York, Inc.
    (“National New York”), a title insurance company, to
    us, in connection with the recapitalization transaction in March
    2005. This transaction was reflected as a contribution of
    capital from Old FNF in the amount of Old FNF’s historical
    basis in National New York of approximately $10.7 million.

Merger with FNF Capital

On October 26, 2006, we completed a merger with FNF
    Capital, Inc. (“FNF Capital”) a leasing subsidiary of
    Old FNF. We issued 279,000 shares of our common stock to
    Old FNF in exchange for a majority ownership in FNF Capital. The
    transaction was recorded at Old FNF’s historical basis in
    FNF Capital of approximately $2.3 million and we purchased
    the minority ownership shortly thereafter for $3.8 million
    in cash.

The contribution of National New York and the merger with FNF
    Capital were completed between entities under common control and
    their results of operations and account balances have been
    included in our results of operations and statement of financial
    position since the date of the relevant transactions. Had we
    included the results of operations and balance sheets for all
    periods presented in our Combined and Consolidated Financial
    Statements, net earnings would have been adjusted by
    $0.5 million, ($0.2) million and ($0.7) million
    for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and total assets would
    have increased $82.2 million as of December 31, 2005.

Investment by FNF in Fidelity National Real Estate Solutions,
    Inc.

On December 31, 2006, FNF contributed $52.5 million to
    Fidelity National Real Estate Solutions,
    Inc.(“FNRES”), our subsidiary, for approximately 61%
    of the outstanding shares of FNRES. As a result, as of
    December 31, 2006, we no longer consolidate FNRES, but
    record our remaining 39% interest as an equity investment in the
    amount of $33.5 million. The results of FNRES are included
    in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings for all
    periods presented.

Transactions with Covansys

In 2004, we entered into a master service provider agreement
    with Covansys, an entity in which we hold a 29% equity interest,
    which requires that we purchase a minimum of $150 million
    in services over a five year period expiring June 30, 2009
    or be subject to certain penalties if defined spending
    thresholds are not met. We do not believe any future penalties
    will be incurred under the agreement. During 2006, 2005, and
    2004, we spent $35.7 million, $17.6 million and
    $5.0 million purchasing professional services from Covansys
    and its subsidiaries.



Transactions with Banco Bradesco S.A. and ABN AMRO Real

In 2006, we recorded revenues of $22.8 million from ABN
    AMRO Real and $20.4 million from Banco Bradesco S.A., which
    are venture partners in our Brazilian Card business.

Recent
    Developments

Combination
    with Old FNF

On June 25, 2006, we entered into an agreement and plan of
    merger (the “FNF Merger Agreement”) with Old FNF
    (amended September 18, 2006) (the “FNF Merger”).
    This FNF Merger was one step in a plan that eliminated Old
    FNF’s holding company structure and majority ownership in
    FIS. In connection with this plan, Old FNF also entered into a
    securities exchange and distribution agreement (the
    “SEDA”) with its subsidiary FNT. Under the SEDA, Old
    FNF agreed that, prior to the merger, Old FNF would transfer
    substantially all its assets and liabilities to FNT, in exchange
    for shares of FNT common stock. Old FNF then would spin-off all
    shares of FNT stock it held to the stockholders of Old FNF in a
    tax-free distribution. Pursuant to the FNF Merger Agreement, on
    November 9, 2006 Old FNF merged with and into FIS, with FIS
    continuing as the surviving corporation. In consideration for
    the FNF Merger, Old FNF stockholders received an aggregate of
    96,521,877 shares of our stock for their Old FNF shares. In
    addition, in connection with the FNF Merger we issued options to
    purchase our common stock and shares of our restricted stock in
    exchange for Old FNF options and restricted stock outstanding at
    the time of the FNF Merger. After the completion of all of the
    transactions, FNT was renamed Fidelity National Financial, Inc.
    (“FNF”) and trades under the symbol FNF. Former Old
    FNF Chairman and CEO William P. Foley, II, assumed the same
    position in FNF and now serves as Executive Chairman of FIS, and
    other key members of Old FNF senior management continue their
    involvement in both FNF and FIS in executive capacities.

U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that
    one of the two parties to the FNF Merger be designated as the
    acquirer for accounting purposes. However, Financial Accounting
    Standards Board Technical

Bulletin 85-5,

“Issues Relating to Accounting for Business
    Combinations” provides that if a transaction lacks
    substance, it is not a purchase event and should be accounted
    for based on existing carrying amounts. In the FNF Merger, the
    minority interest in FIS has not changed and, in substance, the
    only assets and liabilities of the combined entity after the
    exchange are those of FIS prior to the exchange. Because a
    change in ownership of the minority interest has not taken
    place, the exchange has been accounted for based on the carrying
    amounts of our assets and liabilities.

Factors
    Affecting Comparability

Our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in
    this report that present our financial condition and operating
    results reflect the following significant transactions:

•

On February 1, 2006, Former FIS merged into a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of Certegy. The transaction resulted in a reverse
    acquisition with a total purchase price of approximately
    $2.2 billion. Certegy provided credit card, debit card, and
    other transaction processing and check risk management services
    to financial institutions and merchants in the U.S. and
    internationally through two segments, Card Services and Check
    Services.

•

On March 9, 2005, our recapitalization was completed
    through $2.8 billion in borrowings under senior credit
    facilities consisting of an $800 million Term Loan A
    facility, a $2.0 billion Term Loan B facility
    (collectively, the “Term Loan Facilities”) and a
    $400 million revolving credit facility (the
    “Revolver”). We fully drew upon the entire
    $2.8 billion in Term Loan Facilities to complete the
    recapitalization while the Revolver remained undrawn at the
    closing. At the same time, we also sold a 25 percent equity
    interest to an investment group led by Thomas H. Lee Partners
    (“THL”) and Texas Pacific Group (“TPG”).

•

During 2004, we acquired Aurum Technology (Aurum), Sanchez
    Computer Associates, Inc. (Sanchez), Kordoba and InterCept Inc.
    (InterCept) which added significant revenues to our TPS segment.

The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements present the
    results of operations of Certegy, the effects of the
    recapitalization and results of operations of the 2004
    acquisitions, in each case, effective as of the date of the



acquisition or recapitalization. As a result of these
    transactions, the results of operations in the periods covered
    by the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements may not be
    directly comparable.

Processing
    and Services Revenues

Processing and services revenues totaled $4,132.6 million,
    $2,766.1 million and $2,331.5 million in 2006, 2005
    and 2004, respectively. The increase in revenue in 2006 of
    $1,366.5 million as compared to 2005 is primarily due to
    incremental revenues from the February 1, 2006 Certegy
    Merger, which contributed $1,067.2 million to the overall
    increase. The remaining 2006 increase is attributable to growth
    across both segments, including 15.2% growth in Transaction
    Processing Services, excluding the impact of Certegy, and 7.5%
    growth in Lender Processing Services. The growth in Transaction
    Processing Services was driven by strong new sales within
    Integrated Financial Solutions and International, while the
    growth in Lender Processing Services was driven by market share
    gains in default and appraisal services. The increase in revenue
    in 2005 of $434.6 million as compared to 2004 is primarily
    attributable to an increase of $316.4 million, or 35.5%,
    from our Transaction Processing Services segment which is the
    result of including a full year of results for the 2004
    acquisitions of Aurum, Sanchez, Kordoba, and InterCept which
    contributed $301.1 million of the increase. The remaining
    2005 increase is primarily due to organic growth across the
    company.



Cost of
    Revenues

Cost of revenues totaled $2,929.6 million,
    $1,793.3 million and $1,525.2 million in 2006, 2005
    and 2004 respectively. The increase in cost of revenues in 2006
    as compared to 2005 of $1,136.3 million was primarily due
    to incremental cost of revenues from the February 1, 2006
    Certegy Merger which contributed $848.2 million to the
    overall increase. An increase in depreciation and amortization
    expense to $383.0 million in 2006 from $252.5 million
    in 2005 resulting from additional intangible amortization
    related to the Certegy Merger also contributed to the

year-over-year

increase. The increase in cost of revenues of
    $268.1 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 is primarily
    attributable to including a full year of results for the 2004
    acquisitions of Aurum, Sanchez, Kordoba, and InterCept including
    the amortization of intangibles related to each acquisition.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit as a percentage of revenues (“gross
    margin”) was 29.1%, 35.2% and 34.6% in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to
    the February 1, 2006 Certegy Merger, which businesses
    typically have lower margins than those of the historically
    owned FIS businesses. Incremental intangible amortization
    expense relating to the Certegy Merger also contributed to the
    decrease in gross margin in 2006. The increase in gross margin
    in 2005 as compared to 2004 resulted from the full year of
    results for the 2004 acquisitions.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled
    $505.5 million, $422.6 million and $432.3 million
    for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase of
    $82.9 million in selling, general and administrative
    expenses for 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily relates to
    incremental selling, general and administrative expenses from
    the February 1, 2006 Certegy Merger which contributed
    $73.7 million to the overall increase. Additionally, the
    increase was also due to an increase in stock based compensation
    expense which increased from $20.4 million during 2005 to
    $50.1 million for 2006. This increase in stock-based
    compensation is primarily attributable to the $24.5 million
    in expense recorded for the vesting of the FIS performance-based
    options granted in March 2005 for which the performance criteria
    was met during the first quarter of 2006 and an acceleration
    charge of $6.1 million recorded in the fourth quarter
    relating to the FNF Merger. The decrease of $9.7 million in
    2005 as compared to 2004 primarily results from cost control
    measures implemented in 2005 related to the 2004 acquisitions.
    Also included in selling, general and administrative expenses
    are $50.5 million, $47.1 million, and
    $40.5 million in depreciation and amortization costs in
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Research
    and Development Costs

Research and development costs totaled $105.6 million,
    $113.5 million and $74.2 for 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. The increase of $39.3 million in 2005 as
    compared to 2004 reflects an increase in research and
    development activity surrounding the acquired technology assets
    associated with the 2004 acquisitions of Aurum, Sanchez,
    Bankware, Kordoba, and InterCept.

Operating
    Income

Operating income totaled $591.9 million,
    $436.7 million and $299.8 million for 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of revenue
    (“operating margin”) was 14.3%, 15.8% and 12.9% for
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The

year-over-year

decrease in operating margin for 2006 is primarily due to
    incremental intangible asset amortization relating to the
    Certegy Merger, increased stock based compensation costs, other
    merger related costs, as well as relatively lower gross profit
    percentage associated with the Certegy product lines, as noted
    above. The increase in operating margin for 2005 as compared to
    2004 is primarily attributable to the higher revenues associated
    with 2004 acquisitions, for which there was a full year of
    results in 2005. The addition of these acquisitions resulted in
    a higher revenue base for spreading more stable administrative
    costs.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense totaled $192.8 million,
    $126.8 million and $4.5 million for 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2006 as
    compared to 2005 primarily relates to an increase in interest
    rates and



higher average borrowings. Additionally, the recapitalization
    that occurred late in the first quarter of 2005 resulted in a
    full year of interest in 2006 as compared to approximately ten
    months in 2005. The increase in interest expense in 2005 as
    compared to 2004 also resulted from the recapitalization in 2005.

Income
    Tax Expense

Income tax expense totaled $150.2 million,
    $116.1 million and $118.3 million for 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively. This resulted in an effective tax rate of
    37.2%, 37.2% and 37.6% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Net
    Earnings

Net earnings totaled $259.1 million, $196.6 and
    $189.4 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, or
    $1.37, $1.53 and $1.48 per diluted share, respectively.

Revenues for the Transaction Processing Services segment are
    derived from three main revenue channels; Enterprise Solutions,
    Integrated Financial Solutions and International. Revenues from
    Transaction Processing Services totaled $2,458.8 million,
    $1,208.4 and $892.0 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. The overall segment increase of
    $1,250.4 million during 2006, as compared to 2005 was
    primarily attributable to the Certegy Merger which contributed
    $1,067.2 million to the overall increase. The majority of
    the remaining 2006 growth is attributable to organic growth
    within the historically owned Integrated Financial Solutions and
    International revenue channels, with International including
    $31.9 million related to the newly formed business process
    outsourcing operation in Brazil. The overall segment increase of
    $316.4 in 2005 as compared to 2004 results from the inclusion of
    a full year of results for the 2004 acquisitions of Aurum,
    Sanchez, Kordoba, and InterCept, which contributed
    $301.1 million of the increase.

Cost of revenues for the Transaction Processing Services segment
    totaled $1,914.1 million, $904.1 million and
    $667.1 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
    overall segment increase of $1,010.0 million during 2006 as
    compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to the Certegy
    Merger which contributed $848.2 million to the increase.
    Gross profit as a percentage of revenues (“gross
    margin”) was 22.2%, 25.2% and 25.2% for 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively. The decrease in gross profit in 2006 as
    compared to 2005 is primarily due to the February 1, 2006
    Certegy Merger, which businesses typically have lower margins
    than those of the historically owned FIS businesses. Incremental
    intangible asset amortization relating to the Certegy Merger
    also contributed to the decrease in gross margin. Included in
    cost of revenues was depreciation and amortization of
    $272.4 million, $139.8 million, and $94.6 million
    for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled
    $171.1 million, $94.9 million and $99.6 million
    for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2006
    compared to 2005 is primarily attributable to the Certegy Merger
    which contributed $73.7 million to the overall increase of
    $76.2 million. The decrease of $4.7 million in 2005 as
    compared to 2004 is primarily attributable to the effect of
    acquisition related costs in 2004. Included in selling, general
    and administrative expenses was depreciation and amortization of
    $11.0 million, $9.1 million and $2.3 million for
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.



Research and development costs totaled $70.9 million,
    $85.7 million and $54.0 million for 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively. The increase of $31.7 million in 2005
    as compared to 2004 reflects an increase in research and
    development activity surrounding the acquired technology assets
    associated with the 2004 acquisitions of Aurum, Sanchez,
    Bankware, Kordoba, and Intercept.

Operating income totaled $302.6 million,
    $123.7 million and $71.3 million for 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively. Operating margin was approximately 12.3%,
    10.2% and 8.0% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The increase in operating margin for 2006 as compared to 2005
    resulted from a decrease, as a percentage of revenue, of 0.9% in
    selling, general and administrative expenses and 4.2% in
    research and development costs, partially offset by a decrease
    in gross margin as discussed above. The increase in 2005, as
    compared to 2004, primarily results from the relative stability
    of selling, general and administrative expenses against a larger
    revenue base due to the inclusion of a full year of results for
    the 2004 acquisitions.

Revenues for the Lender Processing Services segment totaled
    $1,678.6 million, $1,562.2 million and
    $1,445.0 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
    overall segment increase of $116.4 million during 2006 as
    compared to 2005 was the result of growth across most of the
    business lines, but primarily due to increased demand for our
    appraisal services along with growth in our default management
    businesses.

Cost of revenues for the Lender Processing Services segment
    totaled $1,015.4 million, $889.2 million and
    $858.2 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Gross
    margin was 39.5%, 43.1% and 40.6% for 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to
    growth in lower margin product lines including default and
    appraisal services along with declining margins in our tax
    services due to the lengthening of the service period. Included
    in cost of revenues was depreciation and amortization of
    $110.6 million, $112.8 million and $103.3 million
    for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Lender
    Processing Services segment totaled $208.7 million,
    $234.7 million and $261.0 million for 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively. The decreasing trend is primarily the result
    of cost control measures and the increased revenue base in the
    Transaction Processing Services segment for allocating certain
    combined selling and administrative expenses. Included in
    selling, general and administrative expenses was depreciation
    and amortization of $29.2 million, $31.8 million, and
    $35.1 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Research and development costs for the Lender Processing
    Services segment totaled $34.7 million, $27.8 million,
    and $20.2 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
    The increasing trend relates primarily to additional activities
    surrounding our mortgage processing and loan origination
    software lines.

Operating income for the Lender Processing Services segment
    totaled $419.8 million, $410.5 million, and
    $305.6 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
    Operating margin was 25.0%, 26.3% and 21.1% for 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively.

Corporate
    and Other

Selling, general and administrative expenses from the Corporate
    and Other segment consist of corporate overhead costs that have
    been allocated from FNF prior to the merger with FNF and other
    amounts incurred directly



by FIS, including stock based compensation. Selling, general and
    administrative expenses were $125.7 million,
    $93.1 million and $71.7 million in 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively. The increase in 2006 as compared to 2005 of
    $32.6 million primarily relates to an increase in stock
    based compensation expense which increased from
    $20.4 million in 2005 to $50.1 million in 2006, as
    well as an increase in merger and merger related integration
    costs. The increase in stock based compensation primarily
    related to the $24.5 million in expense recorded in the
    first quarter of 2006 for the vesting of the FIS performance
    based options granted in March of 2005 for which the performance
    criteria were met during 2006 and a $6.1 million charge
    related to the acceleration of vesting of stock options recorded
    in the fourth quarter relating to the FNF merger.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Cash
    Requirements

Our cash requirements include cost of revenues, selling, general
    and administrative expenses, income taxes, debt service
    payments, capital expenditures, systems development expenditures
    and business acquisitions. Our principal sources of funds are
    cash generated by operations and borrowings.

At December 31, 2006, we have cash on hand of
    $211.8 million and long-term debt including the current
    portion of approximately $3.0 billion. We expect cash flows
    from operations over the next twelve months will be sufficient
    to fund our operating cash requirements, and pay principal and
    interest on our outstanding debt absent any unusual
    circumstances such as acquisitions or adverse changes in the
    business environment.



We currently pay quarterly dividends to our shareholders of
    $0.05 per share and expect to continue to do so in the
    future, although the payment of any future dividends is at the
    discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to any limits
    in our debt or other agreements.

We intend to limit dilution caused by option exercises,
    including anticipated exercises, by repurchasing shares on the
    open market or in privately negotiated transactions. During
    2006, we repurchased 4,261,200 shares at an average price
    of $37.60 under this program. On October 25, 2006, our
    Board of Directors approved a plan authorizing repurchases up to
    an additional $200 million worth of our common stock.

Capital
    Expenditures

Our principal capital expenditures are for computer software and
    additions to property and equipment. In 2006, we spent
    approximately $300.2 million on capital expenditures and in
    2007, we expect to spend approximately $300 million,
    primarily on equipment, purchased software and internally
    developed software.

Financing

On March 9, 2005, FIS completed a recapitalization. FIS
    entered into $3.2 billion in senior credit facilities
    consisting of an $800 million Term Loan A facility, a
    $2.0 billion Term Loan B facility (collectively, the
    “Term Loan Facilities”) and a $400 million
    revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) with a
    consortium of lenders led by Bank of America. FIS fully drew
    upon the entire $2.8 billion in Term Loan Facilities
    to consummate the recapitalization. FIS used proceeds from the
    loans to repay the outstanding principal and interest on a
    $2.7 billion note it previously issued as a dividend to
    FNF. Revolving credit borrowings and Term A and B Loans bore
    interest at a floating rate and as a result of scheduled and
    other repayments, the aggregate principal balance of the Term
    Loan Facilities at December 31, 2006 was
    $2.5 billion. These credit facilities were paid in full as
    a result of the refinancing transaction completed on
    January 18, 2007 as described below.

FIS used proceeds from the Term Loans to repay all outstanding
    principal and interest on a $2.7 billion principal amount
    promissory note that it distributed to FNF as a dividend on
    March 8, 2005. On March 9, 2005, FIS also completed
    its minority interest sale, in which it issued common shares
    representing a 25% interest in FIS to an investor group for
    $500 million. FIS used the proceeds of that issuance and
    the remaining Term Loan proceeds to retire its former revolving
    credit facility and pay expenses relating to the
    recapitalization and the minority interest sale. These expenses
    totaled $79.2 million, and included certain fees and
    expenses of the investor group totaling approximately
    $45.7 million. The remaining proceeds from the Term Loans
    and minority interest sale were retained to use for general
    corporate purposes.

On January 18, 2007, we entered into a credit agreement
    with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing
    Line Lender, and L/C Issuer, Bank of America, N.A., as Swing
    Line Lender, and other financial institutions party thereto (the
    “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement replaces the
    Bank of America Term Loan and Revolver as well as the
    $100 million Wachovia Settlement Facility. The Credit
    Agreement, which is unsecured, provides for a committed
    $2.1 billion five-year term facility denominated in
    U.S. Dollars (the “JPM Term Loan”) and a
    committed $900 million revolving credit facility (the
    “JPM Revolving Loan”) with a sublimit of
    $250 million for letters of credit and a sublimit of
    $250 million for swing line loans, maturing on the fifth
    anniversary of the closing date (the “Maturity Date”).
    The JPM Revolving Loan is bifurcated into a $735 million
    multicurrency revolving credit loan (the “Multicurrency
    Tranche”) that can be denominated in any combination of
    U.S. Dollars, Euro, British Pounds Sterling and Australian
    Dollars, and any other foreign currency in which the relevant
    lenders agree to make advances and a $165 million
    U.S. Dollar revolving credit loan that can be denominated
    only in U.S. Dollars. The swingline loans and letters of
    credit are available as a sublimit under the Multicurrency
    Tranche. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for an
    uncommitted incremental loan facility in the uncommitted maximum
    principal amount of $600 million, which will be made
    available only upon receipt of further commitments from lenders
    under the Credit Agreement sufficient to fund the amount
    requested by FIS.

The JPM Term Loan was fully drawn on the closing date and a
    total of $557 million was borrowed under the JPM Revolving
    Loan on the closing date. The obligations under the Credit
    Agreement have been jointly and severally, unconditionally
    guaranteed by substantially all of the domestic subsidiaries of
    the Company.



FIS may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts under the JPM
    Revolving Loan from time to time until the maturity of the JPM
    Revolving Loan. FIS must make quarterly principal payments under
    the JPM Term Loan in scheduled installments of:
    (a) $13,125,000 per quarter from March 31, 2007
    through December 31, 2008; (b) $26,250,000 per
    quarter from March 31, 2009 through December 31, 2009;
    and (c) $52,500,000 per quarter from March 31,
    2010 through September 30, 2011, with the remaining balance
    of approximately $1,522,500,000 payable on the Maturity Date.

In addition to the scheduled principal payments, the JPM Term
    Loan is (with certain exceptions) subject to mandatory
    prepayment upon issuances of debt, casualty and condemnation
    events, and sales of assets. Voluntary prepayments of the Loans
    are generally permitted at any time without fee upon proper
    notice and subject to a minimum dollar requirement. Commitment
    reductions of the JPM Revolving Loan are also permitted at any
    time without fee upon proper notice. The JPM Revolving Loan has
    no scheduled principal payments, but it will be due and payable
    in full on the Maturity Date.

The outstanding balance of the Loans bear interest at a floating
    rate, which is at our option, either (a) the eurocurrency
    rate plus an applicable margin and mandatory cost or (b) a
    base rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is
    subject to adjustment based on a leverage ratio (total
    indebtedness to EBITDA of the Company and its consolidated
    subsidiaries, as further defined in the Credit Agreement).
    Alternatively, the Company has the ability to request the
    lenders to submit competitive bids for one or more advances
    under the JPM Revolving Loan (“Bid Rate Advances”).

The Credit Agreement provides procedures for lenders to submit
    bids for Bid Rate Advances and for the Company to accept or
    reject them. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative
    and financial covenants customary for financings of this type,
    including, among other things, limits on the creation of liens,
    limits on the incurrence of indebtedness, restrictions on
    investments and dispositions, limitations on dividends and other
    restricted payments, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a
    maximum leverage ratio. Upon an event of default, the
    Administrative Agent can accelerate the maturity of the loan.
    Events of default include conditions customary for such an
    agreement, including failure to pay principal and interest in a
    timely manner and breach of certain covenants.

The foregoing does not constitute a complete summary of the
    terms of the Credit Agreement and reference is made to the
    complete text of the agreement, which was filed as
    Exhibit 10.1 to

Form 8-K

dated January 19, 2007.

In connection with the new Credit Agreement, the Company
    terminated the Bank of America Term Loan and Revolver on
    January 18, 2007 and repaid it in full before its final
    scheduled expiration date of March 9, 2013. The final
    payment was approximately $2.64 billion, including
    principal, interest and fees. The Company incurred no early
    termination penalties in terminating the Bank of America credit
    agreement.

In connection with the Certegy Merger, the Company has an
    obligation to service $200 million (aggregate principal
    amount) of unsecured 4.75% fixed-rate notes due in September
    2008. The notes were recorded in purchase accounting at a
    discount of $5.7 million, which is being amortized on a
    straight-line basis over the term of the notes. The notes accrue
    interest at a rate of 4.75% per year, payable semi-annually
    in arrears on each March 15 and September 15.

The Company had a $100 million unsecured revolving credit
    facility that it used to finance its customers’ shortfalls
    in the daily funding requirements associated with the
    Company’s credit and debit card settlement operations
    (“Settlement Facility”). Amounts borrowed were
    typically repaid within one to two business days, as customers
    funded the shortfalls. This facility had a term of 364 days
    and was renewed annually. There were no amounts outstanding
    under this facility at December 31, 2006. The Settlement
    Facility was terminated on January 18, 2007.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

FIS does not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements,
    other than the Wisconsin operating leases disclosed below and in
    Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial
    Statements.

The Company has a synthetic lease arrangement (the
    “Wisconsin Lease”) which is not included in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets with respect to its
    facilities in Madison, Wisconsin (the “Wisconsin Leased
    Property”). In connection with the Certegy Merger, the term
    of the Wisconsin Lease was amended so that it was scheduled to
    expire on December 31, 2006. The term of the Wisconsin
    Lease has since been further amended so that it now expires on
    June 30, 2007. The original cost to the lessor of the
    Wisconsin Leased Property when Certegy entered into the
    Wisconsin Lease was approximately $10.1 million. Subject to
    the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Company has the
    option to acquire the Wisconsin Leased Property at its original
    cost, or to direct the sale of the Wisconsin Leased Property to
    a third party.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Post Retirement Plans” (“SFAS 158”).
    SFAS 158 requires entities to recognize on their balance
    sheets the funded status of pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans. Entities are required to recognize actuarial
    gains and losses, prior service cost, and any remaining
    transition amounts from the initial application of
    SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Pensions,” and SFAS No. 106,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
    Other Than Pensions,” when recognizing a plan’s funded
    status, with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive
    income. SFAS 158 will not change the amounts recognized in
    the income statement as net periodic benefit cost. All of the
    requirements of SFAS 158 are effective as of
    December 31, 2006 for calendar-year public companies,
    except for a requirement for

fiscal-year-end

measurements of plan assets and benefit obligations with which
    the Company is already in compliance. Adoption of this standard
    resulted in the Company recording a $6.9 million

pre-tax

adjustment to other long-term liabilities and other
    comprehensive income.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
    issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (Topic 1N),
    “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements” (SAB 108). This SAB addresses how the
    effects of prior-year uncorrected misstatements should be
    considered when quantifying misstatements in current-year
    financial statements. SAB 108 requires registrants to
    quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income
    statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach
    results in quantifying an error that is material in light of
    relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. When the effect
    of initial adoption is determined to be material, the SAB allows
    registrants to record that effect as a cumulative effect
    adjustment to

beginning-of-year

retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for annual
    financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after
    November 15, 2006. Adoption of this standard had no effect
    on the Company’s statements of financial position and
    operations.

In June 2006, The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
    FASB Interpretation Number 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”. FIN 48 is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The
    interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in
    income taxes recognized in the financial statements in
    accordance with FASB Statement Number 109, Accounting for Income
    Taxes. The interpretation



outlines recognition thresholds and measurement attributes to
    determine the amount, if any, of a tax benefit to be recognized
    in an enterprise’s financial statements. The Interpretation
    also provides guidance on subsequent recognition,
    de-recognition, measurement, recognition of interest and
    penalties, classification and disclosure. The Company has
    reviewed FIN 48 and has determined that its implementation
    will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 123R
    (“SFAS No. 123R”), “Share-Based
    Payment,” which requires that compensation cost relating to
    share-based payments be recognized in the financial statements.
    During 2003, FIS adopted the fair value recognition provision of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
    (“SFAS No. 123”), for stock-based employee
    compensation, effective as of the beginning of 2003. FIS had
    elected to use the prospective method of transition, as
    permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure”
    (“SFAS No. 148”). Under this method,
    stock-based employee compensation cost was recognized from the
    beginning of 2003 as if the fair value method of accounting had
    been used to account for all employee awards granted, modified,
    or settled in years beginning after December 31, 2002.
    SFAS No. 123R does not allow for the prospective
    method, but requires the recording of expense relating to the
    vesting of all unvested options beginning in the first quarter
    of 2006. Since SFAS No. 123 was adopted in 2003, the
    impact of recording additional expense in 2006 under
    SFAS No. 123R relating to options granted prior to
    January 1, 2003 is not significant as all options accounted
    for under other methods were fully vested as of
    December 31, 2005.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks

FIS is highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2006, it was
    paying interest on the Term Loan Facilities and Revolver at
    a rate of LIBOR plus 1.25 to 1.75%, or (6.60-7.10%). As of
    January 18, 2007, FIS was paying interest on the new Credit
    Agreement at LIBOR plus 1.00%. A one percent increase in the
    LIBOR rate would increase its annual debt service on the Credit
    Agreement by $22.6 million (based on amounts outstanding at
    December 31, 2006). The credit rating assigned to FIS by
    Standard & Poor’s is currently BB+ with a positive
    outlook.

On April 11, 2005, FIS entered into interest rate swap
    agreements which have effectively fixed the interest rate at
    approximately 5.4% through April 2008 on $350 million of
    the term loan facilities and at approximately 5.2% through April
    2007 on an additional $350 million of the term loan
    facilities. The estimated fair value of the cash flow hedges
    results in an asset of FIS of $4.9 million as of
    December 31, 2006, which is included in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets in other noncurrent assets and as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings, net of
    deferred taxes.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting, that Fidelity National Information
    Services, Inc. and subsidiaries and affiliates (the Company)
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). Fidelity National Information Services,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
    of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
    reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
    management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness
    of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Fidelity
    National Information Services, Inc. maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on criteria established in Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. Also, in our
    opinion, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
    criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Fidelity National Information
    Services, Inc. and subsidiaries and affiliates as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
    and combined statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, and our
    report dated March 1, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion
    on those consolidated and combined financial statements.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and subsidiaries
    and affiliates (the Company) as of December 31, 2006 and
    2005, and the related consolidated and combined statements of
    earnings, comprehensive earnings, stockholders’ equity, and
    cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2006. These consolidated and combined
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated and combined financial statements
    based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated and combined financial
    statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
    respects, the financial position of Fidelity National
    Information Services, Inc. and subsidiaries and affiliates as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.
    and subsidiaries and affiliates’ internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated
    March 1, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of,
    internal control over financial reporting.

As discussed in note 5 to the consolidated and combined
    financial statements, the Company completed a merger with
    Certegy Inc. on February 1, 2006.

    AFFILIATES

CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1)  Basis
    of Presentation

Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (“FIS” or
    the “Company”) is a leading provider of technology
    solutions, processing services, and information-based services
    to the financial services industry. The Company’s formation
    began in early 2004 and was substantially completed on
    March 8, 2005, when all the entities, assets and
    liabilities that are included in these Consolidated and Combined
    Financial Statements as of March 8, 2005 were organized
    under one legal entity (as discussed below). The formation was
    accomplished through the contribution of entities and operating
    assets and liabilities to a newly formed subsidiary of Fidelity
    National Financial, Inc. (“FNF”). The Consolidated and
    Combined Financial Statements included herein reflect the
    historical financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows of the businesses included in the formation. On
    February 1, 2006, the Company completed a merger with
    Certegy Inc. (“Certegy”) (the “Certegy
    Merger”) (note 5) which was accounted for as a
    reverse acquisition and purchase accounting was applied to the
    acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Certegy. In form,
    Certegy was the legal acquirer in the Certegy Merger and the
    continuing registrant for SEC reporting purposes. However, due
    to the majority ownership in the combined entity held by FIS
    shareholders, FIS was designated the acquirer for accounting
    purposes and, effective on the Certegy Merger date, the
    historical financial statements of FIS became the historical
    financial statements of the continuing registrant for all
    periods prior to the Certegy Merger. The results of operations
    of Certegy are only included in these historical financial
    statements for periods subsequent to the Certegy Merger.
    Immediately after the Certegy Merger, the name of the SEC
    registrant was changed to Fidelity National Information
    Services, Inc.

As a result of the Certegy Merger, each outstanding share of FIS
    common stock was exchanged for 0.6396 shares of common
    stock of Certegy, which has a par value of $0.01 per share.
    All share and per share amounts disclosed in these financial
    statements and footnotes for periods prior to February 1,
    2006 are presented as converted by the exchange ratio used in
    the Certegy Merger.

Shortly after consummating the Certegy Merger, the Company
    implemented a new organizational structure, which resulted in
    the formation of new operating segments beginning with the
    reporting of results for the first quarter of 2006
    (note 18). Effective as of February 1, 2006, the
    Company’s reportable segments are Transaction Processing
    Services, or TPS, and Lender Processing Services, or LPS. This
    structure reflects how the businesses are managed consistent
    with the new operating structure adopted following the Certegy
    Merger. The primary components of the TPS segment are
    Certegy’s former reportable segments of Card and Check
    Services and the financial institution processing businesses of
    FIS’s former Financial Institution Software and Services
    segment (Enterprise Solutions, Integrated Financial Solutions,
    and International operations). The primary components of the LPS
    segment are Mortgage Processing and Information Services, which
    includes the mortgage lender processing component of FIS’s
    former Financial Institution Software and Services segment, and
    FIS’s former Lender Services, Default Management, and
    Information Services segments.

(2)

Combination
    with FNF

On June 25, 2006, the Company entered into an agreement and
    plan of merger (the “FNF Merger Agreement”) with FNF
    (amended September 18, 2006) (the FNF Merger). The FNF
    Merger was one step in a plan that eliminated FNF’s holding
    company structure and majority ownership of FIS. In connection
    with this plan, FNF also entered into a securities exchange and
    distribution agreement (the “SEDA”) with its
    subsidiary Fidelity National Title Group, Inc.
    (“FNT”). Under the SEDA, FNF agreed that, prior to the
    merger, FNF would transfer substantially all its assets and
    liabilities to FNT, in exchange for shares of FNT common stock.
    FNF then would spin-off all shares of FNT stock it held to the
    stockholders of FNF in a tax-free distribution. Pursuant to the
    FNF Merger Agreement, on November 9, 2006 FNF merged with
    and into FIS, with FIS continuing as the surviving corporation.
    In consideration for the FNF Merger, FNF stockholders received
    an aggregate of 96,521,877 shares of FIS stock for their
    FNF shares. In addition, in connection with the FNF Merger FIS
    issued options to purchase FIS common stock and shares of FIS
    restricted stock in exchange for FNF options and restricted
    stock outstanding at the time of the

    NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AND
    AFFILIATES

CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

FNF Merger. The FNF Merger followed the completion on
    October 24, 2006, of FNT’s acquisition under the SEDA
    of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of FNF (other
    than FNF’s interests in FIS and in FNF Capital Leasing,
    Inc., a small subsidiary which merged into FIS in a separate
    transaction) in exchange for 45,265,956 shares of
    FNT’s Class A common stock and the subsequent spin-off
    of FNT shares (the FNT Distribution”). Pursuant to the SEDA
    and after the completion of all of the transactions, FNT was
    renamed Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (“New FNF”)
    and now trades under the symbol FNF. Former FNF Chairman and CEO
    William P. Foley, II, assumed a similar position in New FNF
    and now serves as Executive Chairman of FIS, and other key
    members of FNF senior management continued their involvement in
    both New FNF and FIS in executive capacities.

U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that
    one of the two parties to the FNF Merger be designated as the
    acquirer for accounting purposes. However, Financial Accounting
    Standards Board Technical

Bulletin 85-5,

“Issues Relating to Accounting for Business
    Combinations” provides that if a transaction lacks
    substance, it is not a purchase event and should be accounted
    for based on existing carrying amounts. In the FNF Merger, the
    minority interest of FIS has not changed and the only assets and
    liabilities of the combined entity after the exchange are those
    of FIS prior to the exchange. Because a change in ownership of
    the minority interest did not take place, the exchange has been
    accounted for based on the carrying amounts of FIS’s assets
    and liabilities.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

The following describes the significant accounting policies of
    the Company which have been followed in preparing the
    accompanying Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.

(a)

Principles
    of Consolidation and Combination and Basis of
    Presentation

Prior to March 9, 2005, the historical financial statements
    of the Company were presented on a combined basis. Beginning
    March 9, 2005, after all the assets and liabilities of the
    Company were formally contributed to the holding company, the
    historical financial statements of the Company have been
    presented on a consolidated basis for financial reporting
    purposes. The accompanying Consolidated and Combined Financial
    Statements include those assets, liabilities, revenues, and
    expenses directly attributable to FIS’s operations and,
    prior to March 9, 2005, allocations of certain FNF
    corporate assets, liabilities, and expenses to FIS.

All significant intercompany profits, transactions and balances
    have been eliminated in consolidation or combination. The
    financial information included herein does not necessarily
    reflect what the financial position and results of operations of
    the Company would have been had it operated as a stand-alone
    entity during the periods covered.

The Company’s investments in less than 50% owned
    partnerships and affiliates are accounted for using the equity
    method of accounting.

All dollar amounts presented in these notes and in the
    accompanying Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements
    (except per share amounts) are in thousands unless indicated
    otherwise.

(b)

Transactions
    with Related Parties

FIS has historically conducted business with FNF and its
    subsidiaries. In March 2005, in connection with the
    recapitalization and sale of equity interest (note 4), FIS
    entered into various agreements with FNF under which it has
    continued to provide title agency services, title plant
    management, and IT services. Further, the Company also entered
    into service agreements with FNF under which FNF continued to
    provide corporate services. In September 2005, when FNT was
    formed and the title insurance business was consolidated under
    FNT, many of these agreements were amended and restated to take
    into account the services that would be performed for and by FNT
    rather than FNF. On February 1, 2006, in connection with
    the closing of the Certegy Merger, many of these agreements were
    further amended and restated to reflect changes in the
    parties’ relationships. Certain of these



FIDELITY
    NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AND
    AFFILIATES

CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

agreements were further amended or terminated in connection with
    the FNF Merger and related transactions. A summary of these
    agreements as in effect through December 31, 2006 is as
    follows:

•

Agreement to provide data processing
    services.

This agreement governs the revenues to
    be earned by the Company for providing IT support services and
    software, primarily infrastructure support and data center
    management, to FNF and its subsidiaries. Subject to certain
    early termination provisions (including the payment of minimum
    monthly service and termination fees), this agreement has an
    initial term of five years from February 2006 with an option to
    renew for one or two additional years.

•

Agreements to provide title plant information, maintenance
    and management.

These agreements govern the fee
    structure under which the Company is paid for maintaining,
    managing and updating title plants owned by FNF’s title
    underwriters in certain parts of the country. The title plant
    maintenance agreement requires, among other things, that the
    Company gather updated property information, organize it, input
    it into one of several systems, maintain or obtain the use of
    necessary software and hardware to store, access and deliver the
    data, sell and deliver the data to customers and provide various
    forms of customer support. The Company sells property
    information to title underwriters which are subsidiaries of FNF
    as well as to various unaffiliated customers. The Company pays
    FNF a royalty fee of 2.5% to 3.75% of the revenues received. In
    the case of the maintenance agreement, the Company is
    responsible for the costs of keeping the title plant assets
    current and functioning and in return receives the revenue
    generated by those assets. Subject to certain early termination
    provisions for cause, each of these agreements may be terminated
    upon five years’ prior written notice, which notice may not
    be given until after the fifth anniversary of the effective date
    of the agreement in May 2005 (thus effectively resulting in a
    minimum ten year term and a rolling one-year term thereafter).

•

Agreements to provide software development and
    services.

These agreements govern the fee
    structure under which the Company is paid for providing software
    development and services to FNF which consist of developing
    software for use in the title operations of FNF.

•

Arrangements to provide other real estate related
    services.

Under these arrangements the Company is
    paid for providing other real estate related services to FNF,
    which consist primarily of data services required by the title
    insurance operations.

•

Agreements by FNF to provide corporate services to the
    Company.

These agreements provide for FNF to
    provide general management, accounting, treasury, tax, finance,
    legal, payroll, human resources, employee benefits, internal
    audit, mergers and acquisitions, and other corporate and
    administrative support to the Company. The pricing of these
    services is at cost for services which are either directly
    attributable to the Company, or in certain circumstances, an
    allocation of the Company’s share of the total costs
    incurred by FNF in providing such services based on estimates
    that FNF and the Company believe to be reasonable.

•

Licensing, leasing and cost sharing
    agreements.

These agreements provide for the
    reimbursement of certain amounts from FNF or its subsidiaries
    related to various miscellaneous licensing, leasing, and cost
    sharing agreements, as well as the payment of certain amounts by
    the Company to FNF or its subsidiaries in connection with the
    Company’s use of certain intellectual property or other
    assets of or services by FNF.

•

Agreements to provide title agency
    services.

These agreements allow the Company to
    provide services to existing customers through loan facilitation
    transactions, primarily with large national lenders. The
    arrangement involves the Company providing title agency services
    which result in the issuance of title policies by the Company on
    behalf of title insurance underwriters owned by FNF and
    subsidiaries. Subject to certain early termination provisions
    for cause, each of these agreements may be terminated upon five
    years’ prior written notice, which notice may not be given
    until after the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the
    agreement ranging from July 2004 through September 2006 for
    various agreements (thus effectively resulting in a minimum ten
    year term and a rolling one-year term thereafter). The LPS
    segment includes

revenues from unaffiliated third parties of $83.9 million,
    $80.9 million and $92.2 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
    representing commissions on title insurance policies written by
    the Company on behalf of title insurance subsidiaries of FNF.
    These commissions are equal to 88% of the total title premium
    from title policies that the Company places with subsidiaries of
    FNF. The Company also performs similar functions in connection
    with trustee sale guarantees, a form of title insurance that
    subsidiaries of FNF issue as part of the foreclosure process on
    a defaulted loan.

The Company believes the amounts earned from or charged by FNF
    to the Company under each of the foregoing service arrangements
    are fair and reasonable. Although the 88% commission rate on
    title insurance policies was set without negotiation, the
    Company believes it is consistent with the blended rate that
    would be available to a third party title agent given the amount
    and the geographic distribution of the business produced and the
    low risk of loss profile of the business placed. In connection
    with title plant management, the Company charges FNF title
    insurers for title information at approximately the same rates
    the Company and other similar vendors charge unaffiliated title
    insurers. The Company’s IT infrastructure support and data
    center management services to FNF are priced within the range of
    prices the Company offers to third parties.

The Company also provides data processing services to Sedgwick
    CMS, a Company in which FNF has held an approximately 40% equity
    interest since February 1, 2006. The Company recorded
    $17.3 million in revenue relating to this arrangement with
    Sedgwick in 2006.

Other transactions with FNF:

Contribution of National New York

During the second quarter of 2006, FNF contributed the stock of
    National Title Insurance of New York, Inc. (“National
    New York”), a title insurance company, to the Company, in
    connection with the recapitalization transaction in March 2005.
    This transaction was reflected as a contribution of capital from
    FNF in the amount of FNF’s historical basis in National New
    York of approximately $10.7 million.

Merger with FNF Capital

On October 26, 2006, the Company completed a merger with
    FNF Capital, Inc. (“FNF Capital”) a leasing subsidiary
    of FNF. The Company issued 279,000 shares of the
    Company’s common stock to FNF in exchange for a

majority ownership in FNF Capital. The transaction was recorded
    at FNF’s historical basis in FNF Capital of approximately
    $2.3 million and the Company purchased the minority
    ownership shortly thereafter for $3.8 million in cash.

The contribution of National New York and the merger with FNF
    Capital were completed between entities under common control and
    their results of operations and account balances have been
    included in the Company’s results of operations and
    statement of financial position since the date of the relevant
    transactions. Had the Company included the results of operations
    and balance sheets for all periods presented in these Combined
    and Consolidated Financial Statements, net earnings would have
    been adjusted $0.5 million, $(0.2) million and
    $(0.7) million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively and
    total assets would have increased $82.2 million as of
    December 31, 2005.

Investment by FNF in Fidelity National Real Estate Solutions,
    Inc.

On December 31, 2006, FNF contributed $52.5 million to
    Fidelity National Real Estate Solutions,
    Inc.(“FNRES”), a subsidiary of the Company, for
    approximately 61% of the outstanding shares of FNRES. As a
    result, as of December 31, 2006, the Company no longer
    consolidates FNRES, but records its remaining 39% interest as an
    equity investment in the amount of $33.5 million. The
    results of FNRES are included in the Consolidated and Combined
    Statement of earnings for all periods presented.

Transactions
    with Covansys

The Company also entered into a master service provider
    agreement with Covansys, an entity in which the Company holds a
    29% equity interest, which requires the Company to purchase a
    minimum of $150 million in services over a five year period
    expiring June 30, 2009 or be subject to certain penalties
    if defined spending thresholds are not met. The Company does not
    believe any future penalties will be incurred under the
    agreement. During 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company spent
    $35.7 million, $17.6 million and $5.0 million
    purchasing professional services from Covansys and its
    subsidiaries.

Transactions with Banco Bradesco S.A. and ABN AMRO Real

In 2006, the Company recorded revenues of $22.8 million
    from ABN AMRO Real and $20.4 million from Banco Bradesco
    which are venture partners in the Company’s Brazilian card
    business.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of reporting cash flows, highly liquid instruments
    purchased with original maturities of three months or less are
    considered cash equivalents. The carrying amounts reported in
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets for these instruments
    approximate their fair value.

(d)

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The fair values of financial instruments, which include trade
    receivables and long-term debt, approximate their carrying
    values. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve
    uncertainties and significant judgment in the interpretation of
    current market data. Therefore, the values presented are not
    necessarily indicative of amounts the Company could realize or
    settle currently. The Company holds, or has held, certain
    derivative instruments, specifically interest rate swaps,
    warrants and several put and call options relating to certain
    majority-owned subsidiaries (note 3(e)).

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”

,

(“SFAS No. 133”) as amended. During 2005
    and 2006, the Company engaged in hedging activities relating to
    its variable rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps.
    The Company designates these interest rate swaps as cash flow
    hedges. The estimated fair values of the cash flow hedges are
    recorded as an asset or liability of the Company and are
    included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in
    other non-current assets and or other long term liabilities, as
    appropriate, and as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive earnings, net of deferred taxes. A portion of the
    amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is
    recorded as interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest
    payments are made on the term loan. The Company’s existing
    cash flow hedges are highly effective and there is no current
    impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. It is the
    policy of the Company to execute such instruments with
    credit-worthy banks and not to enter into derivative financial
    instruments for speculative purposes.

The Company also owns warrants to purchase additional shares of
    common stock of Covansys Corporation. From September 2004 (the
    date of initial purchase of Covansys stock and warrants) until
    March 25, 2005, the Company accounted for the warrants
    under SFAS No. 133. Under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 133, the warrants were considered derivative
    instruments and were recorded at a fair value of approximately
    $23.5 million on the date of acquisition. During the first
    quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a loss of
    $4.4 million on the decrease in fair value of the warrants
    through March 25, 2005 which is reflected in the
    Consolidated and Combined Statement of Earnings in other income
    and expense. On March 25, 2005, the terms of the warrants
    were amended to add a mandatory holding period subsequent to
    exercise of the warrants and eliminate a cashless exercise
    option available to the Company such that the accounting for the
    investment in the warrants is now governed by the provisions of
    SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments
    in Debt and Equity Securities”

,

and changes in the
    fair value of the warrants are recorded in other comprehensive
    earnings. The fair value of the Company’s investment in
    Covansys warrants at December 31, 2006 and 2005 is
    $46.3 million and $29.5 million, respectively.

Settlement Deposits, Receivables, and
    Payables.

The Company records settlement
    receivables and payables that result from timing differences in
    the Company’s settlement process with merchants, financial
    institutions, and credit card associations related to merchant
    and card transaction processing and third-party check
    collections. Cash held by FIS associated with this settlement
    process is classified as settlement deposits in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets.

The Company had a $100 million unsecured revolving credit
    facility that it used to finance its customers’ shortfalls
    in the daily funding requirements associated with the
    Company’s credit and debit card settlement operations (the
    “Settlement Facility”). Amounts borrowed were
    typically repaid within one to two business days, as customers
    funded the shortfalls. This facility had a term of 364 days
    and was renewed annually. There were no amounts outstanding
    under this facility at December 31, 2006. The Settlement
    Facility was terminated on January 18, 2007.

Other
    receivables

Other receivables represent amounts due from consumers related
    to deferred debit processing services offered in Australia and
    the U.K., amounts due from financial institutions for the

facilitation business, certain lease receivables and income
    taxes receivable. The carrying value for these receivables
    approximates their fair value.

(h)

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of
    identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
    business combinations. SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets” (“SFAS No. 142”)
    requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be
    amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their
    estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in
    accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
    (“SFAS No. 144”). SFAS No 142 and
    SFAS No. 144 also provide that goodwill and other
    intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be
    amortized, but shall be tested for impairment annually or more
    frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment,
    through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount. The
    Company measures for impairment on an annual basis during the
    fourth quarter using a September 30th measurement date
    unless circumstances require a more frequent measurement.

(i)

Long-lived
    Assets

SFAS No. 144 requires that long-lived assets and
    intangible assets with definite useful lives be reviewed for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
    Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by
    comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated
    undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the
    asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated
    future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the
    amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the
    fair value of the asset.

(j)

Intangible
    Assets

The Company has intangible assets which consist primarily of
    customer relationships that are recorded in connection with
    acquisitions at their fair value based on the results of
    valuations by third parties. Customer relationships are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated
    method which takes into consideration expected customer
    attrition rates up to a ten-year period. Intangible assets with
    estimated useful lives are reviewed for impairment in accordance
    with SFAS No. 144 while intangible assets that are
    determined to have indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment
    at least annually in accordance with SFAS No. 142.

(k)

Computer
    Software

Computer software includes the fair value of software acquired
    in business combinations, purchased software and capitalized
    software development costs. Purchased software is recorded at
    cost and amortized using the straight-line method over its
    estimated useful life and software acquired in business
    combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using
    straight-line or accelerated methods over its estimated useful
    life, ranging from five to ten years.

Capitalized software development costs are accounted for in
    accordance with either SFAS No. 86, “Accounting
    for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or
    Otherwise Marketed” (“SFAS No. 86”), or
    with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
    (“AICPA”) Statement of Position (“SOP”)

No. 98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use”

(“SOP 98-1”).

After the technological feasibility of the software has been
    established (for SFAS No. 86 software), or at the
    beginning of application development (for

SOP No. 98-1

software), software development costs, which include salaries
    and related payroll costs and costs of independent contractors
    incurred during development, are capitalized. Research and
    development costs incurred prior to the establishment of
    technological feasibility (for SFAS No. 86 software),
    or prior to application development (for

SOP No. 98-1

software), are expensed as incurred. Software development costs
    are amortized on a

product-by-product

basis commencing on the date of general release of the products
    (for

SFAS No. 86 software) and the date placed in service
    for purchased software (for

SOP No. 98-1

software). Software development costs (for SFAS No. 86
    software) are amortized using the greater of (1) the
    straight-line method over its estimated useful life, which
    ranges from three to ten years or (2) the ratio of current
    revenues to total anticipated revenue over its useful life.

(l)

Deferred
    Contract Costs

Cost of software sales and outsourced data processing and
    application management arrangements, including costs incurred
    for bid and proposal activities, are generally expensed as
    incurred. However, certain costs incurred upon initiation of a
    contract are deferred and expensed over the contract life. These
    costs represent incremental external costs or certain specific
    internal costs that are directly related to the contract
    acquisition or transition activities and are primarily
    associated with installation of systems/processes and data
    conversion.

In the event indications exist that a deferred contract cost
    balance related to a particular contract may be impaired,
    undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected
    over its remaining term and compared to the unamortized deferred
    contract cost balance. If the projected cash flows are not
    adequate to recover the unamortized cost balance, the balance
    would be adjusted to equal the contract’s net realizable
    value, including any termination fees provided for under the
    contract, in the period such a determination is made.

(m)

Property
    and Equipment

Property and equipment is recorded at cost, less accumulated
    depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are
    computed primarily using the straight-line method based on the
    estimated useful lives of the related assets: thirty years for
    buildings and three to seven years for furniture, fixtures and
    computer equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized using
    the straight-line method over the lesser of the initial term of
    the applicable lease or the estimated useful lives of such
    assets.

(n)

Income
    Taxes

Through March 8, 2005, the Company’s operating results
    were included in FNF’s Consolidated U.S. Federal and
    State income tax returns. The provision for income taxes in the
    Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings is made at
    rates consistent with what the Company would have paid as a
    stand-alone taxable entity in those periods. Beginning on
    March 9, 2005, the Company became its own tax paying
    entity. The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities for temporary differences between the financial
    reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company’s assets
    and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating
    loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The impact
    on deferred income taxes of changes in tax rates and laws, if
    any, is reflected in the Consolidated and Combined Financial
    Statements in the period enacted.

(o)

Revenue
    Recognition

The following describes the Company’s primary types of
    revenues and its revenue recognition policies as they pertain to
    the types of transactions the Company enters into with its
    customers. The Company enters into arrangements with customers
    to provide services, software and software related services such
    as post-contract customer support and implementation and
    training either individually or as part of an integrated
    offering of multiple products and services. These products and
    services occasionally include offerings from more than one
    segment to the same customer. The revenues for services provided
    under these multiple element arrangements are recognized in
    accordance with the applicable revenue recognition accounting
    principles as further described below.

    NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AND
    AFFILIATES

CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In its TPS business, the Company recognizes revenues relating to
    bank processing and credit and debit card processing services
    along with software licensing and software related services.
    Several of the Company’s contracts include a software
    license and one or more of the following services: data
    processing, development, implementation, conversion, training,
    programming, post-contract customer support and application
    management. In some cases, these services are offered in
    combination with one another and in other cases the Company
    offers them individually. Revenues from processing services are
    typically volume-based depending on factors such as the number
    of accounts processed, transactions processed and computer
    resources utilized.

The substantial majority of the revenues in the TPS business are
    from outsourced data processing, credit and debit card
    processing, and application management arrangements. Revenues
    from these arrangements are recognized as services are performed
    in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104
    (“SAB No. 104”), “Revenue
    Recognition” and related interpretations.
    SAB No. 104 sets forth guidance as to when revenue is
    realized or realizable and earned when all of the following
    criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been
    rendered; (3) the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed
    and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably
    assured. Revenues and costs related to implementation,
    conversion and programming services associated with the
    Company’s data processing and application management
    agreements during the implementation phase are deferred and
    subsequently recognized using the straight-line method over the
    term of the related services agreement. The Company evaluates
    these deferred contract costs for impairment in the event any
    indications of impairment exist. A relatively small percentage
    of credit card processing revenue is generated from the merchant
    institution processing business, where the relationship is with
    the financial institution that contracts directly with the
    merchant. In this business, the Company is responsible for
    collecting and settling interchange fees with the credit card
    associations, thus interchange fees are included as a component
    of revenue and costs of revenue.

In the event that the Company’s arrangements with its
    customers include more than one product or service, the Company
    determines whether the individual revenue elements can be
    recognized separately in accordance with Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) Emerging Issues Task Force

No. 00-21

(“EITF

00-21”),

“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables”.
    EITF

00-21

addresses the determination of whether an arrangement involving
    more than one deliverable contains more than one unit of
    accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be
    measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting.

If the products and services are software related products and
    services as determined under AICPA’s

SOP 97-2

“Software Revenue Recognition”

(“SOP 97-2”),

and

SOP 98-9

“Modification of

SOP No. 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain
    Transactions”

(“SOP 98-9”)

the Company applies these pronouncements and related
    interpretations to determine the appropriate units of accounting
    and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and
    allocated to the separate units.

The Company recognizes software license and post-contract
    customer support fees as well as associated development,
    implementation, training, conversion and programming fees in
    accordance with

SOP No. 97-2

and

SOP No. 98-9.

Initial license fees are recognized when a contract exists, the
    fee is fixed or determinable, software delivery has occurred and
    collection of the receivable is deemed probable, provided that
    vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) has been
    established for each element or for any undelivered elements.
    The Company determines the fair value of each element or the
    undelivered elements in multi-element software arrangements
    based on VSOE. If the arrangement is subject to accounting under

SOP No. 97-2,

VSOE for each element is based on the price charged when the
    same element is sold separately, or in the case of post-contract
    customer support, when a stated renewal rate is provided to the
    customer. If evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements
    exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered
    elements, then revenue is recognized using the residual method.
    Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered
    elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the
    arrangement fee is recognized as revenue. If evidence of fair
    value does not exist for one or more undelivered elements of a
    contract, then all revenue is deferred until all elements are
    delivered or fair value is determined for all

remaining undelivered elements. Revenue from post-contract
    customer support is recognized ratably over the term of the
    agreement. The Company records deferred revenue for all billings
    invoiced prior to revenue recognition.

With respect to a small percentage of revenues, the Company uses
    contract accounting, as required by

SOP No. 97-2,

when the arrangement with the customer includes significant
    customization, modification, or production of software. For
    elements accounted for under contract accounting, revenue is
    recognized in accordance with

SOP 81-1,

“Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and
    Certain Production-Type Contracts”

,

using the

percentage-of-completion

method since reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and
    contract hours applicable to various elements of a contract can
    be made. Revenues in excess of billings on these agreements are
    recorded as unbilled receivables and are included in trade
    receivables. Billings in excess of revenue recognized on these
    agreements are recorded as deferred revenue until revenue
    recognition criteria are met. Changes in estimates for revenues,
    costs and profits are recognized in the period in which they are
    determinable. When the Company’s estimates indicate that
    the entire contract will be performed at a loss, a provision for
    the entire loss is recorded in that accounting period.

In its LPS business, the Company recognizes revenues relating to
    mortgage processing services, loan facilitation services,
    default management services, and property data-related services.
    Mortgage processing arrangements are typically volume-based
    depending on factors such as the number of accounts processed,
    transactions processed and computer resources utilized. Revenue
    derived from software and service arrangements included in the
    lender processing services segment is recognized in accordance
    with

SOP No. 97-2

as discussed above. Loan facilitation services primarily consist
    of centralized title agency and closing services for various
    types of lenders. Revenues relating to loan facilitation
    services are typically recognized at the time of closing of the
    related real estate transaction. Ancillary service fees are
    recognized when the service is provided. Default management
    services assist customers through the default and foreclosure
    process, including property preservation and maintenance
    services (such as lock changes, window replacement, debris
    removal and lawn service), posting and publication of
    foreclosure and auction notices, title searches, document
    preparation and recording services, and referrals for legal and
    property brokerage services. Property data or data-related
    services principally include appraisal and valuation services,
    property records information, real estate tax services and
    borrower credit and flood zone information. Revenues derived
    from these services are recognized as the services are performed
    in accordance with SAB No. 104 as described above.

In addition, the Company’s flood and tax units provide
    various services including

life-of-loan-monitoring

services. Revenue for

life-of-loan

services is deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated
    average life of the loan service period, which is determined
    based on the Company’s historical experience and industry
    data. The Company evaluates its historical experience on a
    periodic basis, and adjusts the estimated life of the loan
    service period prospectively.

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

Certain FIS employees are participants in the Fidelity National
    Information Services, Inc. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, which
    provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock
    options, restricted stock and other stock-based incentive awards
    to officers and key employees. Also, certain FIS employees are
    participants in FNF’s stock-based compensation plans.
    Through the acquisition of Certegy, the Company adopted the
    Certegy stock incentive plans, which also allow for the granting
    of stock-based awards. All of the outstanding awards as of
    January 31, 2006 under Certegy’s plans were vested
    prior to the Certegy Merger.

On November 9, 2006, as part of the closing of the FNF
    Merger, the Company assumed certain options and restricted stock
    grants that the Company’s employees and directors held
    under various FNF stock-based compensation plans. The Company
    assumed approximately 2.7 million options to replace
    4.9 million outstanding FNF options per the FNF Merger
    Agreement. The Company also assumed 0.1 million shares of
    restricted stock.

CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair
    value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R,
    “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”)
    effective January 1, 2006. Prior to January 1, 2006,
    the Company accounted for stock-based compensation using the
    fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
    (“SFAS No. 123”) which the Company adopted
    on January 1, 2003 under the prospective method as
    permitted by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
    Disclosure” (“SFAS No. 148”). Under the
    fair-value method, stock-based employee compensation cost was
    recognized from the beginning of 2003 as if the fair value
    method of accounting had been used to account for all employee
    awards granted, modified, or settled in years beginning after
    December 31, 2002. The Company has provided for stock
    compensation expense of $50.1 million, $20.4 million
    and $15.4 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
    which is included in selling, general, and administrative
    expense in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings.
    The year ended 2006 included stock compensation expense of
    $24.5 million relating to the FIS performance based options
    granted on March 9, 2005 for which the performance and
    market based criteria for vesting were met during the period and
    a $6.1 million charge relating to the acceleration of
    option vesting in connection with the FNF Merger. There was no
    material impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R as all
    options issued to the Company’s employees under FNF grants
    that had been accounted for under other methods were fully
    vested as of December 31, 2005. All grants of FIS options
    have been accounted for under fair value accounting under
    SFAS 123 or SFAS 123R.

The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings for
    the year ended December 31, 2005, and 2004 as if the
    Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 123 to all awards held by FIS employees,
    including those that were issued prior to the adoption of
    SFAS 123 (in thousands):

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The functional currency for the foreign operations of the
    Company is either the U.S. Dollar or the local currency.
    For foreign operations where the local currency is the
    functional currency, the translation of foreign currencies into
    U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using
    exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for
    revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange
    rate during the period. The gains and losses resulting from the
    translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive
    earnings (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity and are excluded from net earnings.
    Realized gains or losses resulting from other foreign currency
    transactions are included in other income (expense) and are
    insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005,
    and 2004.

Management
    Estimates

The preparation of these Consolidated and Combined Financial
    Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
    at the date of the Consolidated and Combined Financial
    Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
    during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from
    those estimates.

The Company recognizes a reserve for estimated losses related to
    its card issuing business based on historical experience and
    other relevant factors. The Company records estimates to accrue
    for losses resulting from transaction processing errors by
    utilizing a number of systems and procedures in order to
    minimize such transaction processing errors. Card processing
    loss reserves are primarily determined by performing a
    historical analysis of loss experience and considering other
    factors that could affect that experience in the future. Such
    factors include the general economy and the credit quality of
    customers. Once these factors are considered, the Company
    assesses the reserve adequacy by comparing the recorded reserve
    to the estimated amount based on an analysis of the current
    trend changes or specific anticipated future events. Any
    adjustments are charged to costs of services. These card
    processing loss reserve amounts are subject to risk that actual
    losses may be greater than estimates.

In the Company’s check guarantee business, if a guaranteed
    check presented to a merchant customer is dishonored by the
    check writer’s bank, the Company reimburses the merchant
    customer for the check’s face value and pursues collection
    of the amount from the delinquent check writer. Loss reserves
    and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by
    performing a historical analysis of our check loss and recovery
    experience and considering other factors that could affect that
    experience in the future. Such factors include the general
    economy, the overall industry mix of customer volumes,
    statistical analysis of check fraud trends within customer
    volumes, and the quality of returned checks. Once these factors
    are considered, the Company establishes a rate for check losses
    that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses by
    dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated recoveries
    that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the
    total amount of related check losses. These rates are then
    applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses,
    respectively, each month and charged to cost of revenue. The
    estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk
    that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than
    the Company’s estimates. The Company had accrued claims
    payable and accrued claims recoverable balances of
    $30.0 million and $39.4 million at December 31,
    2006 related to these estimations. In addition, the Company
    recorded check guarantee losses, net of anticipated recoveries
    excluding service fees, of $102.9 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006. The amounts paid to merchant
    customers, net of amounts recovered from check writers excluding
    service fees, was $107.9 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. As the check guarantee business was
    acquired as part of the Certegy Merger (see Note 5), there
    are no amounts related to this activity in the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Net
    Earnings per Share

The basic weighted average shares and common stock equivalents
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 only include the
    shares and options that were previously outstanding at Certegy
    from February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. If
    these shares and options had been outstanding for the entire
    twelve months of 2006, basic weighted average shares outstanding
    would have been approximately 191.3 million, common stock
    equivalents would have been 3.3 million and weighted
    average shares on a diluted basis would have been
    194.6 million.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Post Retirement Plans” (“SFAS 158”).
    SFAS 158 requires entities to recognize on their balance
    sheets the funded status of pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans. Entities are required to recognize actuarial
    gains and losses, prior service cost, and any remaining
    transition amounts from the initial application of
    SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Pensions,” and SFAS No. 106,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
    Other Than Pensions,” when recognizing a plan’s funded
    status, with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive
    income. SFAS 158 will not change the amounts recognized in
    the income statement as net periodic benefit cost. All of the
    requirements of SFAS 158 are effective as of
    December 31, 2006 for calendar-year public companies,
    except for a requirement for

fiscal-year-end

measurements of plan assets and benefit obligations with which
    the Company is already in compliance. Adoption of this standard
    resulted in the Company recording a $6.9 million pre-tax
    adjustment to other long-term liabilities and other
    comprehensive income.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
    issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (Topic 1N),
    “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements” (SAB 108). This SAB addresses how the
    effects of prior-year uncorrected misstatements should be
    considered when quantifying misstatements in current-year
    financial statements. SAB 108 requires registrants to
    quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income
    statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach
    results in quantifying an error that is material in light of
    relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. When the effect
    of initial adoption is determined to be material, the SAB allows
    registrants to record that effect as a cumulative effect
    adjustment to

beginning-of-year

retained earnings. SAB 108 is effective for annual
    financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after
    November 15, 2006. Adoption of this standard had no effect
    on the Company’s statements of financial position and
    operations.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
    FASB Interpretation Number 48 (FIN 48),
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”.
    FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006. The interpretation clarifies the
    accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the
    financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
    Accounting for Income Taxes. The interpretation outlines
    recognition thresholds and measurement attributes to determine
    the amount, if any, of a tax benefit to be recognized in an
    enterprise’s financial statements. The Interpretation also
    provides guidance on subsequent recognition, de-recognition,
    measurement, recognition of interest and penalties,
    classification and disclosure. The company has reviewed
    FIN 48 and has determined that its implementation will not
    have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 123R
    (“SFAS No. 123R”), “Share-Based
    Payment,” which requires that compensation cost relating to
    share-based payments be recognized in the financial statements.
    During 2003, FIS adopted the fair value recognition provision of
    SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based

Compensation” (“SFAS No. 123”), for
    stock-based employee compensation, effective as of the beginning
    of 2003. FIS had elected to use the prospective method of
    transition, as permitted by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
    Disclosure” (“SFAS No. 148”). Under
    this method, stock-based employee compensation cost was
    recognized from the beginning of 2003 as if the fair value
    method of accounting had been used to account for all employee
    awards granted, modified, or settled in years beginning after
    December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 123R does not allow
    for the prospective method, but requires the recording of
    expense relating to the vesting of all unvested options
    beginning in the first quarter of 2006. Since
    SFAS No. 123 was adopted in 2003, the impact of
    recording additional expense in 2006 under
    SFAS No. 123R relating to options granted prior to
    January 1, 2003 is not significant as all options accounted
    for under other methods were fully vested as of
    December 31, 2005.

Certain
    Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made in the 2005 and 2004
    Consolidated Financial Statements to conform to the
    classifications used in 2006.

(4)  Recapitalization
    of FIS and Sale of Equity Interest

On March 9, 2005, the recapitalization of FIS was completed
    through $2.8 billion in borrowings under new senior credit
    facilities consisting of an $800 million Term Loan A
    facility, a $2.0 billion Term Loan B facility
    (collectively, the “Term Loan Facilities”) and a
    $400 million revolving credit facility (the
    “Revolver”). The Company fully drew upon the entire
    $2.8 billion in Term Loan Facilities to complete the
    recapitalization while the Revolver remained undrawn at the
    closing. Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Wachovia Bank,
    Deutsche Bank and Bear Stearns led a consortium of lenders which
    provided the new senior credit facilities.

Concurrently, FIS sold a 25 percent equity interest to an
    investment group led by Thomas H. Lee Partners (THL) and Texas
    Pacific Group (TPG). The Company issued a total of
    32 million shares of common stock of FIS (as converted for
    the Certegy Merger) to the investment group for a total purchase
    price of $500 million. A new Board of Directors was created
    at FIS, with William P. Foley, II, then current Chairman and
    Chief Executive Officer of FNF, serving as Chairman and Chief
    Executive Officer of FIS. FNF appointed four additional members
    to the FIS Board of Directors, while each of THL and TPG
    appointed two directors. On February 1, 2006 the Company
    completed its Certegy Merger and further changes were made to
    the Board of Directors and Lee Kennedy was appointed President
    and CEO of FIS (note 5). The following steps were
    undertaken to consummate the recapitalization plan and equity
    interest sale. On March 8, 2005, the Company declared and
    paid a $2.7 billion dividend to FNF in the form of a note.
    On March 9, 2005, the Company borrowed $2.8 billion
    under its new senior credit facilities and then paid FNF
    $2.7 billion, plus interest in repayment of the note. The
    equity interest sale was then closed through the payment of
    $500 million from the investment group led by THL and TPG
    to the Company. The Company then repaid approximately
    $410 million outstanding under its November 8, 2004
    credit facility. Finally, the Company paid all expenses related
    to the transactions. These expenses totaled $79.2 million,
    consisting of $33.5 million in financing fees and
    $45.7 million in fees relating to the equity interest sale,
    including placement fees payable to the investors.

(5)  Acquisitions

The results of operations and financial position of the entities
    acquired during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005,
    and 2004 are included in the Consolidated and Combined Financial
    Statements from and after the date of acquisition. The
    acquisitions prior to 2006 were made by the Company or FNF and
    then contributed to FIS by FNF. The acquisitions made by FNF and
    contributed to FIS are included in the related Consolidated and
    Combined Financial Statements as capital contributions. The
    purchase price of each acquisition was allocated to the assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed based on third party valuations
    with any excess cost over fair value being allocated to goodwill.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Certegy

On September 14, 2005, the Company entered into a
    definitive merger agreement with Certegy under which the Company
    and Certegy combined operations to form a single publicly traded
    company called Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.
    (NYSE:FIS). Certegy was a payment processing company
    headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida. On
    January 26, 2006, Certegy’s shareholders approved the
    Certegy Merger which was subsequently consummated on
    February 1, 2006.

Under the terms of the Certegy Merger agreement, the Company was
    merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of Certegy in a tax-free
    merger, and all of the Company’s outstanding stock was
    converted into Certegy common stock. As a result of the Certegy
    Merger:

•

The Company’s pre-merger shareholders owned approximately
    67.4% of the Company’s outstanding common stock immediately
    after the Certegy Merger, while Certegy’s pre-merger
    shareholders owned approximately 32.6%;

•

Immediately after the Certegy Merger, FNF and its subsidiaries
    owned approximately 51.0% of the Company’s outstanding
    common stock; and

•

The Company’s board of directors was reconstituted so that
    a majority of the board consisted of directors designated by the
    Company’s shareholders.

In connection with the Certegy Merger, Certegy amended its
    articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized
    shares of capital stock from 400 million shares to
    800 million shares, with 600 million shares being
    designated as common stock and 200 million shares being
    designated as preferred stock. Additionally, Certegy amended its
    stock incentive plan to increase the total number of shares of
    common stock available for issuance under the current stock
    incentive plan by an additional 6 million shares, and to
    increase the limits on the number of options, restricted shares,
    and other awards that may be granted to any individual in any
    calendar year. These changes were approved by Certegy’s
    shareholders on January 26, 2006.

As part of the Certegy Merger transaction, Certegy declared a
    $3.75 per share special cash dividend that was paid to
    Certegy’s pre-merger shareholders. This dividend, totaling
    $236.6 million, was paid by Certegy at the consummation of
    the Certegy Merger.

Generally accepted accounting principles in the
    U.S. require that one of the two companies in the
    transaction be designated as the acquirer for accounting
    purposes. The Company has been designated as the accounting
    acquirer because immediately after the Certegy Merger its
    shareholders held more than 50% of the common stock of the
    Company. As a result, the Certegy Merger has been accounted for
    as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of
    accounting. Under this accounting treatment, the Company is
    considered the acquiring entity and Certegy is considered the
    acquired entity for financial reporting purposes. The financial
    statements of the combined company after the Certegy Merger
    reflect the Company’s financial results on a historical
    basis and include the results of operations of Certegy from
    February 1, 2006.

The purchase price was based on the number of outstanding shares
    of common stock of Certegy on February 1, 2006, the date of
    consummation of the Certegy Merger, valued at $33.38 per
    share (which was the average of the trading price of Certegy
    common stock two days before and two days after the announcement
    of the Certegy Merger on September 15, 2005 of $37.13, less
    the $3.75 per share special dividend declared prior to
    closing). The purchase price also included the estimated fair
    value of Certegy’s stock options and restricted stock units
    outstanding at the transaction date.

    assumed liabilities which resulted in a net adjustment to

In connection with the Certegy Merger, the Company announced

    U.S. Retirement Income Plan (pension plan). The estimated
    impact of this settlement was reflected in the purchase price
    allocation as an increase in the pension liability, less the
    fair value of the pension plan assets, based on estimates of the
    total cost to settle the liability through the purchase of
    annuity contracts or lump sum settlements to the beneficiaries.
    The final settlement will not occur until after an IRS
    determination has been obtained, which is expected to be
    received in 2007. In addition to the pension plan obligation,
    the Company assumed liabilities for Certegy’s Supplemental
    Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) and Postretirement
    Benefit Plan. The total liability

recorded as part of the purchase price allocation related to all
    three plans, net of the fair value of plan related assets, was
    $32.6 million.

The Company has evaluated the various lease agreements, vendor
    arrangements, and customer contracts of Certegy. This evaluation
    has resulted in the recognition of certain liabilities
    associated with exiting activities of the acquired company.

Also, the Certegy Merger triggered the performance criteria
    relating to FIS’s performance stock option grant made in
    March 2005 and these awards vested when the trading value of the
    Company’s stock remained above $31.27 for 45 consecutive
    trading days following the Certegy Merger. As a result, the
    Company recorded a charge of $24.1 million in the first

    or Kordoba, a provider of core processing software and
    outsourcing solutions to the German banking market, from Siemens
    Business Services GmbH & Co. OHG (Siemens). The
    original purchase of 74.9% was completed September 30,
    2004. The total acquisition price was $163.2 million in
    cash (which includes $39.7 million for the subsequent
    purchase of the 25.1% minority interest). The Company recorded

On March 28, 2006, the Company signed a definitive
    agreement to form a venture with Banco Bradesco S.A. and Banco
    ABN AMRO Real to provide comprehensive, fully outsourced credit
    and prepaid card processing services to Brazilian card issuers.
    This venture will position the Company as the leading
    third-party card processor in Brazil. The Company will make
    investments of approximately $109 million through 2008,
    including $42 million in 2006, and will transfer ownership
    of its existing Brazilian card operation to the new venture.
    This venture is consolidated into the Company’s financial
    statements based on the Company’s controlling interest in
    the venture.

(6)  Investment
    in Covansys Corporation

On September 15, 2004, FNF acquired 11 million shares
    of common stock and warrants to purchase 4 million
    additional shares of Covansys Corporation (Covansys), a publicly
    traded U.S. based provider of application management and
    offshore outsourcing services with India based operations for
    $121.0 million in cash. FNF subsequently contributed the
    common stock and warrants to the Company which resulted in the
    Company owning approximately 29% of the common stock of
    Covansys. The Company accounts for the investment in common
    stock using the equity method of accounting and, until
    March 24, 2005, accounted for the warrants under
    SFAS No. 133. Under SFAS No. 133, the
    warrants were considered derivative instruments and were
    recorded at a fair value of approximately $23.5 million on
    the date of acquisition. On March 25, 2005, the terms of
    the warrants were amended to add a mandatory holding period
    subsequent to exercise of the warrants and eliminate a cashless
    exercise option available to the Company. Following these
    amendments, the accounting for the warrants is now governed by

    variable interest entity (the “VIE”), as landlord. The
    term of the Florida Lease expires on September 17, 2009,
    but can be renewed through September 17, 2014. In
    accordance with certain provisions of FASB Interpretation
    No. 46 (revised 2003),

    improvements related to the VIE which is included in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet was $28.2 million, net of
    accumulated depreciation.

On March 9, 2005, the Company entered into a Credit
    Agreement with Bank of America, as Administrative Agent and
    other financial institutions (the “BOA Credit
    Agreement”). The BOA Credit Agreement provided for an
    $800 million six-year term facility (“Term A
    Loans”), a $2.0 billion eight-year term facility
    (“Term B Loans”) (collectively the “Term
    Loan Facilities”) and a $400 million revolving
    credit facility (the “Revolver”) maturing on the sixth
    anniversary of the closing date. The Term Loan Facilities were
    fully drawn on the closing date while the Revolver was undrawn
    on the closing date. The Company had provided an unconditional
    guarantee of the full and punctual payment of the obligations
    under the BOA Credit Agreement and related loan documents.

The BOA Credit Agreement contained affirmative, negative,
    and financial covenants customary for financings of this type,
    including, among other things, limits on the creation of liens,
    limits on the incurrence of indebtedness, restrictions on
    investments and dispositions, limitations on dividends and other
    restricted payments and capital expenditures, a minimum interest
    coverage ratio, and a maximum secured leverage ratio. The
    Company’s management believes that the Company was in
    compliance with all covenants related to the BOA Credit
    Agreements at December 31, 2006.

In connection with the new Credit Agreement disclosed below, the
    Company terminated the Bank of America Term Loan and Revolver on
    January 18, 2007 and repaid it in full before its final
    scheduled expiration date of March 9, 2013. The final
    payment was approximately $2.64 billion, including
    principal, interest and fees. The Company incurred no early
    termination penalties in terminating the BOA Credit Agreement.

On January 18, 2007, the Company entered into a credit
    agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative
    Agent, Swing Line Lender, and L/C Issuer, Bank of America, N.A.,
    as Swing Line Lender, and other financial institutions party
    thereto (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement
    replaces the Bank of America Term Loan and Revolver as well as
    the $100 million Settlement Facility. The Credit Agreement,

unsecured, provides for a committed $2.1 billion five-year
    term facility denominated in U.S. Dollars (the “JPM
    Term Loan”) and a committed $900 million revolving
    credit facility (the “JPM Revolving Loan”) with a
    sublimit of $250 million for letters of credit and a
    sublimit of $250 million for swing line loans, maturing on
    the fifth anniversary of the closing date (the “Maturity
    Date”). The JPM Revolving Loan is bifurcated into a
    $735 million multicurrency revolving credit loan (the
    “Multicurrency Tranche”) that can be denominated in
    any combination of U.S. Dollars, Euro, British Pounds
    Sterling and Australian Dollars, and any other foreign currency
    in which the relevant lenders agree to make advances and a
    $165 million U.S. Dollar revolving credit loan that
    can be denominated only in U.S. Dollars. The swingline
    loans and letters of credit are available as a sublimit under
    the Multicurrency Tranche. In addition, the Credit Agreement
    provides for an uncommitted incremental loan facility in the
    uncommitted maximum principal amount of $600 million, which
    will be made available only upon receipt of further commitments
    from lenders under the Credit Agreement sufficient to fund the
    amount requested by the Company.

The JPM Term Loan was fully drawn on the closing date and a
    total of $557 million was borrowed under the JPM Revolving
    Loan on the closing date. The obligations under the Credit
    Agreement have been jointly and severally, unconditionally
    guaranteed by substantially all of the domestic subsidiaries of
    the Company.

The Company may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts under the
    JPM Revolving Loan from time to time until the maturity of the
    JPM Revolving Loan. The Company must make quarterly principal
    payments under the JPM Term Loan in scheduled installments of:
    (a) $13,125,000 per quarter from March 31, 2007
    through December 31, 2008; (b) $26,250,000 per
    quarter from March 31, 2009 through December 31, 2009;
    and (c) $52,500,000 per quarter from March 31,
    2010 through September 30, 2011, with the remaining balance
    of approximately $1,522,500,000 payable on the Maturity Date.

In addition to the scheduled principal payments, the JPM Term
    Loan is (with certain exceptions) subject to mandatory
    prepayment upon issuances of debt, casualty and condemnation
    events, and sales of assets. Voluntary prepayments of the Loans
    are generally permitted at any time without fee upon proper
    notice and subject to a minimum dollar requirement. Commitment
    reductions of the JPM Revolving Loan are also permitted at any
    time without fee upon proper notice. The JPM Revolving Loan has
    no scheduled principal payments, but it will be due and payable
    in full on the Maturity Date.

The outstanding balance of the Loans bear interest at a floating
    rate, which is at Company’s option, either (a) the
    eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin and mandatory cost
    or (b) a base rate plus an applicable margin. The
    applicable margin is subject to adjustment based on a leverage
    ratio (total indebtedness to EBITDA of the Company and its
    consolidated subsidiaries, as further defined in the Credit
    Agreement). Alternatively, the Company has the ability to
    request the lenders to submit competitive bids for one or more
    advances under the JPM Revolving Loan (“Bid Rate
    Advances”).

The Credit Agreement provides procedures for lenders to submit
    bids for Bid Rate Advances and for the Company to accept or
    reject them. The Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative
    and financial covenants customary for financings of this type,
    including, among other things, limits on the creation of liens,
    limits on the incurrence of indebtedness, restrictions on
    investments and dispositions, limitations on dividends and other
    restricted payments, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a
    maximum leverage ratio. Upon an event of default, the
    Administrative Agent can accelerate the maturity of the loan.
    Events of default include conditions customary for such an
    agreement, including failure to pay principal and interest in a

Through the Certegy Merger, the Company has an obligation to
    service $200 million (aggregate principal amount) of
    unsecured 4.75% fixed-rate notes due in 2008. The notes were
    recorded in purchase accounting at a discount of
    $5.7 million, which is being amortized over the term of the
    notes. The notes accrue interest at a rate of 4.75% per
    year, payable semi-annually in arrears on each March 15 and
    September 15.

On April 11, 2005, FIS entered into interest rate swap
    agreements which have effectively fixed the interest rate at
    approximately 5.4% through April 2008 on $350 million of
    the Term Loan Facilities (or its replacement debt) and at
    approximately 5.2% through April 2007 on an additional
    $350 million of the term loan. The Company has designated
    these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges in accordance with
    SFAS No. 133. The estimated fair value of the cash
    flow hedges results in an asset to the Company of
    $4.9 million and $5.2 million, as of December 31,
    2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, which is included
    in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in other
    noncurrent assets and as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive earnings, net of deferred taxes. A portion of the
    amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is
    reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment as
    interest payments are made on the Term Loan Facilities. The
    Company’s existing cash flow hedges are highly effective
    and there is no current impact on earnings due to hedge
    ineffectiveness. It is the policy of the Company to execute such
    instruments with credit-worthy banks and not to enter into
    derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Management believes that based on its historical pattern of
    taxable income, the Company will produce sufficient income in
    the future to realize its deferred income tax assets. A
    valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred
    income tax asset that management believes it is more likely than
    not that the Company will not be able to realize the benefits of
    such deferred income tax assets. Adjustments to the valuation
    allowance will be made if there is a change in management’s
    assessment of the amount of deferred income tax asset that is
    realizable.

At December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, the
    Company has federal net operating loss carryforwards of
    $45.6 million and $91.8 million, respectively which
    expire between 2019 and 2024. The Company also has foreign net
    operating losses in Canada, Brazil, Germany and the United
    Kingdom. The Company considers the need for a valuation
    allowance on a

country-by-country

basis taking into account the effects of local tax law.
    Management believes that there is sufficient evidence to support
    its conclusion not to record a valuation allowance for the net
    operating loss carryovers except for $15.5 million of
    Canadian net operating loss carryover which are not deemed
    realizable. The total Canadian net operating loss carryforwards
    as of December 31, 2006 are $20.5 million which will
    begin to expire in 2006 unless the Company is able to implement
    a tax planning strategy to utilize the net operating losses. As
    of December 31, 2006, the Company has a valuation allowance
    against $15.5 million of the Canadian net operating losses
    that Company’s management believes it is more likely than
    not that it will not realize any benefits. At December 31,
    2006 and December 31, 2005, the company had foreign tax
    credit carryovers of $12.3 million and $11 million,
    respectively, which expire between 2010 and 2025. As of
    December 31, 2006, the Company has a valuation allowance
    against $2.3 million of foreign tax credits that the
    Company’s management believes it is more likely than not
    that it will not realize the benefit.

As of January 1, 2005, the Internal Revenue Service
    selected the Company to participate in the Compliance Assurance
    Program (CAP) which is a real-time audit for 2005 and future
    years. The Internal Revenue Service has completed its review for
    years

2002-2005

which resulted in an immaterial adjustment for tax year 2004
    related to a temporary difference and no changes to any other
    tax year. Tax year 2006 is currently under audit by the IRS.
    Currently Management believes the ultimate resolution of the
    2006 examination will not result in a material adverse effect to
    the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

The Company provides for United States income taxes on earnings
    of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently
    reinvested outside the United States. At December 31, 2006,
    the cumulative earnings on which United States taxes have not
    been provided for were $90 million. If these earnings were
    repatriated to the United States, they would generate foreign
    tax credits that could reduce the federal tax liability
    associated with the foreign dividend.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
    FASB Interpretation Number 48 (FIN 48),
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”.
    FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006. The interpretation clarifies the
    accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the
    financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
    Accounting for Income Taxes. The interpretation outlines
    recognition thresholds and measurement attributes to determine
    the amount, if any, of a tax benefit to be recognized in an
    enterprise’s financial statements. The Interpretation also
    provides guidance on subsequent recognition, de-recognition,
    measurement, recognition of interest and penalties,
    classification and disclosure. The Company has reviewed
    FIN 48 and has determined that its implementation will not
    have a material impact on the Company’s financial
    statements.

    various pending and threatened litigation matters related to its

believes that no actions, other than the matters listed below,
    depart from customary litigation incidental to its business. As
    background to the disclosure below, please note the following:

•

These matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal
    issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities.

•

The Company reviews these matters on an on-going basis and
    follows the provisions of SFAS No. 5, “Accounting
    for Contingencies” when making accrual and disclosure
    decisions. When assessing reasonably possible and probable
    outcomes, the Company bases its decision on its assessment of
    the ultimate outcome following all appeals.

The Company and certain of its employees, were named on
    March 6, 2006 as defendants in a civil lawsuit brought by
    Grace & Digital Information Technology Co., Ltd.
    (“Grace”), a Chinese company that formerly acted as a
    sales agent for Alltel Information Services (“AIS”).

Grace originally filed a lawsuit in December 2004 in state court
    in Monterey County, California, alleging that the Company
    breached the sales agency agreement by failing to pay Grace
    commissions associated with sales contracts signed in 2001 and
    2003. The 2001 contracts were never completed. The 2003
    contracts, as to which Grace provided no assistance, were for a
    different project and were executed one and one-half years after
    Grace’s sales agency agreement was terminated. In addition
    to its breach of contract claim, Grace also alleged that the
    Company violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in its
    dealings with a bank customer in China. The Company denied
    Grace’s allegations in this California lawsuit.

In December 2005, the Monterey County court dismissed the
    lawsuit on the grounds of inconvenient forum, which decision
    Grace appealed on February 10, 2006. That appeal was
    subsequently dismissed voluntarily by Grace. On March 6,
    2006, Grace filed a new lawsuit in the United States District
    Court for the Middle District of Florida seeking the recovery of
    over $50 million in damages arising from the same
    transaction, and added an additional allegation to its complaint
    that the Company violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
    Organizations Act (RICO) in its dealings with the same bank
    customer. The Company intends to defend this case vigorously. On
    March 7, 2006, the Company filed its motion to dismiss this
    lawsuit, and on March 27, 2006, the Company filed an answer
    denying Grace’s underlying allegations and counterclaiming
    against Grace for tortious interference with contract and abuse
    of process. These motions have all been fully briefed and are
    pending before the Court. A pretrial management order has been
    entered providing for discovery, pretrial motion deadlines, and,
    if necessary, a trial in the later part of 2007.

The Company and its counsel have investigated these allegations
    and, based on the results of the investigations, do not believe
    that there have been any violations of the FCPA or RICO, or that
    the ultimate disposition of these allegations or the lawsuit
    will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The
    Company is fully cooperating with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with
    their inquiry into these allegations.

Indemnifications
    and Warranties

The Company often indemnifies its customers against damages and
    costs resulting from claims of patent, copyright, or trademark
    infringement associated with use of its software through
    software licensing agreements. Historically, the Company has not
    made any payments under such indemnifications, but continues to
    monitor the conditions that are subject to the indemnifications
    to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred, and
    would recognize any such losses when they are estimable. In
    addition, the Company warrants to customers that its software
    operates substantially in accordance with the software
    specifications. Historically, no costs have been incurred
    related to software warranties and none are expected in the
    future, and as such no accruals for warranty costs have been
    made.

CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As a condition to the FNT Distribution, FNF received a ruling
    from the Internal Revenue Service and an opinion from a
    nationally recognized accounting firm, together to the effect
    that the FNT Distribution would be tax free for both FNF and the
    stockholders of FNF under Section 355 and related
    provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The FNT Distribution
    would become taxable to FNF (and to the Company, its successor
    after the FNF merger) pursuant to Section 355(e) of the
    Internal Revenue Code if 50% or more of the shares of either FNF
    common stock (taking into account the Company’s common
    stock, as successor to FNF after the merger) or 50% or more of
    the FNT common stock were acquired, directly or indirectly, as
    part of a plan or series of related transactions that included
    the FNT Distribution. Because the FNF stockholders owned more
    than 50% of the Company’s common stock following the FNF
    Merger, the merger, standing alone, would not cause the
    distribution to be taxable to FNF under Section 355(e).
    However, if the Internal Revenue Service successfully asserted
    that acquisitions of FNF common stock or the Company’s
    common stock, either before or after the distribution, were part
    of a plan or series of related transactions that included the
    FNT Distribution, such determination likely would result in the
    recognition of gain by FNF under Section 355(e) taking into
    account that the merger resulted in an acquisition of
    approximately 49% of the stock of the Company pursuant to a plan
    that includes the FNT Distribution. Under tax disaffiliation
    agreements executed by the parties, FNT would generally be
    required to indemnify the Company (as successor to FNF after the
    merger) against tax-related losses to the Company that arise if
    the distribution were to become taxable under
    Section 355(e). However, the Company would be required to
    indemnify FNT if the Company had taken certain actions within
    its control that caused the FNT Distribution to be taxable. If
    Section 355(e) were to cause the FNT Distribution to be
    taxable to FNF and indemnifiable by FNT or the Company, the FNT
    Distribution would remain tax free to FNF’s stockholders,
    assuming the other requirements of Section 355 were
    otherwise satisfied.

Escrow
    Arrangements

In conducting its operations, the Company routinely holds
    customers’ assets in escrow, pending completion of real
    estate transactions. Certain of these amounts are maintained in
    segregated bank accounts and have not been included in the
    accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has a
    contingent liability relating to proper disposition of these
    balances, which amounted to $2.2 billion at
    December 31, 2006. As a result of holding these
    customers’ assets in escrow, the Company has ongoing
    programs for realizing economic benefits during the year through
    favorable borrowing and vendor arrangements with various banks.
    There were no investments or loans outstanding as of
    December 31, 2006 related to these arrangements.

Leases

The Company leases certain of its property under leases which
    expire at various dates. Several of these agreements include
    escalation clauses and provide for purchases and renewal options
    for periods ranging from one to five years.

Future minimum operating lease payments for leases with
    remaining terms greater than one year for each of the years in
    the five years ending December 31, 2011, and thereafter in

In addition, the Company has operating lease commitments
    relating to office equipment and computer hardware with annual
    lease payments of approximately $16 million per year which
    renew on a short-term basis.

Rent expense incurred under all operating leases during the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was
    $81.5 million, $61.1 million and $52.6 million,
    respectively.

Data Processing Services Agreements.

The
    Company, through the Certegy Merger (note 5), has
    agreements with IBM and Proceda, which expire between 2007 and
    2017, for portions of its computer data processing operations
    and related functions. The Company’s estimated aggregate
    contractual obligation remaining under these agreements is
    approximately $519.1 million as of December 31, 2006.
    However, this amount could be more or less depending on various
    factors such as the inflation rate, the introduction of
    significant new technologies, or changes in the Company’s
    data processing needs. The Company is still in the process of
    evaluating certain of these agreements and, as part of the
    integration plans resulting from the Certegy Merger, has decided
    to terminate one of these plans and may ultimately terminate
    additional agreements. The Company must pay a termination charge
    for the agreement that has been cancelled and will have to pay
    additional charges in the event of further terminations.

Synthetic Leases.

As discussed in Note 7,
    the Company is the tenant of the Florida Leased Property. The
    original cost to the lessor of the Florida Leased Property when
    Certegy entered into the Florida Lease was approximately
    $23.2 million. Subject to the satisfaction of certain
    conditions, upon the expiration (or any earlier termination) of
    the Florida Lease, the Company will be obligated to acquire the
    Florida Leased Property at its original cost.

Additionally, a February 1, 2006 amendment to the Florida
    Lease included a provision that would require the Company to
    purchase the Florida Leased Property at its original cost if, by
    May 1, 2006, the lender financing the Florida Lease had
    concluded either that: (i) the current value of the Florida
    Leased Property (as reflected on an appraisal being performed at
    the direction of the lender) was not sufficient for the original
    cost of the Florida Leased Property to constitute no more than
    70% of the current value (but, instead of being required to
    purchase the Florida Leased Property, the Company would have the
    right to repay a sufficient portion of the lessor’s
    original cost to maintain such 70% limit); or
    (ii) environmental conditions existed in connection with
    the Florida Leased Property (other than to the extent previously
    disclosed by the Company to the lender) that could adversely
    affect the Florida Leased Property.

The Florida Lease was subsequently amended on April 28,
    2006 to (i) provide the lender with the right to obtain
    appraisals on the Florida Leased property in the future; and
    (ii) if the current value of the Florida Leased Property
    (as reflected in the most recently obtained appraisal) is not
    sufficient for the original cost of the Florida Leased Property
    to constitute no more than 70% of the current value, provide the
    Lender with the right to demand that the Company (at the
    Company’s election) either prepay the lease balance or
    provide cash collateral so that after giving effect to such
    prepayment or cash collateral the current value of the Florida
    Lease Property (as reflected in such appraisal) is sufficient
    for the original cost of the Florida Leased Property to
    constitute no more than 70% of the current value.

The Company also has a synthetic lease arrangement (the
    “Wisconsin Lease”) which is not included in the
    Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet with respect to its
    facilities in Madison, Wisconsin (the “Wisconsin Leased
    Property”). In connection with the Certegy Merger, the term
    of the Wisconsin Lease was amended so that it was scheduled to
    expire on December 31, 2006. The term of the Wisconsin
    Lease has since been further amended to extend the expiration
    date to June 30, 2007. The original cost to the lessor of
    the Wisconsin Leased Property when Certegy entered into the
    Wisconsin Lease was approximately $10.1 million. Subject to
    the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Company has the
    option to acquire the Wisconsin Leased Property at its original
    cost, or to direct the sale of the Wisconsin Leased Property to
    a third party.

At the expiration of the term of the Wisconsin Lease, if the
    Wisconsin Leased Property has not been purchased by the Company
    or sold to a third party at the direction of the Company, the
    lessor may elect to sell the Wisconsin

Leased Property. If the proceeds of such a sale do not cover a
    specified percentage of the original cost of the Wisconsin
    Leased Property, then pursuant to the provisions of a residual
    value guarantee made by the Company to the lessor and its
    lender, the Company is obligated to pay any resulting shortfall
    (but not more than approximately $8.1 million). Based on
    the current fair market value of the Wisconsin Leased Property,
    the Company does not expect to be required to make payments
    under this residual value guarantee.

(16)  Employee
    Benefit Plans

Stock
    Purchase Plan

Prior to the Certegy Merger (note 5), FIS employees
    participated in the Fidelity National Financial, Inc. Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). Subsequent to the Certegy Merger,
    the Company instituted its own plan with the same terms as the
    Fidelity National Financial, Inc. plan. Under the terms of both
    plans and subsequent amendments, eligible employees may
    voluntarily purchase, at current market prices, shares of
    FNF’s (prior to the FNF merger) or FIS’s (post FNF
    merger) common stock through payroll deductions. Pursuant to the
    ESPP, employees may contribute an amount between 3% and 15% of
    their base salary and certain commissions. Shares purchased are
    allocated to employees, based upon their contributions. The
    Company contributes varying matching amounts as specified in the
    ESPP. The Company recorded an expense of $13.1 million,
    $11.1 million, and $8.1 million, respectively, for the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 relating to
    the participation of FIS employees in the ESPP.

401(k)
    Profit Sharing Plan

The Company’s employees are covered by a qualified 401(k)
    plan. Prior to the Certegy Merger, this plan was sponsored by
    FNF. Eligible employees may contribute up to 40% of their pretax
    annual compensation, up to the amount allowed pursuant to the
    Internal Revenue Code. The Company generally matches 50% of each
    dollar of employee contribution up to 6% of the employee’s
    total eligible compensation. The Company recorded
    $19.0 million, $15.7 million and $12.7 million,
    respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
    and 2004 relating to the participation of FIS employees in the
    401(k) plan.

Stock
    Option Plans

In 2005, the Company adopted the FIS 2005 Stock Incentive Plan
    (the “Plan”). As of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    there were 6,726,667 and 8,985,421 options outstanding under
    this plan, respectively, at a strike price of $15.63 per
    share (as adjusted for the .6396 exchange ratio in the Certegy
    transaction). These stock options were granted at the fair value
    of the Company’s stock on the grant date based on the price
    for which the Company sold 32 million shares (a 25%
    interest) to the financial sponsors in the recapitalization
    transaction on March 9, 2005. The Plan provides for the
    grant of stock options and restricted stock, representing up to
    10,371,892 shares. The options granted thus far under this
    plan have a term of 10 years and vest over either a 4 or
    5 year period (the “time-based options”) on a
    quarterly basis or based on specific performance criteria (the
    “performance-based options”). The time-based options
    vest with respect to


/


or


/


of the total number of shares subject to such time-based options
    on the last day of each fiscal quarter. The performance-based
    options vest for certain key employees in the event of a change
    in control or after an initial public offering solely if one of
    the following targets shall be met: (a) 50% of the total
    number of shares subject to such performance based options vest
    if the public trading value of a share of common stock equals at
    least $27.36 and (b) 100% of the total number of shares
    subject to such performance based options will vest if the
    public trading value of a share of common stock equals at least
    $31.27, provided the optionee’s service has not terminated
    prior to the applicable vesting date. For the remaining
    employees, vesting of the performance-based options occurs in
    the event of a change in control or an initial public offering
    and if the public trading value of common stock equals at least
    $31.27 provided the optionee’s service with FIS has not
    terminated prior to the applicable vesting date.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Through the Certegy Merger, the Company assumed the Certegy Inc.
    Stock Incentive Plan that provides for the issuance of qualified
    and non-qualified stock options to officers and other key
    employees at exercise prices not less than market on the date of
    grant. All options and awards outstanding prior to the Certegy
    Merger under the Certegy Plan were fully vested as of the
    Certegy Merger date. As part of the Certegy Merger, the Certegy
    shareholders approved amendments to the plan and approved an
    additional 6 million shares to be made available under the
    plan. During the period from February 1, 2006 through
    December 31, 2006, the Company has granted 4,693,000
    options under this plan. There were 7,773,588 options
    outstanding under this plan at December 31, 2006.

On November 9, 2006, as part of the closing of the FNF
    Merger, the Company assumed certain options and restricted stock
    grants that the Company’s employees and directors held in
    FNF in certain FNF stock option plans. The Company assumed
    2,731,770 options to replace approximately 4.9 million
    outstanding FNF options per the FNF Merger Agreement. The
    Company also assumed 0.1 million shares of restricted stock.

Certain FIS employees are participants in FNF’s stock-based
    compensation plans, which provide for the granting of incentive
    and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock and other
    stock-based incentive awards for officers and key employees.
    Grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options under these
    plans have generally provided that options shall vest equally
    over three years and generally expire ten years after their
    original date of grant. All options granted under these plans
    have an exercise price equal to the market value of the
    underlying common stock on the date of grant. There were no FNF
    options granted to FIS employees in the year ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005. The Company recorded expense
    relating to FNF options of $3.8 million $15.4 million
    and $3.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively. All FNF options and restricted
    stock for which the Company now records expense were converted
    into FIS options and restricted stock in the FNF Merger noted
    above.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair
    value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123R”)
    effective as of January 1, 2006. Prior to January 1,
    2006, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation using
    the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS No. 123”) which the Company
    adopted on January 1, 2003 under the prospective method as
    permitted by SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure

(“SFAS No. 148”). Under this method,
    stock-based employee compensation cost was recognized from the
    beginning of 2003 as if the fair value method of accounting had
    been used to account for all employee awards granted, modified,
    or settled in years beginning after December 31, 2002. The
    Company has provided for stock compensation expense of
    $50.1 million, $20.4 million and $15.4 million
    for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which is included in
    selling, general, and administrative expense in the Consolidated
    and Combined Statements of Earnings. The year ended 2006
    included stock compensation expense of $24.5 million
    relating to the FIS performance based options granted on
    March 9, 2005 for which the performance and market based
    criteria for vesting were met during the period and a
    $6.1 million charge relating to the acceleration of option
    vesting per the FNF Merger Agreement. There was no material
    impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R as all options
    related to the Company’s employees from FNF grants that had
    been accounted for under other methods were fully vested as of
    December 31, 2005. All grants of FIS options have been
    accounted for under fair value accounting under SFAS 123 or
    SFAS 123R.

The fair value relating to the time-based options granted by the
    Company in 2005 was estimated using a Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model, while the fair value relating to the
    performance-based options was estimated using a Monte-Carlo
    option pricing model due to the vesting characteristics of those
    options, as discussed above. The following assumptions were used
    for the 4,798,747 time-based options granted in 2005; the risk
    free interest rate was 4.2%, the volatility factor for the
    expected market price of the common stock was 44%, the expected
    dividend yield was zero and weighted average expected life was
    5 years. The fair value of each time-based option was
    $6.79. Since the Company was not publicly traded when these FIS
    options were issued, the Company relied on industry peer data to
    determine the volatility assumption and for the expected life
    assumption, the Company used an average of several methods,
    including FNF’s historical exercise history, peer firm
    data, publicly available industry data and the Safe Harbor
    approach as stated in the SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletin 107. The following assumptions were used

CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

for the valuation of the 4,199,466 performance-based options
    granted in 2005: the risk free interest rate was 4.2%, the
    volatility factor for the expected market price of the common
    stock was 44%, the expected dividend yield was zero and the
    objective time to exercise was 4.7 years with an objective
    in the money assumption of 2.95 years. It was also expected
    that the initial public offering assumption would occur within a
    9 month period from grant date. The fair value of the
    performance-based options was calculated to be $5.85.

The fair value for FIS options granted in 2006 was estimated at
    the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model
    with the following weighted average assumptions. The risk free
    interest rates used in the calculation are the rate that
    corresponds to the weighted average expected life of an option.
    The risk free interest rate used for options granted during 2006
    was 4.9%. A volatility factor for the expected market price of
    the common stock of 30% was used for options granted in 2006.
    The expected dividend yield used for 2006 was 0.5%. A weighted
    average expected life of 6.4 years was used for 2006. The
    weighted average fair value of each option granted during 2006
    was $15.52.

At December 31, 2006, the total unrecognized compensation
    cost related to non-vested stock option grants is
    $86.1 million, which is expected to be recognized in
    pre-tax income over a weighted average period of 1.9 years.

The Company intends to limit dilution caused by option
    exercises, including anticipated exercises, by repurchasing
    shares on the open market or in privately negotiated
    transactions. During 2006, the Company repurchased
    4,261,200 shares at an average price of $37.60. On
    October 25, 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors
    approved a plan authorizing the repurchase of up to an
    additional $200 million worth of the Company’s common
    stock.

Defined
    Benefit Plans

Certegy
    Pension Plan

In connection with the Certegy Merger, the Company announced
    that it will terminate and settle the Certegy
    U.S. Retirement Income Plan (USRIP). The estimated impact
    of this settlement was reflected in the purchase price
    allocation as an increase in the pension liability, less the
    fair value of the pension plan assets, based on estimates of the
    total cost to settle the liability through the purchase of
    annuity contracts or lump sum settlements to the beneficiaries.
    The final settlement will not occur until after an IRS
    determination has been obtained, which is expected to be
    received in 2007. In addition to the net pension plan obligation
    of $21.6 million, the Company assumed liabilities of
    $8.0 million for Certegy’s Supplemental Executive
    Retirement Plan (“SERP”) and $3.0 million for a
    Postretirement Benefit Plan.

(17)  Concentration
    of Risk

The Company generates a significant amount of revenue from large
    customers, however, no customers accounted for more than 10% of
    total revenue or total segment revenue in the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash
    equivalents and trade receivables.

The Company places its cash equivalents with high credit quality
    financial institutions and, by policy, limits the amount of
    credit exposure with any one financial institution.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables
    are limited because a large number of geographically diverse
    customers make up the Company’s customer base, thus
    spreading the trade receivables credit risk. The Company
    controls credit risk through monitoring procedures.

(18)  Segment
    Information

Upon completion of the Certegy Merger, the Company implemented a
    new organizational structure, which resulted in a new operating
    segment structure beginning with the reporting of first quarter
    2006 results. Effective as of February 1, 2006, the
    Company’s operating segments are Transaction Processing
    Services, or TPS, and Lender Processing Services, or LPS. This
    structure reflects how the businesses are operated and managed.
    The primary components of the TPS segment, which includes
    Certegy’s Card and Check Services and the financial
    institution processing component of the former Financial
    Institution Software and Services segment of FIS, are Enterprise
    Solutions, Integrated Financial Solutions and International
    businesses. The primary components of the LPS segment are
    Mortgage Information Services businesses, which includes the
    mortgage lender processing component of the former Financial
    Institution Software and Services segment of FIS, and the former
    Lender Services, Default Management, and Information Services
    segments of FIS.

Transaction
    Processing Services

The Transaction Processing Services segment focuses on filling
    the processing needs of large financial institutions, commercial
    lenders, independent community banks, credit unions and
    retailers. The primary applications are software applications
    that function as the underlying infrastructure of a financial
    institution’s processing environment. These applications
    include core bank processing software which banks use to
    maintain the primary records of their customer accounts. This
    segment also provides a number of complementary applications and
    services that interact directly with the core processing
    applications, including applications that facilitate
    interactions between the segment’s financial institution
    customers and their clients. In addition, this segment includes
    credit card, debit card, and other transaction processing and
    check risk management services. Included in this segment were
    $450.0 million, $184.3 million and $132.8 million
    in sales to

non-U.S. based

customers in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively. Also included in this segment are net
    assets, excluding Goodwill and Other Intangible assets, located
    outside of the United States totaling $296.5 million at
    December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    the amount of net assets located outside of the United States
    was immaterial. These assets are predominately located in
    Germany and South America.

Lender
    Processing Services

The Lender Processing Services segment provides a comprehensive
    range of products and services related to the mortgage life
    cycle. The primary applications include core mortgage processing
    which banks use to process and service mortgage loans as well as
    other products and services including origination, title agency,
    data gathering, risk management, servicing, default management
    and property disposition services to lenders and other real
    estate professionals.

Corporate
    and Other

    overhead costs that are not allocated to any operating segments.

Controls
    and Procedures.

As of the end of the year covered by this report, the Company
    carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of its principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such
    term is defined in

Rule 13a-15

(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the
    Company’s principal executive officer and principal
    financial officer concluded that its disclosure controls and
    procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that
    its disclosure controls and procedures will timely alert them to
    material information required to be included in the
    Company’s periodic SEC reports.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter
    that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
    Management has adopted the framework in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). Based on our evaluation under this framework, our
    management concluded that our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006. Our
    management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting, and the effectiveness
    of our internal control over financial reporting, as of
    December 31, 2006 have been audited by KPMG LLP, an
    independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
    their report which is included herein.
