2008 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT




Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires all references to “FIS,” “we”, the
“Company” or the “registrant” are to Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., a Georgia
corporation formerly known as Certegy Inc. (“Certegy”), which was the surviving legal entity in the
Certegy Merger; all references to “eFunds” are to eFunds Corporation, and its subsidiaries, as
acquired by FIS on September 12, 2007; all references to “Old FNF” are to Fidelity National
Financial, Inc., which owned a majority of the Company’s shares through November 9, 2006; all
references to “FNF” are to Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (formerly known as Fidelity National
Title Group, Inc. (“FNT”)), formerly a subsidiary of Old FNF but now an independent company that
remains a related entity from an accounting perspective; and all references to “LPS” are to Lender
Processing Services, Inc., a former wholly owned subsidiary of FIS, which was spun-off as a
separate publicly traded company on July 2, 2008.

PART I

Item 1.

Business.

General Development of the Business

Our business operations and organizational structure result from the February 1, 2006,
business combination of FIS and Certegy (the “Certegy Merger”), pursuant to which FIS was merged
into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Certegy. Immediately after the Certegy Merger, the stockholders
of FIS, including its then-majority stockholder Old FNF, owned approximately 67.4% of the Company’s
outstanding common stock. Accordingly, for accounting and financial reporting purposes, the Certegy
Merger was treated as a reverse acquisition of Certegy by FIS using the purchase method of
accounting pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Under this accounting
treatment, although Certegy was the legal entity that survived the merger, FIS was viewed as the
acquirer for accounting purposes, and our financial statements and other disclosures for periods
prior to the Certegy Merger treat FIS as our predecessor company. Also, as a result of the Certegy
Merger, the registrant’s name changed from “Certegy Inc.” to “Fidelity National Information
Services, Inc.” and our New York Stock Exchange trading symbol from “CEY” to “FIS”. On November 9,
2006, Old FNF (after other transactions in which it distributed all of its assets other than its
ownership in FIS) merged with and into FIS (the “FNF Merger”). Upon completion of the FNF Merger,
FIS became an independent publicly traded company, and Old FNF ceased to exist as an independent
publicly traded company. The assets distributed by Old FNF prior to the FNF Merger included its
ownership in FNT, which following the FNF Merger renamed itself Fidelity National Financial, Inc.

We are incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia, where Certegy was initially
incorporated on March 2, 2001. Although many of these acquisitions added important applications and
services to the offerings of FIS, our long-term objectives have been driven primarily by internal
growth and the following acquisitions:

Financial Information About Operating Segments and Geographic Areas

On July 2, 2008, we completed the spin-off of our former lender processing services segment
into a separate publicly traded company, Lender Processing Services, Inc., referred to as LPS. The
results of operations of the lender processing services segment are reflected as discontinued
operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets

(“SFAS 144”), for all



periods presented. Subsequent to the LPS spin-off, we reviewed our reporting and management
structure, and beginning with this Form 10-K, are reporting the results of our operations in four
new reporting segments: 1) Financial Solutions, 2) Payment Solutions, 3) International and 4)
Corporate and Other. All periods presented have been conformed to reflect the segment changes.

Narrative Description of the Business

FIS is a leading provider of technology solutions, processing services and information-based
services to the financial services industry. We offer a diversified service mix and
benefit from the opportunity to cross-sell multiple services across our broad customer base. FIS
is a member of Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index.

As of December 31, 2008 we have over 14,000 customers in over 90 countries spanning all
segments of the financial services industry. These customers include
40 of the top 50 world banks, including nine of the top 10, as ranked by Bankalmanac.com as of April 30, 2008, as well as mid-tier and community banks, credit
unions, commercial lenders, automotive financial institutions, retailers and international
customers. Additionally, we provide services to numerous retailers via our check processing
services. No individual customer represents more than 10% of our revenues.

Financial Solutions

The primary focus of our Financial Solutions segment is servicing the core and related
ancillary processing needs of U.S. banks, credit unions, automotive financial companies, commercial
lenders, independent community and savings institutions. Our product and service offerings in this
segment include:



•

Commercial Technology

. Our commercial technology includes solutions designed to meet the
technology challenges facing any client, large or small. Our technology solutions range in
scope from consulting engagements to application development projects and from operations
support for a single application to full management of information technology
infrastructures.

•

Global Solutions

. Our global solutions business provides outsourcing teams, both onshore
and offshore, to manage costs, improve operational efficiency, transform processes and
deliver world-class customer service all around the world.

•

Risk Management.

Our risk management services utilize our proprietary risk management
models and data sources to assist in detecting fraud and assessing the risk of opening a new
account or accepting a check at either the point-of-sale, a physical branch location, or
through the Internet. Our systems utilize a combination of advanced authentication
procedures, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence modeling, neural networks and
proprietary and shared databases to assess and detect fraud risk for deposit transactions for
financial institutions.

•

Ancillary Solutions

. We offer a number of services that are ancillary to the primary
products and services listed above including branch automation, back office support systems
and compliance support.

We employ several business models to provide our solutions to our customers. We typically
deliver the highest value to our customers when we combine our software applications and deliver
them in one of several types of outsourcing arrangements, such as an application service provider,
facilities management processing or an application management arrangement. We are also able to
deliver individual applications through a software licensing arrangement. Based upon the expertise
gained through the foregoing arrangements, some clients also use us to manage their IT operations
without providing any of our proprietary software.

Payment Solutions

Our Payment Solutions segment is focused on servicing the payment and electronic funds
transfer needs of U.S. banks, credit unions, automotive financial companies, commercial lenders,
independent community and savings institutions. Our product and service offerings in this segment
include:



•

Check Authorization.

Our check authorization system utilizes artificial intelligence
modeling, neural networks and other state-of-the-art technology to deliver accuracy,
convenience and simplicity to retailers.

•

Ancillary Solutions.

We offer a number of services that are ancillary to the primary
products and services listed above, including print and mail capabilities. Our print and
mail services offer complete computer output solutions for the creation, management and
delivery of print and fulfillment needs.

International

We provide core banking applications, item processing, card services and check risk management
solutions to financial institutions, card issuers, and retailers in over 90 countries outside the
United States. Our international operations leverage existing domestic applications and provide
services for the specific business needs of our customers in targeted international markets. Our
product and service offering includes a comprehensive range of financial and payment processing
software and services. Our payment solutions services include fully outsourced card issuer services
and customer support, item processing and retail point-of-sale check authorization services. Our
financial solutions services include fully outsourced core bank processing arrangements,
application management, software licensing and maintenance, facilities management and consulting
services.

Corporate and Other Segment

The Corporate and Other segment consists of the corporate overhead costs that are not
allocated to any operating segments. These include costs related to human resources, finance,
accounting, domestic sales and marketing and amortization of acquisition related intangibles and
other costs that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance.

Sales and Marketing

We have teams of experienced sales personnel with expertise in particular services or the
needs of particular types of customers. We target the majority of our potential customers via
direct and/or indirect field sales, as well as inbound and outbound telemarketing efforts.
Marketing activities include direct marketing, print advertising, media relations, public
relations, tradeshow and convention activities, seminars and other targeted activities. Our sales
force also targets existing customers to promote the cross-selling of additional products and
services to our existing client base. Our strategy is to use the most efficient delivery system
available to successfully acquire clients and build awareness of our products and services.

Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices, and
applicable law to establish and protect our software, technology and expertise worldwide. Further,
we have developed a number of brands that have accumulated substantial goodwill in the marketplace,
and we rely on trademark law to protect our rights in those brands. While we intend to continue
taking appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property rights, these legal protections
and arrangements afford only limited protection, and there is no assurance that our competitors
will not independently develop or license products, services, or capabilities that are
substantially equivalent or superior to ours. In general, we own the proprietary rights necessary
for the conduct of our business, although we do license certain items from third parties under
arms-length agreements for varying terms.

Competition

Our primary competitors include internal technology departments within financial institutions
and retailers, data processing or software development departments of large companies or large
computer manufacturers, third-party payment processors, independent computer services firms,
companies that develop and deploy software applications, companies that provide customized
development, implementation and support services and companies that market software for the
financial services industry. Some of these competitors possess substantially greater financial,
sales and marketing resources than we do. Competitive factors impacting the success of our products
and services include the quality of the technology-based application or service, application
features and functions, ease of delivery and integration, ability of the provider to maintain,
enhance, and support the applications or services, and price. We believe that we compete favorably
in each of these categories. In addition, we believe that our financial institution industry
expertise, combined with our ability to offer multiple applications, services and integrated
solutions to individual customers, enhances our competitiveness against companies with more limited
offerings. Specific competitors for both financial and payment solutions include:



Fiserv, Inc., Jack Henry and Associates, Inc. and Metavante Corporation. In the core
processing market, we also compete with Open Solutions, Inc., International Business Machines
Corporation (IBM), Accenture Ltd., and in certain non-U.S. markets, Alnova Technologies
Corporation, I-Flex Solutions Limited n/k/a Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Temenos
Group AG. Our competitors in the card services market include third-party credit and debit card
processors such as First Data Corporation, Total System Services, Inc., Electronic Data Systems
Corporation (EDS) and Payment Systems for Credit Unions (PSCU). Competitors in the check risk
management services market include First Data Corporation’s TeleCheck Services division, and Global
Payments, Inc.

Research and Development

Our research and development activities have related primarily to the design and development
of processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms. We expect to
continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain, enhance and
extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications, to develop
new and innovative software applications and systems in response to the needs of our customers, and
to enhance the capabilities surrounding our outsourcing infrastructure. In addition, we intend to
offer services that are compatible with new and emerging delivery channels.

As part of our research and development process, we evaluate current and emerging technology
for compatibility with our existing and future software platforms. To this end, we engage with
various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components. Where
appropriate, we use third-party technology components in the development of our software
applications and service offerings. Third-party software may be used for highly specialized
business functions, which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget
constraints. Additionally, third-party software may be used for commodity type functions within a
technology platform environment. In the case of nearly all of our third-party software, enterprise
license agreements exist for the third-party component and either alternative suppliers exist or
transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply. As a result, we are not materially
dependent upon any third-party technology components. We work with our customers to determine the
appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our
applications and services. In the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 we recorded expense
of approximately $84.8 million, $70.4 million, and $70.9 million, respectively, on research and
development efforts (excluding amounts capitalized).

Government Regulation

Our products and services are subject to a broad range of complex federal, state, and foreign
regulation, including federal truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings rules, Regulation AA (Unfair or
Deceptive Acts or Practices), privacy laws, usury laws, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the
Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Community
Reinvestment Act. The compliance of our products and services with these and other applicable laws
and regulations depends on a variety of factors, including the manner in which our clients use
them. Our clients are contractually responsible for determining what is required of them under
applicable laws and regulations so that we can assist them in their compliance efforts. The failure
of our products and services to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in
restrictions on our ability to provide them, as well as the imposition of civil fines and/or
criminal penalties. The four principal areas of regulation impacting our business are:

•

Privacy

. Our financial institution clients are required to comply with privacy
regulations imposed under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These regulations place restrictions
on the use of non-public personal information. All financial institutions must disclose
detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the
financial institution not to share information with third parties. The new regulations,
however, permit financial institutions to share information with non-affiliated parties who
perform services for the financial institutions. As a provider of services to financial
institutions, we are required to comply with the privacy regulations and are bound by the
same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our customers as apply to
the financial institutions themselves.

•

Consumer Reporting

. Our retail check authorization services (Certegy Check Services) and
account opening services (ChexSystems) maintain databases of consumer information and, as a
consequence, are subject to the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar state laws.
Among other things, the Fair Credit Reporting Act imposes requirements on us concerning
data accuracy, and provides that consumers have the right to know the contents of their
files, to dispute their accuracy, and to require verification or removal of disputed
information. In furtherance of our objectives of data accuracy, fair treatment of
consumers, protection of consumers’ personal information, and compliance with these laws,
we maintain a high level of security for our computer systems in which consumer data
resides, and we maintain consumer relations call



centers to facilitate efficient handling of consumer requests for information and handling
disputes.

•

Debt Collection

. Our collection services are subject to the Federal Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act and various state collection laws and licensing requirements. The Federal
Trade Commission, as well as state attorneys general and other agencies, have enforcement
responsibility over the collection laws, as well as the various credit reporting laws.

•

Money Transfer

. Elements of our cash access and money transmission businesses are
registered as a Money Services Business and are subject to the USA Patriot Act and
reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and U.S. Treasury Regulations. This business
is also subject to various state, local and tribal licensing requirements. The Financial
Crimes Enforcement Network, state attorneys general, and other agencies have enforcement
responsibility over laws relating to money laundering, currency transmission, and
licensing. In addition, most states have enacted statutes that require entities engaged in
money transmission and the sale of stored value cards to register as a money transmitter
with that jurisdiction’s banking department.

As a provider of electronic data processing and back-office services to financial institutions
we are also subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions
Examination Council, an interagency body of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office
of Thrift Supervision, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, the National Credit Union Administration and various state regulatory
authorities. In addition, independent auditors annually review several of our operations to provide
reports on internal controls for our customers’ auditors and regulators. We are also subject to
review by state and foreign laws and rules that regulate many of the same activities that are
described above, including electronic data processing and back-office services for financial
institutions and use of consumer information.

The foregoing list of laws and regulations to which our company is subject is not exhaustive,
and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously. Although we do not
believe that compliance with future laws and regulations related to our businesses will have a
material adverse effect on our company, enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly
affect the operations of our business, directly and indirectly, which could result in substantial
regulatory compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity, and/or loss of revenue.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 26,000 employees, including approximately 15,000
employees principally employed outside of the U.S. None of our U.S. workforce currently is
unionized. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with employees
to be good.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

In addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and
uncertainties, including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. Any of the risks described herein could result in a significant adverse effect on our
results of operation and financial condition.

If we fail to adapt our services to changes in technology or in the marketplace, or if our ongoing
efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful, we could lose customers and have difficulty
attracting new customers for our services.

The markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes, frequent
introductions of new services and evolving industry standards. Our future success will be
significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current services, and develop and introduce
new services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers and their clients.
These



initiatives carry the risks associated with any new service development effort, including cost
overruns, delays in delivery, and performance issues. There can be no assurance that we will be
successful in developing, marketing and selling new services that meet these changing demands, that
we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development,
introduction, and marketing of these services, or that our new services and their enhancements will
adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance.

We may experience defects, development delays, installation difficulties and system failures with
respect to our technology solutions, which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to
potential liability.

Many of our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems, and we may
encounter delays when developing new technology solutions and services. Further, the technology
solutions underlying our services have occasionally contained and may in the future contain
undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released. In addition,
we may experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by
our customers. Finally, our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from
fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry and computer
viruses. Defects in our technology solutions, errors or delays in the processing of electronic
transactions, or other difficulties could result in: (i) interruption of business operations; (ii)
delay in market acceptance; (iii) additional development and remediation costs; (iv) diversion of
technical and other resources; (v) loss of customers; and (vi) negative publicity; or exposure to
liability claims.

Any one or more of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Although we attempt to limit our potential liability
through disclaimers and limitation-of-liability provisions in our license and customer agreements,
we cannot be certain that these measures will always be successful in limiting our liability.

We operate in a competitive business environment, and if we are unable to compete effectively our
results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.

The market for our services is intensely competitive. Our competitors vary in size and in the
scope and breadth of the services they offer. Some of our competitors have substantial resources.
We face direct competition from third parties, and since many of our larger potential customers
have historically developed their key applications in-house and therefore view their system
requirements from a make-versus-buy perspective, we often compete against our potential customers’
in-house capacities. In addition, we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to
attract new competitors and new technologies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures we face in
the markets in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

Our revenues from the sale of services to members of VISA, MasterCard, American Express and other
similar organizations are dependent upon our continued certification and sponsorship, and the loss
or suspension of certification or sponsorship could adversely affect our business.

In order to provide our card processing services, we must be certified by Visa, MasterCard,
American Express and other similar organizations. These certifications are dependent upon our
continued adherence to the standards of the issuing bodies. The member financial institutions, some
of which are our competitors, set the standards with which we must comply. If we fail to comply
with these standards, our certifications could be suspended or terminated. The termination of our
certifications, or any changes in the rules and regulations governing VISA, MasterCard, American
Express or other similar organizations could prevent our registration or otherwise limit our
ability to provide services, which could result in a reduction in revenue or increased costs of
operation, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Potential customers may be reluctant to switch to a new vendor, which may adversely affect our
growth, both in the U.S. and internationally.

For banks and other potential customers of our financial information software and services,
switching from one vendor of bank core processing or related software and services (or from an
internally-developed system) to a new vendor is a significant undertaking. Many potential customers
worry about potential disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality, increased costs and
business disruption. As a result, potential customers, both in the U.S. and internationally, often
resist change. We seek to overcome this resistance through strategies such as making investments to
enhance the functionality of our software. However, there can be no assurance that our strategies
for overcoming potential customers’ reluctance to change vendors will be successful, and this
resistance may adversely affect our growth, both in the U.S. and internationally.



Demand for many of our services is sensitive to the level of consumer transactions generated by our
customers, and accordingly, our revenues could be impacted negatively by the current recession or
any other event causing a material slowing of consumer spending.

A significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees. Any changes
in economic factors, such as the current recession, that adversely affect consumer spending and
related consumer debt, or lead to a reduction in check writing or credit and debit card usage,
could reduce the volume of transactions that we process, and have an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

We have a long sales cycle for many of our applications and if we fail to close sales after
expending significant time and resources to do so, our business, financial condition, and results
of operations may be adversely affected.

The implementation of many of our applications often involves significant capital commitments
by our customers, particularly those with smaller operational scale. Potential customers generally
commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and require us to expend
substantial time, effort, and money educating them as to the value of our software and services. We
incur substantial costs in order to obtain each new customer. We may expend significant funds and
management resources during the sales cycle and ultimately fail to close the sale. Our sales cycle
may be extended due to our customers’ budgetary constraints or for other reasons. If we are
unsuccessful in closing sales after expending significant funds and management resources or we
experience delays, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
and results of operations.

Many of our customers are subject to a regulatory environment and to industry standards that may
change in a manner that reduces the number of transactions in which our customers engage and
therefore reduces our revenues.

Our customers are subject to a number of government regulations and industry standards with
which our services must comply. For example, our services are affected by VISA, MasterCard,
American Express and electronic payment standards that are generally updated twice annually. In
addition, action by regulatory authorities relating to credit availability, data usage, privacy, or
other related regulatory developments could have an adverse effect on our customers and therefore
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

Security breaches or our own failure to comply with privacy regulations imposed on providers of
services to financial institutions could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services
and damaging our reputation.

As part of our business, we electronically receive, process, store and transmit sensitive
business information of our customers. In addition, we collect personal consumer data, such as
names and addresses, social security numbers, driver’s license numbers and payment history records.
Unauthorized access to our computer systems or databases could result in the theft or publication
of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause
interruptions in our operations. These concerns about security are increased when we transmit
information over the Internet.

Additionally, as a provider of services to financial institutions, we are bound by the same
limitations on disclosure of the information we receive from our customers as apply to the
financial institutions themselves. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we could be exposed
to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings. In addition, if more restrictive
privacy laws or rules are adopted in the future on the federal or state level, that could have an
adverse impact on us. Any inability to prevent security or privacy breaches could cause our
existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us, and
could inhibit our ability to attract new customers and/or adversely impact our relationship with
administrative agencies.

Misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive
position.

Our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology. Despite our efforts to
protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or
to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our
proprietary rights is difficult. We cannot make any assurances that the steps we have taken will
prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be
enforceable. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be
available in every country in which our applications and services are made available online.
Misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.



We face liability to our merchant customers if checks that we have guaranteed are dishonored by the
check writer’s bank.

If a check that we have guaranteed is dishonored by the check writer’s bank, we must reimburse
our merchant customer for the check’s face value and pursue collection of the amount from the check
writer. In some cases, we recognize a liability to our merchant customers for estimated check
returns and a receivable for amounts we estimate we will recover from the check writers, based on
historical experience and other relevant factors. The estimated check returns and recovery amounts
are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned may exceed our estimates and actual amounts
recovered may be less than our estimates.

If our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others, we may be
required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and
monetary penalties.

As our information technology applications and services develop, we may become increasingly
subject to infringement claims. Any claims, whether with or without merit, could: (i) be expensive
and time-consuming to defend; (ii) cause us to cease making, licensing or using applications that
incorporate the challenged intellectual property; (iii) require us to redesign our applications, if
feasible; (iv) divert management’s attention and resources; and (v) require us to enter into
royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies.

Our business is subject to the risks of international operations, including movements in foreign
currency exchange rates.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue and earnings from international operations. As
a result, our financial condition and operating results could be significantly affected by risks
associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political
instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of
the U.S. Dollar versus local currencies. In addition, we are less well-known internationally than
in the United States, have less experience with local business conditions and will face challenges
in successfully managing small operations located far from our headquarters, because of the greater
difficulty in overseeing and guiding operations from a distance.

As we expand our international operations, more of our customers may pay us in foreign
currencies. Conducting business in currencies other than U.S. Dollars subjects us to fluctuations
in currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates
relate to foreign currencies in Brazil, Europe, Australia and parts of Asia. The U.S. Dollar value
of our net investments in foreign operations, the periodic conversion of foreign-denominated
earnings to the U.S. Dollar (our reporting currency), our results of operations and, in some cases,
cash flows, could be adversely affected in a material manner by movements in foreign currency
exchange rates. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, approximately 17% of our revenues
were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, including the Brazilian Real, British
pound and Euro. These risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.

Our existing levels of leverage and debt service requirements may adversely affect our financial
and operational flexibility.

As of December 31, 2008, we had total debt of approximately $2.5 billion. This level of debt
could have important consequences to us, including the following: (i) the debt level may cause us
to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions or other purposes and limits our ability to pursue other business opportunities and
implement certain business strategies; (ii) we use a large portion of the money we earn to pay
principal and interest on our senior credit facilities, which reduces the amount of money available
to finance operations, acquisitions and other business activities, repay other indebtedness and pay
shareholder dividends; (iii) some of our debt has a variable rate of interest, which exposes us to
the risk of increased interest rates; and (iv) we have a higher level of debt than some of our
competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce flexibility in responding to
changing business and economic conditions, including increased competition.

In addition, the terms of our senior credit facilities may restrict us from taking actions,
such as making significant acquisitions or dispositions or entering into certain agreements, which
we might believe to be advantageous to us.

If we are unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions, our results of operations
may be adversely affected.

We have made numerous acquisitions in recent years as a part of our growth strategy. We
anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses and services. This
strategy will depend on the ability to find suitable acquisitions and finance them



on acceptable terms. We may require additional debt or equity financing for future
acquisitions, and doing so will be made more difficult by our existing debt. If we are unable to
acquire suitable acquisition candidates, we may experience slower growth. Further, after
successfully completing acquisitions, we face challenges in integrating acquired businesses. These
challenges include eliminating redundant operations, facilities and systems, coordinating
management and personnel, retaining key employees, managing different corporate cultures, and
achieving cost reductions and cross-selling opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will
be able to fully integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or fully realize the
potential benefits of bringing them together, and the process of integrating these acquisitions may
disrupt our business and divert our resources.

We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect from the LPS spin-off.

We may not be able to achieve the strategic and financial benefits we expected to result from
the LPS spin-off or such benefits may be delayed. These outcomes may occur due to, among other
things, the loss of synergies, excess costs the two companies will incur as stand-alone entities,
or the obligations imposed on us to avoid certain transactions in respect of our capital stock in
order to preserve the planned tax-free nature of the transactions.

If any part of the LPS spin-off is determined to be a taxable transaction, then additional taxes
could be imposed on us and our shareholders.

On June 20, 2008, we received a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) regarding the contribution of our interest in the assets, liabilities, businesses
and employees related to our lender processing services operations in exchange for the receipt by
us of LPS common stock and LPS debt obligations, which we refer to as the contribution, the
exchange by us of LPS debt obligations for certain outstanding FIS debt, which we refer to as the
debt exchange, and the distribution of LPS common stock to our shareholders, which we refer to as
the spin-off. The IRS ruling was to the effect that: (i) the contribution taking into account the
spin-off will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, in which neither we nor LPS will
recognize any gain or loss; (ii) no gain or loss will be recognized by us in the debt exchange,
pursuant to Section 361 of the Code; and (iii) no gain or loss will be recognized by us or our
shareholders on the spin-off, pursuant to Section 355 and related provisions of the Code (including
Section 361(c) of the Code), except that any gain that our shareholders realize on cash received in
lieu of any fractional shares of our common stock to which such shareholders may be entitled in the
spin-off generally will be taxable to our shareholders.

Notwithstanding our receipt of the IRS private letter ruling, the IRS could determine that the
contribution, debt exchange and/or spin-off constitute taxable transactions if it determines that
there was a misstatement or omission of any of the facts, representations, or undertakings that
were included in the request for the private letter ruling, or if it disagrees with our conclusions
reached regarding certain factual requirements that, consistent with the IRS’ standard ruling
policy, were not covered by the IRS ruling.

If one or more of the contribution, debt exchange or spin-off transactions ultimately were
determined to be subject to tax, we would recognize gain and the amount of that gain would be up to
the excess of the fair market value of the LPS stock and debt obligations we received in the
contribution over our basis in the assets we contributed to LPS in the contribution. The amount of
such gain could be substantial. Further, if the spin-off transaction were subject to tax, in
addition to tax imposed on us, our shareholders generally would be treated as if they received a
taxable distribution equal to the full fair market value of LPS stock on the distribution date. In
addition, we could be subject to tax on certain of the preliminary asset transfers that were made
in connection with the contribution transaction.

Notwithstanding the favorable IRS ruling that the spin-off qualified for tax-free treatment,
it would become taxable to us, pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code, if 50% or more of the shares
of either our common stock or LPS common stock were acquired, directly or indirectly, as part of a
plan or series of related transactions that included the spin-off. If the IRS were to determine
that acquisitions of our common stock or of LPS common stock, either before or after the spin-off,
were part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spin-off, this
determination could result in the recognition of substantial gain by us under Section 355(e).

Although the taxes resulting from the contribution, debt exchange or spin-off not qualifying
for tax-free treatment for United States Federal income tax purposes generally would be imposed on
us and our shareholders, under the tax disaffiliation agreement entered into by us and LPS in
connection with the distribution, LPS would be required to indemnify us and our affiliates against
all tax related liabilities caused by the failure of any of those transactions to qualify for
tax-free treatment for United States Federal income tax purposes (including as a result of Section
355(e) of the Code) to the extent these liabilities arise as a result of any action taken by LPS or
any of LPS’ affiliates following the spin-off or otherwise result from any breach of any
representation, covenant or obligation of LPS or any of LPS’ affiliates under the tax
disaffiliation agreement.



There is no guaranty that LPS will have financial resources to satisfy any such
indemnification obligation described above.

The executive chairman of our board of directors and other officers and directors have interests
and positions that could present potential conflicts.

We and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to a variety of related party agreements with
FNF and LPS. William P. Foley, II, who is our Executive Chairman, is currently the Chairman of the
board of directors of both FNF and LPS. Lee A. Kennedy, who serves as President and Chief Executive
Officer of our company, is also a director of LPS. Brent B. Bickett, who is an officer of FIS, is
also an officer of FNF and LPS. William P. Foley, II and Brent B. Bickett also own or hold
substantial amounts of LPS and FNF stock and stock options. Thomas M. Hagerty and Richard N.
Massey, who are both directors of FIS, are also directors of FNF. As a result of the foregoing,
there may be circumstances where certain of our executive officers and directors may be subject to
conflicts of interest with respect to, among other things: (i) our past and ongoing relationships
with FNF and LPS, including related party agreements and other arrangements with respect to the
administration of tax matters, employee benefits and indemnification; (ii) the quality, pricing and
other terms associated with services that we provide to FNF and LPS, or that they provide to us,
under related party agreements; (iii) business opportunities arising for either us, FNF or LPS,
that could be pursued by either us, or by FNF or LPS; and (iv) conflicts of time with respect to
matters potentially or actually involving or affecting FIS.

We seek to manage these potential conflicts through, abstention, oversight by independent
members of our board of directors and provisions in our agreements with FNF and LPS. However, there
can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that we will be able to resolve all
potential conflicts with FNF and LPS, or that the resolution of any such conflicts will be no less
favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated third party.

We have substantial investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of
prior acquisitions, and a further more severe or continued economic downturn could cause these
investments to become impaired, requiring write-downs that would reduce our operating income.

As of December 31, 2008, goodwill aggregated to approximately $4,194.0 million,  55.8% of
total assets, and other indefinite lived intangible assets aggregated to approximately $152.0
million, 2.0% of total assets. Current accounting rules require goodwill and other indefinite
lived intangible assets to be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in
circumstances indicate potential impairment. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstance include significant
underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, a significant
decline in our stock price and market capitalization, and negative industry or economic trends.
The results of our fiscal year 2008 annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill indicated
that the fair value of the Company’s reporting units were in excess of the carrying value of those
reporting units, and thus no goodwill impairment existed as of December 31, 2008. Additionally,
other than with respect to our Certegy Check business, where we recorded an impairment charge of
$52.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets
was in excess of the carry value of those assets. However, if the current worldwide economic
downturn continues, the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible
assets may no longer be recoverable, and we may be required to record an impairment charge, which
would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We will continue
to monitor the fair value of our other indefinite lived intangible assets as well as our market
capitalization and the impact of the current economic downturn on our business to determine if
there is an impairment in future periods.

Consolidations and failures in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect
our business by eliminating some of our existing and potential customers and making us more
dependent on a more limited number of customers.

There has been and continues to be substantial consolidation activity in the banking and
financial services industry. In addition, many financial institutions that experienced negative
operating results, including some of our customers, have failed.

The failures and consolidations reduce the number of our customers and potential customers,
which could adversely affect our revenues even if the events do not reduce the aggregate activities
of the consolidated entities. Further, if our customers fail and/or merge with or are acquired by
other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue
or reduce use of our services. It is also possible that larger financial institutions resulting
from consolidations would have greater leverage in negotiating terms or could decide to perform
in-house some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide. Any of these
developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.



Losses, consolidations and failures in the financial services industry may impact our ability to
borrow funds or the ability of our lenders to fulfill their obligations under our interest rate
swap agreements.

Many financial institutions are currently experiencing negative operating results. In some
cases, these negative operating results have led to financial institution failures and/or
consolidations, including, in some cases, lenders that are parties to our Credit Agreement and
interest rate swap agreements. As a result, lenders may become insolvent or tighten lending
standards, which could in turn make it more difficult or impossible for lenders to perform their
obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or for us to borrow under our Credit Agreement,
obtain financing on favorable terms, or obtain financing or interest rate swap agreements at all.
Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a financial
institution fails to fulfill its obligations under our interest rate swap agreements or we are
unable to draw funds under our Credit Agreement or obtain other cost-effective financing.

Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information

The statements contained in this Form 10-K or in our other documents or in oral presentations
or other statements made by our management that are not purely historical are forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including statements regarding our expectations, hopes,
intentions, or strategies regarding the future. These statements relate to, among other things, our

FIS’ corporate headquarters is located at 601 Riverside Avenue, Jacksonville, Florida in a
facility leased from LPS. In addition, FIS owns or leases support centers, data processing
facilities and other facilities at over 190 locations. We believe our facilities and equipment are
generally well maintained and are in good operating condition. We believe that the computer
equipment that we own and our various facilities are adequate for our present and foreseeable
business needs. We maintain our own, and contract with multiple service providers to provide,
processing back-up in the event of a disaster.

Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “FIS.” The
table set forth below provides the high and low sales prices of the common stock and the cash
dividends declared per share of common stock for each quarter of 2008 and 2007. On July 2, 2008
(the “spin-off date”), all of the shares of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share of LPS,
previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of FIS, were distributed to FIS shareholders through a stock
dividend (the “spin-off”). In the spin-off, FIS contributed to LPS all of FIS’ interest in the
assets, liabilities, businesses and employees related to FIS’ Lender Processing Services segment in
exchange for shares of LPS common stock and $1,585.0 million aggregate principal amount of LPS debt
obligations, which we exchanged with the holders of our $1,585.0 Term Loan B and retired the latter
debt. Upon the distribution, FIS shareholders received one-half share of LPS common stock for every
share of FIS common stock held as of the close of business on June 24, 2008. FIS’ shareholders
collectively received 100% of the LPS Common Stock, which became a separate public company trading
under the symbol “LPS” on the New York Stock Exchange.

(a)

The sales prices of our common stock for the third and fourth quarter
of 2008 reflect the LPS spin-off. As of January 31, 2009, there were
approximately 8,947 shareholders of record of our common stock.

We currently pay a $0.05 dividend on a quarterly basis, and expect to continue to do so in the
future. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of
Directors, and depends on, among other things, our investment policy and opportunities, results of
operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors that may be
considered relevant by our Board of Directors, including legal and contractual restrictions.
Additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in our debt agreements. A
regular quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share is payable March 30, 2009 to shareholders of
record as of the close of business on March 16, 2009.

Item 12 of Part III contains information concerning securities authorized for issuance under
our equity compensation plans.

On October 25, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a plan authorizing repurchases of up to
$200.0 million worth of our common stock (the “Old Plan”). On April 17, 2008, our Board of
Directors approved a plan authorizing repurchases of up to an additional



$250.0 million worth of our common stock (the “New Plan”). Under the New Plan we repurchased
5.8 million shares of our common stock for $226.2 million, at an average price of $38.97, for the
year ended December 31, 2008. There were no stock repurchases during the 2008 fourth quarter.
During the year ended December 31, 2008, we also repurchased an additional 0.2 million shares of
our common stock for $10.0 million at an average price of $40.56 under the Old Plan. Total shares
repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2008 were 6.0 million shares for $236.2 million at
an average price of $39.04.



Item 6.

Selected Financial Data.

The selected financial data set forth below constitutes historical financial data of FIS and
should be read in conjunction with Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,
included elsewhere in this report.

On February 1, 2006, we completed the Certegy merger. For accounting and financial reporting
purposes, the merger was treated as a reverse acquisition of Certegy by FIS under the purchase
method of accounting pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, our
historical financial information for periods prior to the Certegy Merger is the historical
financial information of FIS.

On July 2, 2008, we completed the LPS spin-off. For accounting purposes the results of LPS are
presented as discontinued operations. Accordingly all prior periods have been restated to present
the results of FIS on a stand alone basis and include the results of LPS up to July 1, 2008 as
discontinued operations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following section discusses management’s view of the financial condition and results of
operations of FIS and its consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 and for the
years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

This section should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements
and related Notes of FIS included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements. See
“Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and
assumptions associated with these forward-looking statements that could cause future results to
differ materially from those reflected in this section.

Overview

We are one of the largest global providers of processing services to financial institutions
and businesses, serving customers in over 90 countries throughout the world. We are among the
market leaders in core processing, card issuing services and check point-of-sale verification and
guarantee. We offer a diversified service mix, and benefit from the opportunity to cross-sell
multiple services across



our broad customer base. We have four reporting segments: Financial Solutions, Payment
Solutions, International and Corporate and Other. A description of these segments is included
above in Item 1. Revenues by Segment and the results of operations of our segments are discussed
below in Segment Results of Operations.

Business Trends and Conditions

Increases in deposit and card transactions can positively affect our business and thus the
condition of the overall economy can have an effect on growth.

We compete for both licensing and outsourcing business, and thus are affected by the decisions
of financial institutions to utilize our services under an outsourced arrangement or to process
in-house under a software license and maintenance agreement. As a provider of outsourcing
solutions, we benefit from multi-year recurring revenue streams. Generally, demand for outsourcing
solutions has increased over time as service providers such as us realize economies of scale and
improve their ability to provide services that improve customer efficiencies and reduce costs.

Card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total point-of-sale payments, which
fuels continuing demand for card-related services. We continue to launch new services aimed at
accommodating this demand. In recent years, we have introduced a variety of stored-value card
types, Internet banking, and electronic bill presentment/payment services, as well as a number of
card enhancement and loyalty/reward programs. The common theme among these offerings continues to
be convenience and security for the consumer coupled with value to the financial institution.

Consolidation within the banking industry may be beneficial or detrimental to our businesses.
When consolidations occur, merger partners often operate disparate systems licensed from competing
service providers. The newly formed entity generally makes a determination to migrate its core
systems to a single platform. When a financial institution processing client is involved in a
consolidation, we may benefit by expanding the use of our services if such services are chosen to
survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity. Conversely, we may lose market
share if a customer of ours is involved in a consolidation and our services are not chosen to
survive the consolidation and support the newly combined entity.

We believe that we are facing one of the most difficult times that has ever existed for
financial institutions, retailers and other businesses in the United States and internationally.
We expect there to be a significant number of bank failures in the next few years, which may be
offset to a degree by somewhat decreased bank acquisition activity. However, we believe that our
potential exposure to bank failures and forced government actions that have occurred to date is
less than one half of one percent of our revenues. Additionally this exposure does not consider
any incremental revenues we may generate from potential license fees or service associated with
assisting surviving institutions with integrating acquired assets resulting from financial
failures. We believe that software sales will be the most at risk as far as discretionary
purchases that financial institutions may defer. However, software sales represent approximately
5% of our revenues and thus any decrease should not have a significant impact on our results of
operations. While we believe that we are well positioned to withstand the current financial
crisis, there are factors outside our control that might impact our operating results that we may
not be able to fully anticipate as to timing and severity, including but not limited to adverse
effects if banks are nationalized, continued global economic conditions worsening, causing further
slowdown in consumer spending and lending and the impact on our ability to access capital should
any or our lenders fail.

Critical Accounting Policies

The accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our
Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies require management to make estimates, judgments
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures with
respect to contingent liabilities and assets at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts
could differ from those estimates. See Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that have been followed in
preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

The Company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing and credit and debit card
processing services, professional services, software licensing and software related services and
products. Revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred,
fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable. Occasionally, we are party
to multiple concurrent contracts with the same customer. These situations require judgment to
determine whether the individual contracts should be aggregated or evaluated separately for
purposes of revenue recognition. In making this determination we consider the timing of
negotiating and executing the contracts, whether the different elements of the contracts are
interdependent and whether any of the payment terms of the contracts are interrelated. Due to the
large number, broad nature and average size of individual



contracts we are party to, the impact of judgements and assumptions that we apply in
recognizing revenue for any single contract is not likely to have a material effect on our
consolidated operations or financial position. However the broader accounting policy assumptions
that we apply across similar arrangements or classes of customers could significantly influence the
timing and amount of revenue recognized in our historical and future results of operations or
financial position. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in
Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company analyzes trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts, customer
creditworthiness, current economic trends, changes in customer payment terms and collection trends
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Any change in the assumptions
used in analyzing a specific account receivable may result in an additional allowance for doubtful
accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs. The allowance for doubtful
accounts was $40.6 million and $53.4 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts from 2007 is primarily related to the LPS spin-off.

Reserves for Check Guarantee Losses

In our check guarantee business, if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant customer is
dishonored by the check writer’s bank, we reimburse our merchant customer for the check’s face
value and pursue collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer. Loss reserves and
anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of our check
loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect that experience in the
future. Such factors include the general economy, the overall industry mix of our customer volumes,
statistical analysis of check fraud trends within our customer volumes, and the quality of returned
checks. Once these factors are considered, we establish a rate for check losses that is calculated
by dividing the expected check losses by dollar volume processed and a rate for anticipated
recoveries that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by the total amount of related
check losses. These rates are then applied against the dollar volume processed and check losses,
respectively, each month and charged to costs of revenues. The estimated check returns and recovery
amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered may be different than our
estimates.

Historically, such estimation processes have proven to be materially accurate; however, our
projections of probable check guarantee losses and anticipated recoveries are inherently uncertain,
and as a result, we cannot predict with certainty the amount of such items. Changes in economic
conditions, the risk characteristics and composition of our customers, and other factors could
impact our actual and projected amounts. We recorded check guarantee losses, net of anticipated
recoveries excluding service fees, of $98.1 million and $113.8 million, respectively, for the years
ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. A ten percent difference in our estimated gross check guarantee
losses and our estimated recoveries as of December 31, 2008 could impact 2008 net earnings by
approximately $2.2 million after-tax.

Computer Software

Computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations,
purchased software and capitalized software development costs. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
computer software, net of accumulated amortization, was $617.0 million and $775.2 million,
respectively. Purchased software is recorded at cost and amortized using the straight line method
over its estimated useful life and software acquired in business combinations is recorded at its
fair value and amortized using straight line and accelerated methods over their estimated useful
lives, ranging from 3 to 10 years. In determining useful lives, management considers historical
results and technological trends which may influence the estimate. Amortization expense for
computer software was $149.9 million, $177.8 million and $130.2 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Included in discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in
those years was amortization expense on computer software of $14.8 million, $32.5 million, and
$30.2 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We also assess the recorded value of computer
software for impairment on a regular basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated future
cash flows to be generated by the underlying software asset. There are inherent uncertainties in
determining the expected useful life or cash flows to be generated from computer software. While
we have not historically experienced significant changes in these estimates we could be subject to
such changes in the future.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to
determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, are complex and require a
significant amount of management judgment. We generally engage independent valuation specialists to
assist us in making fair value determinations. We are also required to estimate the useful lives
of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization
expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives



assigned to
our definite-lived intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to
be appropriate. Additionally we review our indefinite lived intangible assets to determine if there is any
change in circumstances that may indicate the asset’s useful life is no longer indefinite.

We review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment
annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS 142”).
SFAS 142 requires us to perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. First, we compare the fair
value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of our reporting
units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of a reporting
unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit’s net assets, goodwill is not impaired and further
testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the fair
value of the unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied
fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and any impairment charge. Additionally, we estimate
the fair value of acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives and compare this amount to the
underlying carrying value.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or acquired intangible assets with indefinite
lives involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include
assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated
future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions and other
assumptions. During the fourth quarter of 2008, immediately prior to our annual measurement date
for impairment testing, our market capitalization declined to a point below our book value. Our
annual impairment test indicated that no impairment has occurred, based on our assumptions of
discounted future cash flows using our current best estimate of future performance. In December of
2008, upon the change in our reporting segments and in light of the fact that our market
capitalization continued to remain below our book value, we performed new impairment tests on a
segment basis and determined that no impairments existed.

The Company has reconciled the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting
units to the market capitalization of the consolidated Company. We believe that the overall market conditions that existed at the measurement
dates and continue to exist because of the financial crisis have led
to a market capitalization well below the fair value of a controlling
interest. Based on these factors, we concluded that the market capitalization does
not represent the fair value of the Company.

Our analysis of indefinite lived intangible assets did indicate an impairment of our check
trademark. Accordingly we recorded a charge of $52.0 million to reduce the intangible asset’s
carrying value to fair value (Note 11). Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible
asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could
be material to our financial statements

Accounting for Income Taxes

As part of the process of preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to
determine income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves
estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from
differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in
deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be recovered from
future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, establish a
valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in
a period, we must reflect this increase as an expense within income tax expense in the Statement of
Earnings. Determination of the income tax expense requires estimates and can involve complex issues
that may require an extended period to resolve. Further, changes in the geographic mix of revenues
or in the estimated level of annual pre-tax income can cause the overall effective income tax rate
to vary from period to period. We believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and
that we adequately provide for any known tax contingencies. We believe the estimates and
assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable. However,
final determination of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or
expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different than estimates reflected in
assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final
determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows
in the period that determination is made.

Related Party Transactions

We are a party to certain historical related party agreements with FNF, LPS and other related
parties (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this
Report).

Factors Affecting Comparability

Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report that present our financial
condition and operating results reflect the following significant transactions:



Although the legal entity that survived the Certegy Merger was Certegy (which has since been
renamed Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.), for accounting purposes, our historical
financial statements are those of FIS. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of
operations of Certegy from the date of the acquisition.

As a result of the above transactions, the results of operations in the periods covered by the
Consolidated Financial Statements may not be directly comparable.

Processing and Services Revenues

Processing and services revenues totaled $3,446.0 million, $2,921.0 million and $2,416.5
million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in revenue during 2008 of $525.0
million, or 18.0% as compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to the impact of the eFunds
acquisition, which contributed year over year incremental revenues of $396.3 million. Additionally
our Brazilian card processing venture, the “Brazilian Venture” had a year over year increase in
revenue of $87.7 million. The increase in revenue in 2007 of $504.5 million as compared to 2006 is
primarily attributable to revenue increases from the eFunds and Certegy acquisitions along with
organic growth. The eFunds acquisition contributed revenues of $166.6 million from its September
12, 2007 completion date through December 31, 2007 and the Certegy Merger contributed one
additional month of revenue in the 2007 period, or approximately $96.4 million, as compared to the
full year 2006. The Brazilian Venture contributed $49.2 million to revenue growth in 2007, with
other growth in international revenues comprising most of the year over year organic growth.

Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit

Cost of revenues totaled $2,636.9 million, $2,265.8 million and $1,872.2 million in 2008, 2007
and 2006, respectively, resulting in gross profit of $809.1 million, $655.2 million and $544.3
million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues (“gross
margin”) was 23.5%, 22.4% and 22.5% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in cost of
revenues of $371.1 million in the 2008 period as compared to the 2007 period is directly
attributable to revenue growth across our three operating segments. The increase in gross margin
of 1.1% for 2008 over 2007 was driven by the growth of higher product margin sales and gained
efficiencies relating to the integration of eFunds. The increase in cost of revenues of $393.6
million in the 2007 period as compared to the 2006 period was attributable to growth in our three
operating segments primarily driven by the eFunds acquisition. The gross margin decreased slightly
due to the costs associated with the eFunds acquisition including restructuring and integration as
well as increased amortization expense relating to purchased intangibles.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $389.4 million, $302.9 million and $279.8
million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase of $86.5 million in 2008 as compared to
2007 primarily relates to the incremental costs from the eFunds acquisition, as well as increased
stock compensation costs, additional restructuring and integration charges, and charges associated
with the LPS spin-off. Stock-based compensation increased from $24.9 million in 2007 to $51.6
million in 2008. The $26.7 million increase in stock-based compensation is mainly attributable to
charges of $14.1 million for the accelerated vesting of all stock awards held by eFunds employees
assumed in the eFunds acquisition and $2.6 million relating to the acceleration, upon termination,
of certain unvested executive stock awards. The remaining increase is attributable to $21.0
million of additional restructuring and integration charges and $9.3 million in charges associated
with the spin-off of LPS as compared to $6.0 million and $0.5 million respectively in 2007. The
increase of $23.1 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily resulted from the inclusion of
$15.2 million of expenses relating to eFunds since its acquisition date, as well as one additional
month of Certegy expenses.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs totaled $84.8 million, $70.4 million and $70.9 million for
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in research and development costs for 2008 as
compared to 2007 is primarily related to the eFunds acquisition.

Operating Income

Operating income totaled $334.9 million, $281.9 million and $193.6 million for 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively. Operating income as a percentage of revenue (“operating margin”) was 9.7%, 9.7%
and 8.0% for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in operating margin for 2007 as
compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to the increased revenues and achievement of expense
synergies relating to the Certegy Merger.



Interest Expense

Interest expense totaled $163.5 million, $190.2 million and $190.9 million for 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The decrease of $26.7 million in interest expense in 2008 as compared to 2007
is the result of a reduction of $1.6 billion in debt associated with the LPS spin-off on July 2,
2008 and the inclusion of $27.2 million in write-offs of capitalized debt issuance costs relating
to our prior credit facility during 2007, partially offset by the write-off of $12.4 million in
capitalized debt issuance costs associated with the Term Loan B retired in conjunction with the LPS
spin-off in 2008. Additionally, the impact of our interest rate swaps, which has effectively fixed
$2.1 billion of our debt at a rate of approximately 4.7%, offset the favorable decrease in
borrowing rates under our credit facility. The decrease in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily
the result of lower interest rates during 2007 partially offset by the inclusion of $27.2 million
in write-offs of capitalized debt issuance costs relating to our prior credit facility.

Provision for Income Taxes

Income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations totaled $57.6 million, $136.2 million
and ($2.9) million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This resulted in an effective tax rate on
continuing operations of 32.1%, 35.5% and (55.2%) for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
decrease in tax expense for the 2008 period as compared to the 2007 period is attributable to the
2007 period including the gain on sale of Covansys common stock and warrants, partially offset by
increased operating income in the 2008 period. The decrease in the 2008 overall effective tax rate
is primarily related to state tax benefits and benefits related to research and development
credits. The increase in tax expense for the 2007 period as compared to a tax benefit in 2006 is
attributable to the gain on sale of Covansys common stock and warrants and increased operating
income in the 2007 period. The 2006 year included certain favorable permanent book/tax differences
and proportionately higher foreign income taxed at overall lower rates.

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations

Net earnings from continuing operations totaled $117.4 million, $250.7 million and $15.6
million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, or $0.61, $1.28 and $0.08 per diluted share,
respectively. The decrease in net earnings in 2008 is primarily the result of 2007 including an
after tax gain of $172.9 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, from the sale of Covansys common
stock and warrants, partially offset by the inclusion of eFunds for the full year 2008 as compared
to the period from its acquisition date September 12, 2007 through December 31, 2007.

Revenues for the Financial Solutions segment totaled $1,158.8 million, $1,007.6 million and
$882.2 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The overall segment increase of $151.2
million in 2008 as compared to 2007 resulted primarily from the impact of the eFunds acquisition
that occurred on September 12, 2007 and organic growth within our existing business. Incremental
revenue from the eFunds acquisition contributed a year over year increase of $143.3 million. The
overall segment increase of $125.4 million for 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributable
to organic growth of 7.9% and incremental revenue from the eFunds acquisition of $56.1 million.

Operating income for the Financial Solutions segment totaled $355.1 million, $203.1 million
and $181.4 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin was approximately 31%,
20% and 21% for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in 2008 as compared to 2007
primarily resulted from increased operating margins due to targeted cost reductions coupled with
the relatively higher margin on the additional revenues from eFunds. The increase in 2007 as
compared to 2006 was primarily due to the eFunds acquisition.

million in 2008 as compared to 2007 resulted primarily from the impact of the eFunds acquisition,
which contributed year over year incremental revenue of $210.5 million. The overall segment
increase of $178.3 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 resulted principally from organic growth of
8.0% and year over year growth from the eFunds acquisition of $88.9 million.

Operating income for the Payment Solutions segment totaled $347.8 million, $291.8 million and
$253.9 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin was approximately 23% for
all three years, thus the year over year increases results from the margin on the incremental
revenues.

Revenues for the International segment totaled $759.5 million, $618.1 million and $430.3
million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The overall segment increase of $141.4 million in
2008 as compared to 2007 resulted principally from increased revenue in our Brazilian Venture
and incremental revenues due to the eFunds acquisition, partially offset by unfavorable currency
effects of $28.2 million. The Brazilian Venture had a year over year increase in revenues of
$87.7 million and the eFunds acquisition contributed year over year incremental revenue of $41.5
million. The overall segment increase of $187.8 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 was the result
of a $56.4 million increase in financial solutions revenue and a $131.4 million increase in payment
solutions revenue. The majority of the $56.4 million increase in financial solutions revenue was
due to organic growth, principally in Germany. Of the $131.4 million increase in payment solutions
revenue, $58.3 million was due to growth in credit cards principally due to growth in the Brazilian
Venture, $40.5 million was due to the addition of the BPO
business in Brazil, $8.9 million was
due to organic growth in other regions and $23.7 million was due to incremental revenue from the
eFunds acquisition.

Operating income for the International segment totaled $49.5 million, $44.7 million and $38.3
million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin was 7%, 7% and 9% for 2008, 2007
and 2006, respectively. The increase in operating income in 2008, as compared to 2007, as well as
2007 as compared to 2006, primarily results from margins on the incremental revenues.

Corporate and Other

The Corporate and Other segment results consist of selling, general and administrative
expenses and depreciation and intangible asset amortization not otherwise allocated to the
reportable segments. Corporate and Other expenses were $417.5 million, $257.7 million and $280.0
million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The overall Corporate and Other increase of $159.8
million for 2008 as compared to 2007 is attributable to the effect of incremental expenses related
to the eFunds acquisition, additional stock compensation expense, incremental restructuring and
integration charges and costs associated with the LPS spin-off. Stock-based compensation increased
from $24.9 million in 2007 to $51.6 million in 2008. The $26.7 million increase in stock-based
compensation is mainly attributable to charges of $14.1 million for the accelerated vesting of all
stock awards held by eFunds employees assumed in the eFunds acquisition and $2.6 million relating
to the acceleration, upon termination, of certain unvested executive stock awards. Intangible
asset amortization increased $46.6 million as compared to 2007 primarily relating to the eFunds
acquisition coupled with an impairment charge of $26.0 million related to a decline in the fair
value of the retail check guarantee business. Corporate expenses also include $21.0 million of
restructuring and integration charges and $9.3 million in costs associated with the LPS spin-off.

The overall corporate and other decrease of $22.3 million for 2007 as compared to 2006 is
primarily attributable to a decrease in administrative costs due to cost reduction targets related
to the integration of Certegy.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Requirements

Our cash requirements include cost of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses,
income taxes, debt service payments, capital expenditures, systems development expenditures,
stockholder dividends, and business acquisitions. Our principal sources of funds are cash generated
by operations and borrowings.

At December 31, 2008, we had cash on hand of $220.9 million and debt of approximately $2,514.5
million, including the current
portion. Of the $220.9 million cash on hand, approximately $139.8 million is held by our
operations in foreign jurisdictions. We



expect that cash flows from operations over the next twelve
months will be sufficient to fund our operating cash requirements and pay principal and interest on
our outstanding debt absent any unusual circumstances such as acquisitions or adverse changes in
the business environment.

We currently pay a $0.05 dividend on a quarterly basis, and expect to continue to do so in the
future. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Board of
Directors and depends on, among other things, our investment policy and opportunities, results of
operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors that may be
considered relevant by our Board of Directors, including legal and contractual restrictions.
Additionally, the payment of cash dividends may be limited by covenants in certain debt agreements.
A regular quarterly dividend of $0.05 per common share is payable March 30, 2009 to shareholders of
record as of the close of business on March 16, 2009.

Cash Flows from Operations

Cash
flows from operations were $596.4 million, $463.5 million and $494.7 million in 2008,
2007 and 2006 respectively. Included in the 2007 period cash flow from operations were payments of
$106.6 million of tax liability relating to the gain on Covansys and a $47.5 million reduction in
taxes payable due to stock option exercises. Included in 2006 cash flow from operations was a $26.9
million reduction in taxes payable due to stock option exercises.

Capital Expenditures

Our principal capital expenditures are for computer software (purchased and internally
developed) and additions to property and equipment. In 2008, we spent approximately $255.4 million
on capital expenditures, including approximately $25.0 million related to LPS prior to the
spin-off. In 2009 we expect to spend approximately 5% to 7% of 2009 revenue on capital
expenditures.

Financing

On January 18, 2007, we entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, and Letter of Credit Issuer, Bank of America, N.A., as
Swing Line Lender, and other financial institutions party thereto (the “Credit Agreement”). The
Credit Agreement replaced our prior term loans and revolver as well as a $100 million settlement
facility. As a result of the new credit agreement, we repaid the old credit agreement and recorded
a charge of $27.2 million to write-off unamortized capitalized debt issuance costs. The Credit
Agreement, which became secured as of September 12, 2007, provides for a committed $2.1 billion
five-year term facility denominated in U.S. Dollars (the “Term Loan A”) and a committed $900
million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Loan”) with a sublimit of $250 million for
letters of credit and a sublimit of $250 million for swing line loans, maturing on the fifth
anniversary of the closing date, January 18, 2012 (the “Maturity Date”). The Revolving Loan is
bifurcated into a $735 million multicurrency revolving credit loan (the “Multicurrency Tranche”)
that can be denominated in any combination of U.S. Dollars, Euro, British Pounds Sterling and
Australian Dollars, and any other foreign currency in which the relevant lenders agree to make
advances and a $165 million U.S. Dollar revolving credit loan that can be denominated only in U.S.
Dollars. The swingline loans and letters of credit are available as a sublimit under the
Multicurrency Tranche. In addition, the Credit Agreement originally provided for an uncommitted
incremental loan facility in the maximum principal amount of $600 million, which would be made
available only upon receipt of further commitments from lenders under the Credit Agreement
sufficient to fund the amount requested by us. On July 30, 2007, we, along with the requisite
lenders, executed an amendment to the existing Credit Agreement to facilitate our acquisition of
eFunds. The amendment permitted the issuance of up to $2.1 billion in additional loans, an increase
from the foregoing $600 million. The amendment became effective September 12, 2007. On September
12, 2007, we entered into a joinder agreement to obtain a secured $1.6 billion tranche of term
loans denominated in U.S. Dollars (the “Term Loan B”) under the Credit Agreement, utilizing $1.6
billion of the $2.1 billion uncommitted incremental loan amount. The Term Loan B proceeds were used
to finance the eFunds Acquisition, and pay related fees and expenses. On July 2, 2008, we completed
the spin-off of our former Lender Processing Services segment into a separate publicly traded
company, Lender Processing Services, Inc., referred to as LPS. In conjunction with the LPS
spin-off, we immediately retired the outstanding $1,585.0 million principal balance of the Term
Loan B. Debt issuance costs of $9.1 million are capitalized as of December 31, 2008. The $12.4
million remaining balance of Term Loan B debt issuance costs were written-off during July 2008 in
conjunction with the LPS spin-off and retirement of the Term Loan B.

As of December 31, 2008, the Term Loan A balance was $1,995.0 million and a total of $499.4
million was outstanding under the Revolving Loan. The obligations under the Credit Agreement have
been jointly and severally, unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries.
Additionally, we and certain subsidiary guarantors pledged certain equity interests in other
entities (including certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries) as collateral security for the
obligations under the credit facility and the guarantee.



We may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts under the Revolving Loan from time to time until
the maturity of the Revolving Loan. We must make quarterly principal payments under the Term Loan A
in scheduled installments of: (a) $13.1 million per quarter from June 30, 2007 through December 31,
2008; (b) $26.3 million per quarter from March 31, 2009 through December 31, 2009; and (c) $52.5
million per quarter from March 31, 2010 through September 30, 2011, with the remaining balance of
approximately $1.5 billion payable on the Maturity Date.

In addition to the scheduled principal payments, the Term Loan is (with certain exceptions)
subject to mandatory prepayment upon issuances of debt, casualty and condemnation events, and sales
of assets, as well as from a percentage of excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement)
between zero and fifty percent commencing with the cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2008.
No mandatory prepayments were owed for the year ended December 31, 2008. Voluntary prepayment of
the Loan is generally permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice and subject to a minimum
dollar requirement. Commitment reductions of the Revolving Loan are also permitted at any time
without fee upon proper notice. The Revolving Loan has no scheduled principal payments, but it will
be due and payable in full on the Maturity Date.

The outstanding balance on the Loans bears interest at a floating rate, which is an applicable
margin plus, at our option, either (a) the Eurocurrency (LIBOR) rate or (b) either (i) the federal
funds rate or (ii) the prime rate. The applicable margin is subject to adjustment based on a
leverage ratio (our total indebtedness to our consolidated total EBITDA in our consolidated
subsidiaries, as further defined in the Credit Agreement). Alternatively, we have the ability to
request the lenders to submit competitive bids for one or more advances under the Revolving Loan.

The Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for
financings of this type, including, among other things, limits on the creation of liens, limits on
the incurrence of indebtedness, restrictions on investments and dispositions, a prohibition on the
payment of dividends and other restricted payments if an event of default has occurred and is
continuing or would result therefrom, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage
ratio. Upon an event of default, the Administrative Agent can accelerate the maturity of the Loans.
Events of default include conditions customary for such an agreement, including failure to pay
principal and interest in a timely manner and breach of certain covenants. These events of default
include a cross-default provision that permits the lenders to declare the Credit Agreement in
default if (i) we fail to make any payment after the applicable grace period under any indebtedness
with a principal amount in excess of $150 million or (ii) we fail to perform any other term under
any such indebtedness, as a result of which the holders thereof may cause it to become due and
payable prior to its maturity. We were in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit
Agreement at December 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2008, we have entered into interest rate swap transactions converting a
portion of the interest rate exposure on our Term and Revolving Loans from variable to fixed (see
Item 7A).

FIS believes that its existing cash balances, cash flows from operations and borrowing
programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet FIS’ expected
short-term liquidity needs and its long-term needs for the operations of its business, expected
capital spending for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future and the satisfaction of these
obligations and commitments.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

FIS does not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements



In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP)
Emerging Issues Task Force 03-6-1,

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment
Transactions Are Participating Securities,

which will become effective for periods beginning on or
after December 15, 2008, and will be applied retrospectively. Under the FSP, unvested share-based
payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are
participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share (EPS)
pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method determines earnings per share for each class
of common stock and participating securities according to dividends or dividend equivalents and
their respective participation rights in undistributed earnings. Adoption of FSP Emerging Issues
Task Force 03-6-1 will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of
its operations.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162,

The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles

(“SFAS 162”). SFAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework
for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of
nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States. The FASB has concluded that the generally accepted accounting
principles hierarchy should reside in the accounting literature established by the FASB and issued
SFAS 162 to achieve that result. SFAS 162 was effective on November 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS
162 did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of its
operations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133.

(“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 expands the
current disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,

(“SFAS 133”) such that entities must now provide enhanced disclosures on a quarterly
basis regarding how and why the entity uses derivatives, how derivatives and related hedged items
are accounted for under SFAS 133, and how derivatives and related hedged items affect the entity’s
financial position, performance and cash flow. Pursuant to the transition provisions of the
Statement, the Company will adopt SFAS 161 in fiscal year 2009 and will present the required
disclosures in the prescribed format on a prospective basis. SFAS 161 will not impact the
consolidated financial results as it is disclosure-only in nature.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS 160”), requiring noncontrolling interests
(sometimes called minority interests) to be presented as a component of equity on the balance
sheet. SFAS 160 also requires that the amount of net earnings attributable to the parent and to the
noncontrolling interests be clearly identified and presented on the face of the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings. This Statement eliminates the need to apply purchase accounting when a
parent company acquires a noncontrolling ownership interest in a subsidiary and requires that, upon
deconsolidation of a subsidiary, a parent company recognize a gain or loss in net earnings after
which any retained noncontrolling interest will be reported at fair value. SFAS 160 requires
expanded disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements that identify and distinguish between
the interests of the parent’s owners and the interest of the noncontrolling owners of subsidiaries.
SFAS 160 is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and will be applied
prospectively except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will be applied
retrospectively for all periods presented. Adoption of SFAS 160 will not have a material effect on
the Company’s statements of operations. Upon adoption of SFAS
160 the non controlling or minority interest ($164.2 million at
December 31, 2008) will be reclassified to a component of equity.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS
141(R)”), requiring an acquirer in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values at the
acquisition date, with limited exceptions. The costs of the acquisition and any related
restructuring costs will be recognized separately. Assets and liabilities arising from
contingencies in a business combination are to be recognized at their fair value at the acquisition
date and adjusted prospectively as new information becomes available. When the fair value of assets
acquired exceeds the fair value of consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in
the acquiree, the excess will be recognized as a gain. Under SFAS 141(R), all business combinations
will be accounted for prospectively by applying the acquisition method, including combinations
among mutual entities and combinations by contract alone. SFAS 141(R) is effective for periods
beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and will apply to business combinations occurring after
the effective date. The Company will adopt SFAS 141R and apply its provisions to business
combinations subsequent to December 31, 2008.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”). SFAS
157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements by establishing a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs
used to measure fair value. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but applies
under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is
effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company
adopted SFAS 157 as of January 1, 2008. Items in our Consolidated Financial Statements for which
SFAS 157 is already effective are discussed in the Financing section of Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

In
February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position SFAS
No. 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB
Statement No. 157,

which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 with respect to nonfinancial assets
and nonfinancial liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis until
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Accordingly, the Company has not yet applied the



disclosure requirements of SFAS 157 to certain such nonfinancial assets for which fair value
measurements are determined on a non-recurring basis only when there is an indication of potential
impairment.

The fair value hierarchy established by SFAS 157 includes three levels which are based on the
priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest
priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure the financial
instruments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. In
accordance with SFAS 157, our financial assets and liabilities that are recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as
follows:

Level 1. Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for
identical assets or liabilities in an active market that we have the ability to access.

Level 2. Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that
are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for
substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

Level 3. Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on model inputs that are
unobservable.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks

Market Risk

We are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency
exchange rates. In managing exposure to these fluctuations, we may engage in various hedging
transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures. On a
limited basis, we use certain derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, to
manage these risks. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes, to generate income or to engage
in speculative activity. Our capital costs are directly linked to financial and business risks. We
seek to manage the potential negative effects from market volatility and market risk. It is our
policy to manage our debt structure in order to manage capital costs, control financial risks and
maintain financial flexibility over the long term.

Interest Rate Risk

We have issued debt in floating rate instruments. Interest rate swaps are used for the purpose
of controlling interest expense by managing the mix of fixed and floating rate debt. We do not seek
to make a profit from changes in interest rates. We manage interest rate sensitivity by measuring
potential increases in interest expense that would result from a probable change in interest rates.
When the potential increase in interest expense exceeds an acceptable amount, we reduce risk
through the purchase of derivatives.

As of December 31, 2008, we are paying interest on the Revolving Loan at LIBOR plus 0.70% and
at LIBOR plus 0.88% on our Term Loan A. A one percent increase in the LIBOR rate would increase our
annual debt service on the Credit Agreement by $3.9 million (based on principal amounts outstanding
at December 31, 2008, net of interest rate swaps). The credit rating assigned to FIS by Standard &
Poor’s was BB+ at December 31, 2008.

We have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions converting a portion of the
interest rate exposure on our Term and Revolving Loans from variable to fixed (in millions):

applicable margin to our bank lenders on the Term Loan A of 0.88% and
the Revolving Loan of 0.70% (plus a facility fee of 0.18%) as of
December 31, 2008.



We are subject to foreign exchange risk for foreign currency-denominated transactions, such as
debt issued, recognized payables and receivables and forecasted transactions. Changes in foreign
currency exchange rates also affect translations of revenues denominated in currencies other than
U.S. Dollars. Our international operations generated approximately $760.0 million in revenues in
2008, of which approximately $614.0 million was denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
Dollar. The major currencies that we are exposed to are the Brazilian Real, the Euro and the
British Pound Sterling. A 5% move in average exchange rates for these currencies would have had
the following effect on 2008 reported revenues:

In the future, we may enter into agreements to hedge our risks against foreign currency
movements, but historically we have not entered into any such agreements. However, any hedging
strategies may not be successful, and any future un-hedged foreign exchange payments could be
subject to market fluctuations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.:

We have audited Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.’s and subsidiaries’ (the
“Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Fidelity National Information
Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity, cash flows, and comprehensive earnings for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, and our
report dated February 27, 2009
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fidelity National Information
Services, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity, cash flows and comprehensive earnings
for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Fidelity National
Information Services, Inc. and
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.’s and subsidiaries’ internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

As
discussed in notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company completed a spin-off of its Lender Processing Services
segment on July 2, 2008.

FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Unless
stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires all references to “FIS,”

“we”,

the
“Company” or the “registrant” are to Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., a Georgia
corporation formerly known as Certegy Inc., which was the surviving legal entity in the Certegy
Merger; all references to “eFunds” are to eFunds Corporation, and its subsidiaries, as acquired by
FIS (Note 6); all references to “Old FNF” are to Fidelity National Financial, Inc., which owned a
majority of the Company’s shares through November 9, 2006; all references to “FNF” are to Fidelity
National Financial, Inc. (formerly known as Fidelity National Title Group, Inc. (“FNT”)), formerly
a subsidiary of Old FNF but now an independent company that remains a related entity from an
accounting perspective; and all references to “LPS” are to Lender Processing Services, Inc., a
former wholly owned subsidiary of FIS which was spun-off as a separate publicly traded company on
July 2, 2008 (note 4).

(1) Basis of Presentation

FIS is a leading provider of technology solutions, processing services, and information-based
services to the financial services industry. On February 1, 2006, the Company completed a merger
with Certegy (the “Certegy Merger”) (Note 6), which was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and
purchase accounting was applied to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Certegy. In form,
Certegy was the legal acquirer in the Certegy Merger and the continuing registrant for Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) reporting purposes. However, due to the majority ownership in
the combined entity held by FIS shareholders, FIS was designated the acquirer for accounting
purposes and, effective on the Certegy Merger date, the historical financial statements of FIS
became the historical financial statements of the continuing registrant for all periods prior to
the Certegy Merger. The results of operations of Certegy are only included in these historical
financial statements for periods subsequent to the Certegy Merger. Immediately after the Certegy
Merger, the name of the SEC registrant was changed to Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

On July 2, 2008, we completed the LPS spin-off. For accounting purposes the results of LPS
are presented as discontinued operations. Accordingly all prior
periods have been revised to
present the results of LPS up to July 1, 2008 as discontinued operations.

Subsequent to the LPS spin-off, we continued to operate under the historical operating segment
of Transaction Processing Services. During the 2008 fourth quarter we
performed a review and restructuring of our
organizational and management structure and redefined our reporting segments as presented in Note
20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2) Combination with Old FNF

On June 25, 2006, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “FNF Merger
Agreement”) with Old FNF (amended September 18, 2006) (the “FNF Merger”). The FNF Merger was one
step in a plan that eliminated Old FNF’s holding company structure and majority ownership of FIS.
In connection with this plan, Old FNF also entered into a securities exchange and distribution
agreement (the “SEDA”) with its subsidiary Fidelity National Title Group, Inc. (“FNT”). Under the
SEDA, Old FNF agreed that, prior to the merger, Old FNF would transfer substantially all its assets
and liabilities to FNT, in exchange for shares of FNT common stock. Old FNF then would spin-off all
shares of FNT stock it held to the stockholders of Old FNF in a tax-free distribution. Pursuant to
the FNF Merger Agreement, on November 9, 2006, Old FNF merged with and into FIS, with FIS
continuing as the surviving corporation. In consideration for the FNF Merger, Old FNF stockholders
received an aggregate of 96,521,877 shares of FIS stock for their Old FNF shares. In addition, in
connection with the FNF Merger, FIS issued options to purchase FIS common stock and shares of FIS
restricted stock in exchange for certain Old FNF options and restricted stock outstanding at the
time of the FNF Merger. The FNF Merger followed the completion, on October 24, 2006, of FNT’s
acquisition under the SEDA of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Old FNF (other
than Old FNF’s interests in FIS and in FNF Capital Leasing, Inc., a small subsidiary which merged
into FIS in a separate transaction) in exchange for 45,265,956 shares of FNT’s Class A common
stock, and Old FNF’s subsequent spin-off of its FNT shares (the “FNT Distribution”). Pursuant to
the SEDA and after the completion of all of the transactions, FNT was renamed Fidelity National
Financial, Inc. (“FNF”) and now trades under the symbol FNF. Old FNF Chairman and CEO William P.
Foley, II, assumed a similar position in FNF and now serves as its Chairman and as Executive
Chairman of FIS, and other key members of Old FNF senior management continued their involvement in
both FNF and FIS in executive capacities.

U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that one of the two parties to the FNF
Merger be designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. However, Financial Accounting
Standards Board Technical Bulletin 85-5,

Issues Relating to Accounting for Business Combinations

provides that if a transaction lacks substance, it is not a purchase event and should be accounted
for based on existing carrying amounts. In the FNF Merger, the minority interest of FIS has not
changed and the only assets and liabilities of the



combined entity after the exchange are those of FIS prior to the exchange. Because a change in
ownership of the minority interest did not take place, the FNF Merger has been accounted for based
on the carrying amounts of FIS’ assets and liabilities.

(3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The following describes the significant accounting policies of the Company which have been
followed in preparing the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

(a) Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of FIS, its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, and subsidiaries that are majority owned and/or over which it exercises substantive
control. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, in which FIS has 20 percent to 50 percent of
ownership interest and has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not substantive
control, over the affiliate’s operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity
method of accounting.

All significant intercompany profits, transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation. The financial information included herein does not necessarily reflect what the
financial position and results of operations of the Company would have been had it operated as a
stand-alone entity during the periods covered.

All dollar amounts presented in these notes and in the accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements (except per share amounts) are in millions unless indicated otherwise.

(b) Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of reporting balance sheets and cash flows, highly liquid instruments purchased
with original maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. The carrying
amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for these instruments approximate their fair
value. At December 31, 2008, we had cash on hand of
$220.9 million of which approximately $139.8
million is held by our operations in foreign jurisdictions.

(c) Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The
carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for
receivables and accounts payable approximate their fair values
because of their immediate or short-term maturities. The fair value
of the Company’s long-term debt at December 31, 2008 is
estimated to be approximately $502.0 million lower than the carrying
value (based on values of  trades of our debt made in
close proximity to year-end) and was estimated to approximate
carrying value at December 31, 2007. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve
uncertainties and significant judgment in the interpretation of current market data. Therefore, the
values presented are not necessarily indicative of amounts the Company could realize or settle
currently. The Company holds, or has held, certain derivative instruments, specifically interest
rate swaps and warrants relating to certain subsidiaries. As discussed in Note 15,
interest rate swaps were valued using Level 2-type measurements.

(d) Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,

(“SFAS 133”) as amended. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company engaged in hedging
activities relating to its variable rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps. The Company
designates these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. The estimated fair values of the cash
flow hedges are recorded as an asset or liability of the Company and are included in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in prepaid expenses and other current assets, other
non-current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other long-term liabilities, as
appropriate, and as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings, net of deferred taxes.
A portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is recorded in
interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the Company’s Term and
Revolving Loans (Note 15). The Company’s existing cash flow hedges are highly effective and there
is no current impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. It is our policy to execute such
instruments with credit-worthy banks at the time of execution and not to enter into derivative
financial instruments for speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2008, we believe that our
interest rate swap counterparties will be able to fulfill their obligations under our agreements.

The Company analyzes trade accounts receivable by considering historical bad debts, customer
creditworthiness, current economic trends, changes in customer payment terms and collection trends
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Any change in the assumptions
used in analyzing a specific account receivable may result in an additional allowance for doubtful
accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs.

Settlement Deposits, Receivables, and Payables.

The Company records settlement receivables
and payables that result from timing differences in the Company’s settlement process with
merchants, financial institutions, and credit card associations related to merchant and card
transaction processing and third-party check collections. Cash held by FIS associated with this
settlement process is classified as settlement deposits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(f) Other receivables

Other receivables represent amounts due from consumers related to deferred debit processing
services offered in Australia and the U.K., and other amounts
including income taxes receivable. A
significant portion of the amounts due from consumers related to deferred debit processing services
relate to Certegy Australia, Ltd., which was sold on October 13, 2008. The carrying value for
these receivables was $81.7 million at December 31, 2008 and approximates their fair value.

(g) Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired
and liabilities assumed in business combinations. SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

(“SFAS No. 142”) requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over
their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and be reviewed for
impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets

(“SFAS No. 144”). SFAS No. 142 and SFAS No. 144 also provide that goodwill and other
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized, but shall be tested for
impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment, through a
comparison of fair value to their carrying amounts. The Company measures for impairment on an
annual basis during the fourth quarter using a September 30th measurement date unless circumstances
require a more frequent measurement. During the third quarter of 2008, our market capitalization declined to a point below
our book value. However, our impairment test indicated that no
impairment had occurred, based on our
assumptions of discounted future cash flows using our current best estimate of future performance.
In December of 2008, upon the change in our reporting segments and in light of the fact that our
market capitalization continued to remain below our book value, we performed new impairment tests
on a segment basis and determined that no impairments existed.

The Company has reconciled the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting
units to the market capitalization of the consolidated Company. We believe that the overall market conditions that existed at the measurement
dates and continue to exist because of the financial crisis have led
to a market capitalization well below the fair value of a controlling
interest.



Based on these factors, we concluded that the market capitalization does not
represent the fair value of the Company.

(h) Long-lived Assets

SFAS No. 144 requires that long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite useful lives
be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured
by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated
future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of
the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.

(i) Intangible Assets

The Company has intangible assets which consist primarily of customer relationships that are
recorded in connection with acquisitions at their fair value based on the results of valuation
analysis. Customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an
accelerated method which takes into consideration expected customer attrition rates up to a
ten-year period. Intangible assets with estimated useful lives (principally customer relationships
and certain trademarks) are reviewed for impairment in accordance
with SFAS No. 144 while certain trademarks determined to have indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually in
accordance with SFAS No. 142.

(j) Computer Software

Computer software includes the fair value of software acquired in business combinations,
purchased software and capitalized software development costs. Purchased software is recorded at
cost and amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life and software
acquired in business combinations is recorded at its fair value and amortized using straight-line
or accelerated methods over its estimated useful life, ranging from five to ten years.

Capitalized software development costs are accounted for in accordance with either SFAS No.
86,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed

(“SFAS
No. 86”), or with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) Statement of
Position (“SOP”) No. 98-1,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use

(“SOP 98-1”). After the technological feasibility of the software has been established
(for SFAS No. 86 software), or at the beginning of application development (for SOP No. 98-1
software), software development costs, which include salaries and related payroll costs and costs
of independent contractors incurred during development, are capitalized. Research and development
costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility (for SFAS No. 86 software),
or prior to application development (for SOP No. 98-1 software), are expensed as incurred. Software
development costs are amortized on a product by product basis commencing on the date of general
release of the products (for SFAS No. 86 software) and the date placed in service for purchased
software (for SOP No. 98-1 software). Software development costs (for SFAS No. 86 software) are
amortized using the greater of (1) the straight-line method over its estimated useful life, which
ranges from three to ten years or (2) the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenue
over its useful life.

(k) Deferred Contract Costs

Cost of software sales and outsourced data processing and application management arrangements,
including costs incurred for bid and proposal activities, are generally expensed as incurred.
However, certain costs incurred upon initiation of a contract are deferred and expensed over the
contract life. These costs represent incremental external costs or certain specific internal costs
that are directly related to the contract acquisition or transition activities and are primarily
associated with installation of systems/processes and data conversion.

In the event indications exist that a deferred contract cost balance related to a particular
contract may be impaired, undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its
remaining term and compared to the unamortized deferred contract cost balance. If the projected
cash flows are not adequate to recover the unamortized cost balance, the balance would be adjusted
to equal the contract’s net realizable value, including any termination fees provided for under the
contract, in the period such a determination is made.

(l) Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation and amortization are computed primarily using the straight-line method based on the
estimated useful lives of the related assets: thirty years for buildings and three to seven years
for furniture, fixtures and computer equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the
straight-line method over the lesser of the initial term of the applicable lease or the estimated
useful lives of such assets.



(m) Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences
between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities and
expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The impact
on deferred income taxes of changes in tax rates and laws, if any, is reflected in the Consolidated
Financial Statements in the period enacted.

(n) Revenue Recognition

The Company generates revenues from the delivery of bank processing and credit and debit card
processing services, professional services, software licensing and software related services and
products. The Company recognizes revenues in accordance with accounting standards for software and
service companies including American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of
Position (SOP) 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

(SOP 97-2), as amended by SOP 98-9,

Modification
of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions

, (“SOP 98-9”) the
consensus reached in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-3,

Application of AICPA
Statement of Position 97-2 to Arrangements that Include the Right to Use Software Stored on Another
Entity’s Hardware

, the consensus reached in EITF Issue No. 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables

, SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

, and SOP 81-1,

Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts

, and related
interpretations, including AICPA Technical Practice Aids. The Company recognizes revenue when:
(i) evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred;
(iii) the fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is considered probable.

The following describes the Company’s primary types of revenues and its revenue recognition
policies as they pertain to the types of transactions the Company enters into with its customers.
The Company enters into arrangements with customers to provide services, software and software
related services such as post-contract customer support and implementation and training either
individually or as part of an integrated offering of multiple services. These services occasionally
include offerings from more than one segment to the same customer. The revenues for services
provided under these multiple element arrangements are recognized in accordance with the applicable
revenue recognition accounting principles as further described below.

Bank Processing and Credit and Debit Card Processing Services

Bank processing and credit and debit card processing services include data processing and
application management. In some cases, these services are offered in combination with one another
and in other cases the Company offers them individually. Revenues from processing services are
typically volume-based depending on factors such as the number of accounts processed, transactions
processed and computer resources utilized. Revenues from these arrangements are recognized as
services are performed in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (“SAB 104”),

Revenue Recognition

and related interpretations.

In the event that the Company’s arrangements with its customers include more than one service,
the Company determines whether the individual revenue elements can be recognized separately in
accordance with EITF 00-21. EITF 00-21 addresses the
determination of whether an arrangement involving more than one deliverable contains more than one
unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the
separate units of accounting. In accordance with EITF 00-21, an element of an arrangement
containing more than one deliverable is considered a separate unit of accounting if all the
following criteria are met: the item has value to a customer on a standalone basis; there is
objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the item; and, if the arrangement includes a
general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the item is
considered probable and substantially in the Company’s control.

A relatively small percentage of credit card processing revenue is generated from the merchant
institution processing business, where the relationship is with the financial institution that
contracts directly with the merchant. In this business, the Company is responsible for collecting
and settling interchange fees with the credit card associations. The Company follows the guidance
provided



in EITF 99-19,

Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent,

(“EITF 99-19”)
which states that whether a company should recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a
customer or the net amount retained is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and
circumstances and that certain factors or indicators should be considered in the evaluation. The
Company has evaluated the indicators and records the interchange fees revenue on a gross basis and
the related costs are included in cost of revenue as the Company is considered the primary obligor
and bears credit risk associated with the transactions.

Professional Service Revenues

Revenues and costs related to implementation, conversion and programming services associated
with the Company’s data processing and application management agreements during the implementation
phase are deferred and subsequently recognized using the straight-line method over the term of the
related services agreement. The Company evaluates these deferred contract costs for impairment in
the event any indications of impairment exist.

Revenues and costs related to consulting service agreements, which include implementation,
conversion and programming services, are recognized as the services are provided in accordance with
SAB 104.

License and Software Related Revenues

The Company recognizes software license and post-contract customer support fees as well as
associated development, implementation, training, conversion and programming fees in accordance
with SOP No. 97-2 and SOP No. 98-9. Initial license fees are recognized when a contract exists, the
fee is fixed or determinable, software delivery has occurred and collection of the receivable is
deemed probable, provided that vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) has been established for
each element or for any undelivered elements. The Company determines the fair value of each element
or the undelivered elements in multi-element software arrangements based on VSOE. VSOE for each
element is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately, or in the case of
post-contract customer support, when a stated renewal rate is provided to the customer. If evidence
of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more
delivered elements, then revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual
method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the
arrangement fee is recognized as revenue. If evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more
undelivered elements of a contract, then all revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered
or fair value is determined for all remaining undelivered elements. Revenue from post-contract
customer support is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. The Company records deferred
revenue for all billings invoiced prior to revenue recognition.

With respect to a small percentage of revenues, the Company uses contract accounting, as
required by SOP No. 97-2, when the arrangement with the customer includes significant
customization, modification, or production of software. For elements accounted for under contract
accounting, revenue is recognized in accordance with SOP 81-1,

Accounting for Performance of
Construction Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts,

using the percentage-of-completion method
since reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and contract hours applicable to various elements
of a contract can be made. Revenues in excess of billings on these agreements are recorded as
unbilled receivables and are included in trade receivables. Billings in excess of revenue
recognized on these agreements are recorded as deferred revenue until revenue recognition criteria
are met. Changes in estimates for revenues, costs and profits are recognized in the period in which
they are determinable. When the Company’s estimates indicate that the entire contract will be
performed at a loss, a provision for the entire loss is recorded in that accounting period.

In arrangements where the licensed software includes hosting the software for the customer, a
software element is only considered present if the customer has the contractual right to take
possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it
is feasible for the customer to either operate the software on their own hardware or contract with
another vendor to host the software. If the arrangement meets these criteria, as well as the other
criteria for recognition of the license revenues described above, a software element is present and
license revenues are recognized when the software is delivered and hosting revenues are recognized
as the service is provided. If a separate software element described above is not present, the
related revenues are combined and recognized ratably over the hosting or maintenance period,
whichever is longer.

Hardware revenue is recognized as a delivered element in accordance with SOP No. 97-2 and SOP
No. 98-9 as discussed above. The Company does not stock in inventory the hardware products sold,
but arranges for delivery of hardware from third-party suppliers. For these transactions, the
Company follows the guidance provided in EITF No. 99-19. The Company has evaluated the indicators
and records the revenue related to hardware transactions on a gross basis and the related costs are
included in cost of revenue as the Company is considered the primary obligor by the customer, bears
risk of loss, and has latitude in establishing prices on the equipment.



(o) Cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses

Cost of revenue includes payroll, employee benefits, occupancy costs and other costs
associated with personnel employed in customer service roles, including program design and
development and professional services. Cost of revenue also includes data processing costs,
amortization of software, customer relationship intangible assets and depreciation on operating
assets.

Selling, general and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, occupancy and
other costs associated with personnel employed in sales, marketing, human resources and finance
roles. Selling, general and administrative expenses also includes depreciation on non-operating
corporate assets, advertising costs and other marketing-related programs.

(p) Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation plans using the fair value method. Using the
fair value method of accounting, compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the award
at the grant date and recognized over the service period.

(q) Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency for the foreign operations of the Company is either the U.S. Dollar or
the local currency. For foreign operations where the local currency is the functional currency, the
translation of foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using
exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a
weighted average exchange rate during the period. The gains and losses resulting from the
translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) in the Consolidated
Statements of Stockholders’ Equity and are excluded from net earnings. Realized gains or losses
resulting from other foreign currency transactions are included in other income.

(r) Management Estimates

The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(s) Check Guarantee Reserves

In the Company’s check guarantee business, if a guaranteed check presented to a merchant
customer is dishonored by the check writer’s bank, the Company reimburses the merchant customer for
the check’s face value and pursues collection of the amount from the delinquent check writer. Loss
reserves and anticipated recoveries are primarily determined by performing a historical analysis of
the Company’s check loss and recovery experience and considering other factors that could affect
that experience in the future. Such factors include the general economy, the overall industry mix
of customer volumes, statistical analysis of check fraud trends within customer volumes, and the
quality of returned checks. Once these factors are considered, the Company establishes a rate for
check losses that is calculated by dividing the expected check losses by dollar volume processed
and a rate for anticipated recoveries that is calculated by dividing the anticipated recoveries by
the total amount of related check losses. These rates are then applied against the dollar volume
processed and check losses, respectively, each month and charged to cost of revenue. The estimated
check returns and recovery amounts are subject to risk that actual amounts returned and recovered
may be different than the Company’s estimates. The Company had accrued claims payable balances of
$21.0 million and $27.4 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to these
estimations. The Company had accrued claims recoverable of $24.0 million and $37.5 million at
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to these estimations. In addition, the Company
recorded check guarantee losses, net of anticipated recoveries excluding service fees, of $98.1
million, $113.8 million and $102.9 million for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The amount
paid to merchant customers, net of amounts recovered from check writers excluding service fees, was
$87.4 million, $112.0 million and $107.9 million for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

(t) Net Earnings per Share

The basic weighted average shares and common stock equivalents determined using the treasury
stock method for the year ended December 31, 2006 include the shares and options that were
previously outstanding at Certegy only from February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. If these
shares and options had been outstanding for the entire twelve months of 2006, basic weighted
average shares outstanding would have been approximately 191.3 million, common stock equivalents
would have been 3.3 million and weighted average shares on a diluted basis would have been 194.6
million.

Net earnings and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
are as follows (in millions, except

(u) Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP)
Emerging Issues Task Force 03-6-1,

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment
Transactions Are Participating Securities,

which will become effective for periods beginning on or
after December 15, 2008, and will be applied retrospectively. Under the FSP, unvested share-based
payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are
participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share (EPS)
pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method determines earnings per share for each class
of common stock and participating securities according to dividends or dividend equivalents and
their respective participation rights in undistributed earnings. Adoption of FSP Emerging Issues
Task Force 03-6-1 will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of
its operations.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162,

The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles

(“SFAS 162”). SFAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework
for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of
nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States. The FASB has concluded that the generally accepted accounting
principles hierarchy should reside in the accounting literature established by the FASB and issued
SFAS 162 to achieve that result. SFAS 162 was effective on November 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS
162 did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of its
operations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133.

(“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 expands the
current disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,”

(“SFAS 133”) such that entities must now provide enhanced disclosures on a quarterly
basis regarding how and why the entity uses derivatives; how derivatives and related hedged items
are accounted for under SFAS 133, and how derivatives and related hedged items affect the entity’s
financial position, performance and cash flow. Pursuant to the transition provisions of the
Statement, the Company will adopt SFAS 161 in fiscal year 2009 and will present the required
disclosures in the prescribed format on a prospective basis. SFAS 161 will not impact the
consolidated financial results as it is disclosure-only in nature.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS 160”), requiring noncontrolling interests
(sometimes called minority interests) to be presented as a component of equity on the balance
sheet. SFAS 160 also requires that the amount of net earnings attributable to the parent and to the
noncontrolling interests be clearly identified and presented on the face of the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings. This Statement eliminates the need to apply purchase accounting when a
parent company acquires a noncontrolling ownership interest in a subsidiary and requires that, upon
deconsolidation of a subsidiary, a parent company recognize a gain or loss in net earnings after
which any retained noncontrolling interest will be reported at fair value. SFAS 160 requires
expanded disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements that identify and distinguish between
the interests of the parent’s owners and the interest of the noncontrolling owners of subsidiaries.
SFAS 160 is effective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and will be applied
prospectively except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will be applied
retrospectively for all periods presented. Adoption of SFAS 160



will not have a material effect on the Company’s statements of operations. Upon adoption of SFAS
160, the noncontrolling or minority interest, $164.2 million at December 31, 2008, will be
reclassified to a component of equity.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS
141(R)”), requiring an acquirer in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values at the
acquisition date, with limited exceptions. The costs of the acquisition and any related
restructuring costs will be recognized separately. Assets and liabilities arising from
contingencies in a business combination are to be recognized at their fair value at the acquisition
date and adjusted prospectively as new information becomes available. When the fair value of assets
acquired exceeds the fair value of consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in
the acquiree, the excess will be recognized as a gain. Under SFAS 141(R), all business combinations
will be accounted for prospectively by applying the acquisition method, including combinations
among mutual entities and combinations by contract alone. SFAS 141(R) is effective for periods
beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and will apply to business combinations occurring after
the effective date. The Company will adopt SFAS 141R and apply its provisions to business
combinations subsequent to December 31, 2008.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”). SFAS
157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements by establishing a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs
used to measure fair value. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but applies
under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is
effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company
adopted SFAS 157 as of January 1, 2008.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB
Statement No. 157,” which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 with respect to nonfinancial
assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis
until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Accordingly, the Company has not yet applied
the disclosure requirements of SFAS 157 to certain such nonfinancial assets for which fair value
measurements are determined on a non-recurring basis.

The fair value hierarchy established by SFAS 157 includes three levels which are based on the
priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest
priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure the financial
instruments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. In
accordance with SFAS 157, our financial assets and liabilities that are recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as
follows:

Level 1. Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for
identical assets or liabilities in an active market that we have the ability to access.

are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for
substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

(v) Certain Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made in the 2007 and 2006 Consolidated Financial
Statements to conform to the classifications used in 2008.

(4) Discontinued Operations

During 2008 and 2007, we discontinued certain operations which are reported as discontinued
operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
and 2006, in accordance with SFAS 144. Interest is allocated to discontinued operations based on
debt to be retired and debt specifically identified as related to the respective discontinued
operation.

LPS

On July 2, 2008 (the “spin-off date”), all of the shares of the common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of LPS, previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of FIS, were distributed to FIS
shareholders through a stock dividend (the “spin-off”). FIS and LPS are distinct and unique
businesses that serve different customers, operate in different markets, and attract different
investors. The spin-off allows us to provide more flexibility and dedicated management focus with
respect to our product development, capital investment and strategic initiatives. At the time of
the distribution, LPS consisted of substantially all the assets, liabilities, businesses and



employees related to FIS’ Lender Processing Services segment as of the spin-off date. In the
spin-off, FIS contributed all of its interest in such assets, liabilities, businesses and employees
to LPS in exchange for shares of LPS common stock and $1,585.0 million aggregate principal amount
of LPS debt obligations, which we used to retire our $1,585.0 Term Loan B. Upon the distribution,
FIS shareholders received one-half share of LPS common stock for every share of FIS common stock
held as of the close of business on June 24, 2008. FIS’ shareholders collectively received 100% of
the LPS common stock, which became a stand-alone public company trading under the symbol “LPS” on
the New York Stock Exchange. The results of operations of the former Lender Processing Services
segment of FIS are reflected as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings
for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, in accordance with SFAS 144.

LPS had revenues of $913.1 million, $1,686.6 million and $1,492.3 million for the period from
January 1, 2008 through July 2, 2008, and for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. LPS had earnings before taxes of $188.4 million, $412.3 million and $356.7 million
for the period from January 1, 2008 through July 2, 2008 and for the years ended December 31, 2007
and 2006, respectively.

Certegy Australia, Ltd.

On October 13, 2008, we sold Certegy Australia, Ltd. (“Certegy Australia”) for $21.1 million
in cash and other consideration, because its operations did not align with our strategic plans.
Certegy Australia had revenues of $27.6 million, $29.1 million and $21.0 million during the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Certegy
Australia had (loss) earnings before taxes
of ($17.6) million (including $26.0 million of trademark
impairment charge as discussed below), $15.7 million and $9.1 million
during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During the year ended
December 31, 2008, in accordance with SFAS 142, as defined in Note 3(g) we recorded a pre-tax
impairment charge of $52.0 million to reduce the carrying value of a trademark related to the
Company’s retail check business to its estimated fair value. We estimated the fair value of the
check trademark by utilizing a relief from royalty methodology. Under this method, we estimate the
amount of cash flows that, without owning the trademark, we would have had to pay to license the
trademark. These estimated cash flows were then discounted to determine the fair value.
Additionally, the trademark, previously accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset, was
determined to no longer be indefinite and has an estimated useful life of 15 years and is being
amortized straight line over its remaining life. Approximately $26.0 million of this charge is
included in cost of revenues in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the Corporate and Other
segment and $26.0 million (approximately $17.7 million net of tax) is included in discontinued
operations in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings, as a portion of the charge relates to the
Company’s Australian retail check business disposed of in fiscal year 2008 and accounted for as a
discontinued operation pursuant to SFAS 144.

Certegy Gaming Services

On April 1, 2008, we sold Certegy Gaming Services, Inc. (“Certegy Game”) for $25.0 million,
realizing a pretax loss of $4.1 million, because its operations did not align with our strategic
plans. Certegy Game had revenues of $27.2 million, $96.4 million and $82.4 million during the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Certegy Game had (losses) earnings before
taxes of $0.3 million (excluding the pretax loss realized on sale), ($1.1) million and $0.7
million during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

FIS Credit Services

On February 29, 2008, we sold FIS Credit Services, Inc. (“Credit”) for $6.0 million, realizing
a pre-tax gain of $1.4 million, because its operations did not align with our strategic plans.
Credit had revenues of $1.4 million, $12.4 million and $17.5 million



during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Credit had losses before
taxes of ($0.2) million (excluding the realized gain), $2.1 million and $0.6 million during the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Homebuilders Financial Network

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we discontinued and dissolved Homebuilders Financial
Network, LLC and its related entities (“HFN”) due to the loss of a major customer. HFN had revenues
of $1.4 million, $12.5 million and $12.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively. HFN had earnings (losses) before taxes of ($4.7) million, $3.5 million and $3.5
million during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Property Insight

On August 31, 2007, we sold Property Insight, LLC (“Property Insight”) to FNF for $95.0
million in cash realizing a pre-tax gain of $66.9 million ($42.1 million after-tax), because its
operations did not align with our strategic plans. Property Insight had revenues of $52.6 million
and $90.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Property Insight
had earnings before taxes of $13.7 million (excluding the realized gain) and $29.1 million during
the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

ABN AMRO Real and Banco Bradesco S.A.

In March 2006 we entered into an agreement with Banco Bradesco S.A. (“Bradesco”) and ABN AMRO
Real (“ABN”) (collectively, “banks”) to form a venture to provide comprehensive, fully outsourced
card processing services to Brazilian card issuers. In exchange for a 51% controlling interest in
the venture, we contributed our existing Brazilian card processing business contracts and Brazilian
card processing infrastructure and committed to make enhancements to our card processing system to
meet the processing needs of the banks and their affiliates. The banks executed long-term,
exclusive contracts to process their card portfolios with the venture in exchange for an aggregate
49% interest in the venture (Note 7). Additionally, we provide payment solutions services to
Bradesco and ABN AMRO outside of the Brazilian card processing venture.

Sedgwick

We also provide data processing services to Sedgwick CMS, Inc. (“Sedgwick”), a company in
which FNF holds an approximate 32% equity interest.

FNF and LPS

We have historically conducted business with FNF and its subsidiaries. A number of these
business activities were based upon agreements between FNF and entities which were a part of our
Lender Processing Services segment, which is now being presented as a discontinued operation in our
consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented. In connection with the July 2, 2008
LPS spin-off, a number of these agreements were amended, assigned or renegotiated by FIS, FNF and
LPS. A summary of the revenue producing agreements to which we are a party that were in effect as
of December 31, 2008 is as follows:

•

Data processing services.

This agreement governs IT support
services provided to FNF, consisting primarily of infrastructure support and data center
management. Subject to certain early termination provisions (including the payment of
minimum monthly service and termination fees), this agreement had an initial term of five
years



from February 2006 with an option to renew for one or two additional years. In connection
with the spin-off, this agreement was amended to cover these services through June 30,
2013.

•

Other services revenue.

These revenues relate to transitional services provided to LPS.

We entered into service agreements with FNF and LPS to provide certain services to us and them. A
summary of these agreements in effect as of December 31, 2008 is as follows:

•

Equipment and real estate leasing agreements.

We have
entered into certain property management and real estate lease agreements with LPS and FNF
relating to our Jacksonville corporate headquarters. We also incurred expenses for amounts
paid by us to FNF under leases of certain personal property and technology equipment.

•

Administrative corporate support services to and from FNF and LPS.

Historically, FNF has
provided to us, and to a lesser extent we have provided to FNF, certain administrative
corporate support services relating to general management, statutory accounting, claims
administration, and other administrative support services. The pricing for these services,
both to and from FNF, is at cost. The term of the corporate services agreements was two
years, subject to early termination if the services are no longer required by the party
receiving the services or upon mutual agreement of the parties and subject to extension in
certain circumstances. In connection with the LPS spin-off, we amended the corporate
services agreement to reduce the administrative corporate support services provided by FNF.
We also terminated the corporate services that we provide to FNF since such services are no
longer required by FNF. In addition, prior to the spin-off, we provided general management,
accounting, treasury, payroll, human resources, internal audit, and other corporate
administrative support services to LPS. In connection with the spin-off, we entered into
corporate services agreements with LPS under which we will provide to LPS, and we receive
from LPS, certain transitional corporate support services. The pricing for all of these
services, both from FNF, and from and to LPS, is at cost. The term of each of the corporate
services agreements is two years, subject to early termination if the services are no
longer required by the party receiving the services or upon mutual agreement of the parties
and subject to extension in certain circumstances.

We believe the amounts earned from or charged by us under each of the foregoing service
arrangements are fair and reasonable. We believe our service arrangements are priced within the
range of prices we offer to third parties. However, the amounts we earned or that were charged
under these arrangements were not negotiated at arm’s-length, and may not represent the terms that
we might have obtained from an unrelated third party.

Discontinued Operations — Related Party Activity

On August 31, 2007, we completed the sale of Property Insight to FNF. The net earnings
from Property Insight, including related party revenues and expenses, are classified as earnings
from discontinued operations for the period from January 1, 2007 through August 31, 2007 and the
year ended December 31, 2006.

Through July 2, 2008, LPS provided a number of services to FNF that are now presented as
discontinued operations. These services included title agency services, software development
services, real estate related services and other cost sharing services. These activities are
included within net earnings from discontinued operations.

FNF Capital

On October 26, 2006, we completed a merger with FNF Capital, Inc. (“FNF Capital”), a
leasing subsidiary of Old FNF. Through the merger, we assumed a note payable to Old FNF of
$13.9 million and we recorded interest expense related to this note of $0.6 million and
$0.2 million through September 30, 2007 and for the year ended December 31, 2006, respectively. On
September 30, 2007, we sold certain leasing assets of FNF Capital back to FNF for $15.0 million and
FNF assumed the aforementioned note payable and other liabilities. We also recorded a $7.3 million
note receivable from FNF relating to the transaction, which matures in September 2012, with
interest payable at a rate of LIBOR plus 0.45% (4.50% as of December 31, 2008). We recorded
interest income related to this note of $0.1 million for the period from October 1, 2007 through
December 31, 2007 and $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.



(6) Acquisitions

The results of operations and financial position of the entities acquired during the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from
and after the date of acquisition. There were no significant acquisitions in 2008.

2007 Significant Acquisition

eFunds Corporation

On September 12, 2007, we completed the acquisition of eFunds (the “eFunds Acquisition”). This
acquisition expanded our presence in risk management services, EFT services, prepaid/gift card
processing, and global outsourcing solutions to financial services companies in the U.S. and
internationally. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “eFunds Merger Agreement”) dated
as of June 26, 2007, eFunds became a wholly-owned subsidiary of FIS. The issued and outstanding
shares of eFunds common stock, par value $0.01 per share, were converted into the right to receive
$36.50 per share in cash from us.

The total purchase price was as follows (in millions):

We have completed our evaluation of the various employment agreements, lease agreements,
vendor arrangements, and customer contracts of eFunds. This evaluation has resulted in the
recognition of certain liabilities associated with exiting activities of the acquired company.

In connection with the eFunds Acquisition, we also adopted eFunds’ stock option
plans and registered approximately 2.2 million options and 0.2 million restricted stock units in
replacement of similar outstanding awards held by eFunds employees. The amounts attributable to
vested options are included as an adjustment to the purchase price, and the amounts attributable to
unvested



options and restricted stock units will be expensed over the remaining vesting period based on a
valuation as of the date of closing. On March 31, 2008, as approved by the Compensation Committee
of the Company’s Board of Directors, we accelerated the vesting of all stock awards held by eFunds
employees. As a result we recorded $14.1 million in additional stock compensation expense for the
year ended December 31, 2008.

Pro Forma Results

Selected unaudited pro forma results of operations for years ended December 31, 2007, assuming
the eFunds Acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2007, and using actual general and

pre-tax basis.

2006 Significant Acquisition

Certegy

On September 14, 2005, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement with Certegy
under which the Company and Certegy combined operations to form a single publicly traded company
called Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS). Certegy was a payment processing
company headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida. On January 26, 2006, Certegy’s shareholders
approved the Certegy Merger, which was subsequently consummated on February 1, 2006. The Company
acquired Certegy to expand its share of the payment processing services industry and create
synergies with many of its other product lines.

Under the terms of the Certegy Merger agreement, the Company was merged into a wholly owned
subsidiary of Certegy in a tax-free merger, and all of the Company’s outstanding stock was
converted into Certegy common stock.

Generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. require that one of the two companies in
the transaction be designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. FIS has been designated as
the accounting acquirer because immediately after the Certegy Merger its shareholders held more
than 50% of the common stock of the combined company. As a result, the Certegy Merger has been
accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting. Under this
accounting treatment, the Company is considered the acquiring entity and Certegy is considered the
acquired entity for financial reporting purposes. The financial statements of the combined company
after the Certegy Merger reflect the Company’s financial results on a historical basis and include
the results of operations of Certegy from February 1, 2006.

The purchase price was based on the number of outstanding shares of common stock of Certegy on
February 1, 2006, the date of consummation of the Certegy Merger, valued at $33.38 per share (which
was the average of the trading price of Certegy common stock two days before and two days after the
announcement of the Certegy Merger on September 15, 2005 of $37.13, less the $3.75 per share
special dividend declared to former Certegy shareholders just prior to closing). The purchase price
also included the estimated fair value of Certegy’s stock options and restricted stock units
outstanding at the transaction date.

The total purchase price was as follows (in millions):

acquired. The purchase price allocation is as follows (in millions):

(7) Brazilian Venture

In March, 2006 we entered into an agreement with Banco Bradesco S.A. (“Bradesco”) and ABN AMRO
Real (“ABN”) (collectively, “banks”) to form a venture to provide comprehensive, fully outsourced
card processing services to Brazilian card issuers. In exchange for a 51% controlling interest in
the venture, we contributed our existing Brazilian card processing business contracts and Brazilian
card processing infrastructure and committed to make enhancements to our card processing system to
meet the processing needs of the banks and their affiliates. The banks executed long-term,
exclusive contracts to process their card portfolios with the venture in exchange for an aggregate
49% interest in the venture. The conversion of the banks’ existing card portfolios would follow
completion of the system enhancements required for each respective bank. The venture agreement had
certain provisions allowing it to be dissolved if conversions were unsuccessful. This dissolution
right terminated at the ABN conversion date, which occurred in the second quarter 2008. Due to
the lapse of these rights, we recorded a minority interest liability representing the 49% interest
in the venture owned by the banks, and an offsetting customer contract intangible asset. The amount
assigned to the customer intangible assets was $224.2 million and is based on the 49% of the
estimated enterprise value of the venture plus additional consideration of $84.4 million based on
exchange rates as of December 31, 2008. Of the additional consideration, $25.7 million was paid to
the banks during the fourth quarter and the remaining amount will be paid after the final bank
conversions which are expected to be completed in 2009. The customer intangible asset will be
accounted for in accordance with EITF 01-9,

Accounting for Consideration given by a Vendor to a
Customer (including a Reseller of the Vendors products)

, (“EITF 01-9”) and will be amortized over
the contractual relationship as a reduction of revenues based on
projected card volumes over the term of the
contract.

Through December 31, 2008, we contributed approximately $93.8 million of development costs to
the venture based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2008. Development costs in excess of Real
79.0 million ($33.8 million) are to be contractually shared by the parties: 75% by us and 25% by
the banks. During the fourth quarter, the banks contributed $14.7 million representing their 25%
share.

(8) Investment in Covansys Corporation



In July of 2007 Covansys, an equity method investee of ours, was purchased by an unrelated entity.
We received cash proceeds of approximately $430.2 million and recognized a pretax gain of
approximately $274.5 million related to the sale of our investment in Covansys. Additionally, we
held Covansys warrants in 2007 and 2006 that were accounted for under SFAS 115,

Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,

(“SFAS 115”) as available for sale securities
prior to their exercise. Net of tax, amounts recognized in other comprehensive earnings in 2007
and 2006 related to the Covansys warrants were $7.6 million and
$12.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, we had no
remaining interest in Covansys.

(11) Intangible Assets

Customer
relationships intangible assets are generally obtained as part of acquired businesses and are
amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally 5 to 10 years using accelerated methods.
Trademarks determined to have indefinite lives are not amortized, in accordance with the provisions
of SFAS 142.

$53.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During the year
ended December 31, 2008, in accordance with SFAS 142, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of
$52.0 million to reduce the carrying value of a trademark related to the Company’s retail check
business to its estimated fair value, due to declining check volumes and the sale of our Australian
check business. Approximately $26.0 million of this charge is included in cost of revenues in our
Consolidated Statement of Earnings and was recorded in the Corporate and Other segment and $26.0
million (approximately $17.7 million net of tax) is included in discontinued operations in our
Consolidated Statements of Earnings, as a portion of the charge relates to the Company’s Australian
retail check business disposed of in fiscal year 2008 and accounted for as a discontinued operation
pursuant to SFAS No. 144.

On January 18, 2007, we entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as
Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, and Letter of Credit Issuer, Bank of America, N.A., as
Swing Line Lender, and other financial institutions party thereto (the “Credit Agreement”). The
Credit Agreement replaced our prior term loans and revolver as well as a $100 million settlement
facility. As a result of the new credit agreement, we repaid the old credit agreement and recorded
a charge of $27.2 million to write-off unamortized capitalized debt issuance costs. The Credit
Agreement, which became secured as of September 12, 2007, provides for a committed $2.1 billion
five-year term facility denominated in U.S. Dollars (the “Term Loan A”) and a committed $900
million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Loan”) with a sublimit of $250 million for
letters of credit and a sublimit of $250 million for swing line loans, maturing on the fifth
anniversary of the closing date, January 18, 2012 (the “Maturity Date”). The Revolving Loan is
bifurcated into a $735 million multicurrency revolving credit loan (the “Multicurrency Tranche”)
that can be denominated in any combination of U.S. Dollars, Euro, British Pounds Sterling and
Australian Dollars, and any other foreign currency in which the relevant lenders agree to make
advances and a $165 million U.S. Dollar revolving credit loan that can be denominated only in U.S.
Dollars. The swingline loans and letters of credit are available as a sublimit under the
Multicurrency Tranche. In addition, the Credit Agreement originally provided for an uncommitted
incremental loan facility in the maximum principal amount of $600 million, which would be made
available only upon receipt of further commitments from lenders under the Credit Agreement
sufficient to fund the amount requested by us. On July 30, 2007, we, along with the requisite
lenders, executed an amendment to the existing Credit Agreement to facilitate our acquisition of
eFunds. The amendment permitted the issuance of up to $2.1 billion in additional loans, an increase
from the foregoing $600 million. The amendment became effective September 12, 2007. On September
12, 2007, we entered into a joinder agreement to obtain a secured $1.6 billion tranche of term
loans denominated in U.S. Dollars (the “Term Loan B”) under the Credit Agreement, utilizing $1.6
billion of the $2.1 billion uncommitted incremental loan amount. The Term Loan B proceeds were used
to finance the eFunds Acquisition, and pay related fees and expenses. On July 2, 2008, we completed
the spin-off of LPS as a separate publicly traded company. In conjunction with the LPS spin-off, we
immediately retired the outstanding $1,585.0 million principal balance of the Term Loan B. Debt
issuance costs of $9.1 million are capitalized as of December 31, 2008. The $12.4 million remaining
balance of Term Loan B debt issuance costs were written-off during July 2008, in conjunction with
the LPS spin-off and retirement of the Term Loan B.



As of December 31, 2008, the Term Loan A balance was $1,995.0 million and a total of $499.4
million was outstanding under the Revolving Loan. The obligations under the Credit Agreement have
been jointly and severally, unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries.
Additionally, we and certain subsidiary guarantors pledged certain equity interests in other
entities (including certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries) as collateral security for the
obligations under the credit facility and the guarantee.

We may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts under the Revolving Loan from time to time until
the maturity of the Revolving Loan. We must make quarterly principal payments under the Term Loan A
in scheduled installments of: (a) $26.3 million per quarter from
March 31, 2009 through December 31, 2009; and (b) $52.5
million per quarter from March 31, 2010 through September 30, 2011, with the remaining balance of
approximately $1.5 billion payable on the Maturity Date.

In addition to the scheduled principal payments, the Term Loan is (with certain exceptions)
subject to mandatory prepayment upon issuances of debt, casualty and condemnation events, and sales
of assets, as well as from a percentage of excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement)
between zero and fifty percent commencing with the cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2008.
No mandatory prepayments were owed for the year ended December 31, 2008. Voluntary prepayment of
the Loan is generally permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice and subject to a minimum
dollar requirement. Commitment reductions of the Revolving Loan are also permitted at any time
without fee upon proper notice. The Revolving Loan has no scheduled principal payments, but it will
be due and payable in full on the Maturity Date.

The outstanding balance on the Loans bears interest at a floating rate, which is an applicable
margin plus, at our option, either (a) the Eurocurrency (LIBOR) rate or (b) either (i) the federal
funds rate or (ii) the prime rate. The applicable margin is subject to adjustment based on a
leverage ratio (our total indebtedness to our consolidated EBITDA, as further defined in the Credit
Agreement). Alternatively, we have the ability to request the lenders to submit competitive bids
for one or more advances under the Revolving Loan.

The Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for
financings of this type, including, among other things, limits on the creation of liens, limits on
the incurrence of indebtedness, restrictions on investments and dispositions, a prohibition on the
payment of dividends and other restricted payments if an event of default has occurred and is
continuing or would result therefrom, a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage
ratio. Upon an event of default, the Administrative Agent can accelerate the maturity of the Loans.
Events of default include conditions customary for such an agreement, including failure to pay
principal and interest in a timely manner and breach of certain covenants. These events of default
include a cross-default provision that permits the lenders to declare the Credit Agreement in
default if (i) we fail to make any payment after the applicable grace period under any indebtedness
with a principal amount in excess of $150 million or (ii) we fail to perform any other term under
any such indebtedness, as a result of which the holders thereof may cause it to become due and
payable prior to its maturity. We were in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit
Agreement at December 31, 2008.

Through the merger with Certegy Inc., we acquired an obligation to service $200.0 million
(aggregate principal amount) of secured 4.75% fixed-rate notes, which were repaid and fully
satisfied on September 15, 2008. The notes were recorded in purchase accounting at a discount of
$5.7 million, which was amortized over the term of the notes.

Through the eFunds acquisition on September 12, 2007, we assumed $100.0 million in long-term
notes payable previously issued by eFunds (the “eFunds Notes”). On February 26, 2008, we redeemed
the eFunds Notes for a total of $109.3 million, which included a make-whole premium of $9.3
million.

As of December 31, 2008, we have entered into the following interest rate swap transactions

In addition to the fixed rates paid under the swaps, we pay an
applicable margin to our bank lenders on the Term Loan A of 0.88% and
the Revolving Loan of 0.70% (plus a facility fee of 0.18%) as of
December 31, 2008.



We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges in accordance with
SFAS 133. The estimated fair value of these cash flow hedges results in liabilities of
$84.2 million and $41.2 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of these
liabilities, $75.0 million is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of December
31, 2008 and $9.2 million and $41.2 million is included in other long-term liabilities as of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive earnings, net of deferred taxes. A portion of the amount included
in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as a yield
adjustment as interest payments are made on the Term and Revolving Loans. In accordance with the
provisions of SFAS 157, the inputs used to determine
the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps are Level 2-type measurements. In accordance
with SFAS 157, we considered our own credit risk when determining the fair value of our
interest rate swaps. During June 2008, we terminated the $750 million interest rate swap tied to
the Term Loan B that was retired during July 2008, without any significant impact to our financial
position or results of operations during the period as its fair value was approximately zero on the
date of termination.

Our existing cash flow hedges are highly effective and there is no current impact on earnings
due to hedge ineffectiveness. It is our policy to execute such instruments with credit-worthy banks
at the time of execution and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative
purposes. As of December 31, 2008, we believe that our interest rate swap counterparties will be
able to fulfill their obligations under our agreements and we believe that we will have debt
outstanding through the various expiration dates of the swaps such that the future hedge cash flows
remain probable of occurring.

Management believes that based on its historical pattern of taxable income, projections of
future income, tax planning strategies and other relevant evidence, the Company will produce
sufficient income in the future to realize its deferred income tax assets. A valuation allowance is
established for any portion of a deferred income tax asset if management believes it is more likely
than not that the Company will not be able to realize the benefits or portion of a deferred income
tax asset. Adjustments to the valuation allowance will be made if there is a change in management’s
assessment of the amount of deferred income tax asset that is realizable.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had income taxes (payable) receivable of ($1.1)
million and $32.2 million, respectively.

Pre-tax income as of December 31, 2006, was $5.2 million while the income tax benefit for the
same period was ($2.9) million. The impact of the favorable rate adjustments including the foreign
rate differential results in significant rate adjustments relative to the
Company’s pre-tax income.



At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company has federal, state and foreign net operating loss
carryforwards resulting in deferred tax assets of $60.5 million and $64.6 million, respectively.
The federal net operating losses result in deferred tax assets at December 31, 2008 and 2007 of
$2.1 million and $13.6 million, respectively, which expire between 2019 and 2024. The Company
anticipates fully utilizing these net operating losses prior to expiration. The Company also has
state net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a deferred tax asset of $5.3 million at
December 31, 2008 and 2007. The Company has a full valuation allowance against this amount at
December 31, 2008 and 2007. The Company has foreign net operating loss carryforwards resulting in
deferred tax assets at December 31, 2008 and 2007 of $53.1 million and $45.6 million, respectively.
The Company has valuation allowances against these net operating losses at December 31, 2008 and
2007 of $5.2 million and $5.2 million, respectively. During 2008, the Company recorded a deferred
tax asset of $7.4 million related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards resulting from a
prior acquisition. The offset was recorded as a reduction of goodwill. At December 31, 2008 and
2007, the Company had foreign tax credit carryovers of $13.5 million and $12.4 million,
respectively, which expire between 2013 and 2025. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company has
a valuation allowance against $2.3 million of foreign tax credits that the Company’s management
believes it is more likely than not that it will not realize the benefit.

As of January 1, 2005, the IRS selected the Company to participate in the Compliance Assurance
Process (CAP) which is a real-time audit for 2005 and future years. The IRS has completed its
review for years 2002-2006 which resulted in immaterial adjustments for tax year 2004. Currently
management believes the ultimate resolution of the IRS examinations will not result in a material
adverse effect to the Company’s financial position or results of operations. Substantially all
material foreign income tax return matters have been concluded through 2001. Substantially all
state income tax returns have been concluded through 2004.

The Company provides for United States income taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless
they are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. At December 31, 2008, the
cumulative earnings on which United States taxes have not been
provided for were $201.1 million. If
these earnings were repatriated to the United States, they would generate foreign tax credits that
could reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend.

beginning and end of the period (in millions) as required by FASB Interpretation No. 48,

December 31, 2008. Interest and penalties are recorded as a
component of income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings.

Due to the expiration of various statutes of limitation in the next twelve months, an
estimated $2.1 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized during that twelve
month period.

Driver’s Privacy Protection Act

A putative class action lawsuit styled Richard Fresco, et al. v. Automotive Directions, Inc.
et al., was filed against eFunds and seven other non-related parties in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of Florida. The complaint alleged that eFunds purchased motor vehicle records
that were used for marketing and other purposes that are not permitted under the Federal Driver’s
Privacy Protection Act (“DPPA”). The plaintiffs sought statutory damages, plus costs, attorney’s
fees and injunctive relief. eFunds and five of the other seven defendants settled the case with the
plaintiffs. That settlement was approved by the court over the objection of a group of Texas
drivers and motor vehicle record holders. The plaintiffs have since moved to amend the court’s
order approving the settlement in order to seek a greater attorneys’ fee award and to recover
supplemental costs. In the meantime, the objectors filed two class action complaints styled

Sharon Taylor, et al. v. Biometric Access Company et al

and

Sharon Taylor, et
al. v. Acxiom et al

in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging
similar violations of the DPPA. The Acxiom action was filed against the Company’s ChexSystems, Inc.
subsidiary, while the Biometric suit was filed against the Company’s Certegy Check Services, Inc.
subsidiary. The judge recused himself in the action against Certegy because he was a potential
member of the class. The lawsuit was then assigned to a new judge and Certegy filed a motion to
dismiss. The court granted Certegy’s motion to dismiss with prejudice in the third quarter of 2008.
ChexSystems filed a motion to dismiss or stay its action based upon the earlier settlement and the
Court granted the motion to stay pending resolution of the Florida case. The court dismissed the
ChexSystems’ lawsuit with prejudice against the remaining defendants in the third quarter of 2008.
The plaintiffs moved the court to amend the dismissal to exclude defendants that were parties to
the Florida settlement. That motion was granted. The plaintiffs then appealed the dismissal. The
plaintiffs’ appeals of the dismissals in both lawsuits are pending.

Searcy, Gladys v. eFunds Corporation

This is a nationwide putative class action that was originally filed against eFunds
Corporation and its affiliate Deposit Payment Protection Services, Inc. during the first quarter of
2008. The complaint alleges willful violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) in
connection with the operation of the Shared Check Authorization Network (“SCAN”). Plaintiff’s
principal allegation is that consumers did not receive appropriate disclosures pursuant to §1681g
of the FCRA because the disclosures did not include: (i) all information in the consumer’s file at
the time of the request; (ii) the source of the information in the consumer’s file; and/or (iii)
the names of any persons who requested information related to the consumer’s check writing history
during the prior year. The Company is vigorously defending the matter.

Indemnifications and Warranties

The Company often indemnifies its customers against damages and costs resulting from claims of
patent, copyright, or trademark infringement associated with use of its software through software
licensing agreements. Historically, the Company has not made any payments under such
indemnifications, but continues to monitor the conditions that are subject to the indemnifications
to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred, and would recognize any such losses
when they are estimable. In addition, the Company warrants to customers that its software operates
substantially in accordance with the software specifications. Historically, no costs have been
incurred related to software warranties and none are expected in the future, and as such no
accruals for warranty costs have been made.

Leases

The Company leases certain of its property under leases which expire at various dates. Several
of these agreements include escalation clauses and provide for purchases and renewal options for
periods ranging from one to five years.

Future minimum operating lease payments for leases with remaining terms greater than one year
for each of the years in the five years ending December 31, 2013, and thereafter in the aggregate,
are as follows (in millions):

In addition, the Company has operating lease commitments relating to office equipment and
computer hardware with annual lease payments of approximately $21.6 million per year which renew on
a short-term basis.



Rent expense incurred under all operating leases during the years ended December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006 was $117.0 million, $108.4 million and $81.5 million, respectively. Included in
discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings was rent expense of $14.2
million, $23.5 million and $45.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Data Processing and Maintenance Services Agreements.

The Company has agreements with various
vendors, which expire between 2009 and 2017, for portions of its computer data processing
operations and related functions. The Company’s estimated aggregate contractual obligation
remaining under these agreements was approximately $584.0 million as of December 31, 2008. However,
this amount could be more or less depending on various factors such
as the inflation rate, foreign exchange rates, the
introduction of significant new technologies, or changes in the Company’s data processing needs.

(18) Employee Benefit Plans

Stock Purchase Plan

Prior to the Certegy Merger (Note 6), FIS employees participated in the Fidelity National
Financial, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). Subsequent to the Certegy Merger, the Company
instituted its own plan with the same terms as the Fidelity National Financial, Inc. plan. Under
the terms of both plans and subsequent amendments, eligible employees may voluntarily purchase, at
current market prices, shares of FNF’s (prior to the Certegy Merger) or FIS’ (post Certegy Merger)
common stock through payroll deductions. Pursuant to the ESPP, employees may contribute an amount
between 3% and 15% of their base salary and certain commissions. Shares purchased are allocated to
employees based upon their contributions. The Company contributes varying matching amounts as
specified in the ESPP. The Company recorded an expense of $14.3 million, $15.2 million and
$13.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 relating to the
participation of FIS employees in the ESPP. Included in discontinued operations in the Consolidated
Statements of Earnings was $2.9 million, $5.6 million and $4.6 million for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.


01(k)

Profit Sharing Plan

The Company’s employees are covered by a qualified 401(k) plan. Prior to the Certegy Merger,
this plan was sponsored by FNF. Eligible employees may contribute up to 40% of their pretax annual
compensation, up to the amount allowed pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. The Company generally
matches 50% of each dollar of employee contribution up to 6% of the employee’s total eligible
compensation. The Company recorded expense of $18.5 million, $20.3 million and $19.0 million, respectively,
for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 relating to the participation of FIS employees
in the 401(k) plan. Included in discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings
was expense of $3.8 million, $7.7 million and $6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively.

Stock Option Plans

In 2005, the Company adopted the FIS 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). As of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were 2.7 million and 2.6 million options outstanding under this
plan, respectively, at a strike price of $8.71 per share (as adjusted for the 1.7952 conversion
ratio for the LPS spin-off and the 0.6396 exchange ratio in the
Certegy transaction), respectively. These stock options were granted at the fair value of the
Company’s stock on the grant date based on the price for which the Company sold 32 million shares
(a 25% interest) to the financial sponsors in the recapitalization transaction on March 9, 2005.
The options granted thus far under this plan have a term of 10 years and vest quarterly over either
a 4 or 5 year period (the “time-based options”) on a quarterly basis or based on specific
performance criteria (the “performance-based options”). The performance-based options vested in
2006 after the performance criteria was met subsequent to the Certegy Merger.

Through the Certegy Merger, the Company assumed the Certegy Inc. Stock Incentive Plan that
provides for the issuance of qualified and non-qualified stock options to officers and other key
employees at exercise prices not less than market on the date of grant. All options and awards
outstanding prior to the Certegy Merger under the Certegy Plan were fully vested as of the Certegy
Merger date. As part of the Certegy Merger, the Certegy shareholders approved amendments to the
plan and approved an additional 6.0 million shares to be made available under the plan. The Company
granted 0.1 million, 4.7 million and 4.7 million options under this plan in the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and for the period from February 1,
2006 through December 31, 2006, respectively. There were 14.7 million and 11.4 million options outstanding under this plan at December 31, 2008
and 2007, respectively.

On November 9, 2006, as part of the closing of the FNF Merger, the Company assumed certain
options and restricted stock grants that the Company’s employees and directors held in FNF under
certain FNF stock option plans. The Company assumed 2.7 million options to replace approximately
4.9 million outstanding FNF options per the FNF Merger agreement. The Company also assumed
0.1 million shares of restricted stock.



Certain FIS employees were participants in FNF’s stock-based compensation plans prior to the
FNF Merger, which provide for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted
stock and other stock-based incentive awards for officers and key employees. Grants of incentive
and nonqualified stock options under these plans have generally provided that options shall vest
equally over three years and generally expire ten years after their original date of grant. All
options granted under these plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. There were no FNF options granted to FIS employees
under these plans in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The Company recorded expense
relating to these options and restricted stock of $1.0 million, $6.4 million and $3.8 million in
the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. All FNF options and restricted
stock for which the Company now records expense were converted into FIS options and restricted
stock in the FNF Merger noted above.

On September 12, 2007, as part of the closing of the eFunds acquisition, the Company assumed
certain vested and unvested options and restricted stock units that the employees of eFunds held as
of the acquisition date in the eFunds stock option plans. The Company assumed 2.2 million options
and 0.1 million restricted stock units.

In 2008, the Company adopted the FIS 2008 Stock Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2008 there
were 4.8 million options outstanding under this plan and 19.2 million options available for grant
under this plan.

On July 2, 2008, we completed the LPS spin-off. All stock options and awards held by our
employees that became LPS employees were cancelled as of that date and reissued as LPS stock
options and awards which are being accounted for in LPS’ financial results on a go-forward basis.
All stock options and awards held by employees that continued to be FIS employees were adjusted
using a conversion factor to adjust both the number of awards and the strike price of the awards
that ensured the fair value of the option and award was the same immediately before and after the
spin-off transaction.

employees were adjusted using a conversion factor of 1.7952 to adjust both the number of

The
Company has provided for total stock compensation expense of
$60.7 million, $
39.0 million and $50.1 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, which is included in
selling, general, and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, unless the
expense is attributable to a discontinued operation. The amount of stock compensation expense
related to discontinued operations is $9.1 million, $14.0 million and $24.1 million in 2008, 2007
and 2006, respectively, and has been reclassified accordingly. The year ended December 31, 2008,
included stock compensation expense of $14.1 million relating to the acceleration of option vesting
for all options held by eFunds employees prior to the merger and $2.6 million relating to the
acceleration upon termination of certain executive unvested stock awards. The year ended
December 31, 2007 included stock compensation expense of $2.2 million relating to the acceleration
of option vesting upon termination of certain employees during the year. The year ended 2006
included stock compensation expense of $24.5 million relating to the FIS performance based options
granted on March 9, 2005 for which the performance and market based criteria for vesting were met
during the period and a $6.1 million charge relating to the acceleration of option vesting per the
FNF Merger agreement.

The
weighted average fair value of options granted during 2008, 2007 and
2006 were
estimated to be $3.84, $12.60 and $15.52, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the assumptions below:

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested
stock awards is $69.3 million and $123.4 million, respectively, which is expected to be recognized
in pre-tax income over a weighted average period of 1.6 years and 1.8 years, respectively. The
amount for 2007 includes awards cancelled in the LPS spin.

On October 25, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a plan authorizing repurchases of up to
$200 million worth of our common stock (the “Old Plan”). On April 17, 2008, our Board of Directors
approved a plan authorizing repurchases of up to an additional $250.0 million worth of our common
stock (the “New Plan”). Under the New Plan we repurchased 5.8 million shares of our stock for
$226.2 million, at an average price of $38.97 for the year ended December 31, 2008. During the year
ended December 31, 2008, we also repurchased an additional 0.2 million shares of our stock for
$10.0 million at an average price of $40.56 under the Old Plan. During 2007 and 2006, the Company
repurchased 1.6 million shares and 4.3 million shares, respectively, at an average price of $49.15
and $37.60, respectively under the Old Plan.

On March 20, 2008, we granted 0.4 million shares of restricted stock at a price of $38.75
that vest quarterly over 2 years. On July 2, 2008, $0.2 million of these shares were cancelled and
assumed by LPS. The remaining unvested restricted shares were converted by the conversion factor of
1.7952. On October 27, 2008, we granted 0.8 million shares of restricted stock at a price of $14.35
that vest annually over 3 years. As of December 31, 2008, we have approximately 1.0 million
unvested restricted shares remaining.



Defined Benefit Plans

Certegy Pension Plan

In connection with the Certegy Merger, the Company announced that it was going to terminate
and settle the Certegy U.S. Retirement Income Plan (“USRIP”). The estimated impact of this
settlement was reflected in the purchase price allocation as an increase in the pension liability,
less the fair value of the pension plan assets, based on estimates of the total cost to settle the
liability through the purchase of annuity contracts or lump sum settlements to the beneficiaries.
The final USRIP settlement occurred during the fourth quarter of 2007
and was paid to the
participant electing to take a lump-sum payment of their accrued benefit or receiving an annuity
contract for their remaining benefit. The aggregate settlement value was $73.5 million. In addition
the Company amended the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) to effectively freeze the
benefits entitled under the plan resulting in a curtailment and settlement of that plan at
December 31, 2007. The liabilities of that plan were then paid out in February 2008.

Kordoba

In connection with the Kordoba acquisition, the Company assumed Kordoba’s unfunded, defined
benefit plan obligations. These obligations relate to retirement benefits to be paid to Kordoba’s
employees upon retirement. Total benefit costs for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
were $2.9 million, $3.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation
at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $27.7 million and $28.9 million, respectively, and the projected
benefit obligation was $28.6 million and $30.1 million, respectively. The plan remains unfunded as
of December 31, 2008.

The measurement date for the Plan was December 31, 2008. The assumptions used to determine benefit
obligations at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 and the periodic pension costs for the periods in
each of the years then ended were as follows:

(19) Concentration of Risk

The Company generates a significant amount of revenue from large customers, however, no
customers accounted for more than 10% of total revenue or total segment revenue in the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk
consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables.

The Company places its cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions and,
by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited because a large
number of geographically diverse customers make up the Company’s customer base, thus spreading the
trade receivables credit risk. The Company controls credit risk through monitoring procedures.

(20) Segment Information

On July 2, 2008, we completed the LPS spin-off. The results of operations of the lender
processing services segment are reflected as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements
of Earnings, in accordance with SFAS 144, for all periods presented. Prior to the LPS spin-off
(see note 4), the Company operated in two reportable segments, Transaction Processing Services
(TPS) and Lender Processing Services (LPS).



Subsequent to the LPS spin-off, we completed the previously announced review and restructuring
of our reporting and management structure, and  are now reporting the results
of our operations in four new reporting segments: 1) Financial Solutions, 2) Payment Solutions, 3)
International and 4) Corporate and Other. All periods presented have been conformed to reflect
the segment changes.

Controls and Procedures.

As of the end of the year covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under
the supervision and with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and
procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 (e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this
evaluation, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded
that its disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that its
disclosure controls and procedures will timely alert them to material information required to be
included in the Company’s periodic SEC reports.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting. Management has adopted the framework in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Based on our evaluation under this framework, our management concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008. KPMG LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over
financial reporting as set forth in Item 8.

Item 9B.
