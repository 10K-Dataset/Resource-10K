Item 1. Business.

Business Overview

We store records, primarily paper documents and data backup media, and provide information management services that help organizations
around the world protect their information, lower storage rental costs, comply with regulations, enable corporate disaster recovery, and better use their information for business advantages,
regardless of its format, location or lifecycle stage. We offer comprehensive records and information management services and data management services,
along with the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges such as rising storage rental costs, and increased litigation, regulatory compliance and
disaster recovery requirements. Founded in an underground facility near Hudson, New York in 1951, Iron Mountain Incorporated, a Delaware corporation, is a trusted partner to more than 155,000
customers throughout North America, Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. We have a diversified customer base consisting of commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance,
entertainment and government organizations, including more than 92% of the Fortune 1000. As of December 31, 2014, we operated in 36 countries on five continents and employed over 20,000 people.

Now
in our 64th year, we have experienced tremendous growth, particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in February 1996. We have
grown from a U.S. business operating fewer than 85 facilities (6 million square feet) with limited storage and information management service offerings and annual revenues of
$104.0 million in 1995 into a global enterprise providing storage and a broad range of related records and information management services to customers in markets around the world with
approximately 1,100 facilities (67.8 million square feet) as of December 31, 2014 and total revenues of more than $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. On
January 5, 2009, we were added to the S&P 500 Index. On November 28 2014, we were added to the MSCI REIT index and as of December 31, 2014 we were number 712 on the
Fortune 1000.

REIT Conversion

We are committed to delivering stockholder value. To that end, and supported by our strong cash flows, we initiated a stockholder
payout program in February 2010 and a dividend policy under which we have paid, and in the future intend to pay, cash dividends on our common stock. In April 2011, we announced a three-year strategic
plan to increase stockholder value. A major component of that plan was our commitment to significant stockholder payouts of $2.2 billion through 2013, with $1.2 billion being paid out by
May 2012. We fulfilled the commitment to return $1.2 billion of cash to stockholders by May 2012, and in June 2012, we announced our intention to pursue conversion to a REIT. The plan was
unanimously approved by our board of directors following a thorough analysis and careful consideration of ways to maximize value through alternative financing, capital and tax strategies. Since May
2012, we have returned $2.1 billion of capital to stockholders including $1.0 billion in cash and $1.1 billion in our common stock.

As
part of our plan to convert to a REIT for federal income tax purposes and elect REIT status effective January 1, 2014, we sought private letter rulings ("PLRs") from the United
States Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") relating to numerous technical tax issues, including classification of our steel racking structures as qualified real estate assets. We submitted the PLR
requests in the third quarter of 2012, and on June 25, 2014, we announced that we received the favorable PLRs from the IRS necessary for our conversion to a REIT. After receipt of the PLRs, our
board of directors unanimously approved our conversion to a REIT for our taxable year beginning January 1, 2014.

In
connection with our conversion to a REIT and, in particular, to impose ownership limitations customary for REITs, on January 20, 2015, we completed the merger with our
predecessor and all outstanding shares of our predecessor's common stock were converted into a right to receive an equal



number
of shares of our common stock. Accordingly, references herein to our "common stock" refer to our common stock and the common stock of our predecessor, as applicable.

The Durability of Our Business

We believe that the creation of paper-based information will be sustained, not in spite of, but because of, "paperless" technologies
such as e-mail and the Internet. These technologies have prompted the creation of hard copies of such electronic information and have also led to increased demand for electronic records services, such
as the storage and off-site rotation of backup copies of magnetic media. In addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital information technologies and distributed data networks has created a
growing need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality technology solutions for electronic data protection and the management of electronic documents.

We
believe that the volume of stored physical and electronic records will continue to increase on a global basis for a number of reasons, including: (1) regulatory requirements;
(2) concerns over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of records; (3) the continued proliferation of data processing technologies such as
personal computers and networks; (4) inexpensive document producing technologies such as desktop publishing software and desktop printing; (5) the high cost of reviewing records and
deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and (7) the need to keep backup copies of certain records
in off-site locations for business continuity purposes in the event of disaster.

Business Strategy

Overview

We have transitioned from a growth strategy driven primarily by acquisitions of storage and information management services companies
to a strategy that targets multiple sources of revenue growth. Our current strategy is focused on: (1) increasing revenues in developed markets such as the United States, Canada, Australia and
western Europe, primarily through improved sales and marketing efforts and attractive fold-in acquisitions; (2) establishing and enhancing leadership positions in high-growth emerging markets
such as central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region (excluding Australia), primarily through acquisitions; and (3) continuing to identify, incubate and scale emerging
business opportunities to support our long-term growth objectives and drive solid returns on invested capital. In our developed markets, we expect continuous improvement initiatives will generate
modest profit growth, a portion of which we expect to reinvest in our business. In our existing emerging markets, we expect profits will grow as the local businesses scale, and we will look to
reinvest a portion of that improvement to support the growth of these businesses. However, any increases in our international profits will be limited as we seek to make acquisitions in new emerging
markets.

Storage
rental is the key driver of our economics and allows us to expand our relationships with our customers through value-added services that flow from storage rental. Consistent with
our overall strategy, we are focused on increasing incoming volumes on a global basis. There are multiple sources of new volumes available to us, and these sources inform our growth investment
strategy. Our investments in sales and marketing support sales to new customers that do not currently outsource some or all of their storage and information management needs, as well as increased
volumes from existing customers. We also expect to invest in acquisitions of customer relationships and storage and information management services businesses. In our developed markets, we expect that
these acquisitions will primarily be fold-in acquisitions designed to optimize the utilization of existing assets, expand our presence and better serve customers. We also expect to use acquisitions to
expand our presence in attractive, higher growth emerging markets. Finally, we continue to pursue new rental streams through emerging business opportunities.



We
offer our customers an integrated value proposition by providing them with secure storage and comprehensive service offerings, including records and information management services
and data management services. We have the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges, such as rising storage rental costs and increased litigation,
regulatory compliance and disaster recovery requirements. We expect to maintain a leadership position in the storage and information management services industry around the world by enabling customers
to store, protect and better use their information—regardless of its format, location or lifecycle stage—so they can optimize their business and ensure proper recovery,
compliance and discovery. Our objective is to continue to capitalize on our brand, our expertise in the storage and information management industry and our global network to enhance our customers'
experience, thereby increasing our customer retention rates and attracting new customers. Our overall growth strategy will focus on growing our business organically, making strategic customer
acquisitions, pursuing acquisitions of storage and information management businesses, and developing ancillary businesses and real estate. We continue to expand our portfolio of products and services.
Adding new products and services allows us to strengthen our existing customer relationships and attract new customers in previously untapped markets.

Growth from Existing and New Customers

Our existing customers' storage of physical records contributes to the growth of storage rental and certain records and information
management services revenues because, on average, our existing customers generate additional records at a faster rate than old records are destroyed or permanently removed. The growth in new records
volume from our existing customers has been consistent in the past three years, and we anticipate this growth will be sustained, although we cannot give any assurance as to whether this growth will
continue. In order to maximize growth opportunities from existing customers, we seek to maintain high levels of customer retention by providing premium customer service.

Our
sales coverage model is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by strategically allocating our sales resources to our customer base and selling
additional storage, records and information management services and products in new and existing markets. Our sales force is dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer
account relationships; (2) generating additional revenue by expanding existing customer relationships globally; and (3) expanding new and existing customer relationships by effectively
selling a wide array of related services and products. In order to accomplish these objectives, our sales forces draw on our United States and international marketing organizations and senior
management. We are developing tailored marketing strategies to target customers in the healthcare, financial, insurance, legal, life sciences, energy, business services and federal vertical market
segments.

Growth through Acquisitions

The storage and information management services industry is highly fragmented with thousands of competitors in North America and around
the world. Between 1995 and 2004 there was significant acquisition activity in the industry. Acquisitions were a fast and efficient way to achieve scale, expand geographically and broaden service
offerings. After 2004, acquisition activity was reduced as we focused on integrating these recent transactions and diversifying the business.
Beginning again in 2012, we saw opportunities for attractive acquisitions in emerging markets and consolidation opportunities in more developed markets, and resumed acquisition activity. We believe
this ongoing acquisition activity is due to opportunities for large providers to achieve economies of scale and meet customer demands for sophisticated, technology-based solutions. Attractive
acquisition opportunities, in North America and internationally, many of which are small, continue to exist, and we expect to continue to pursue acquisition of these businesses where we believe they
present a good opportunity to create value for our stockholders. Lastly, we have a successful record of acquiring and integrating these businesses.



We
have acquired, and we continue to seek to acquire, storage and information management services businesses in developed markets including the United States, Canada, Australia and
western Europe. Given the relatively small size of most attractive acquisition targets in these markets, future acquisitions are expected to be less significant to our overall revenue growth in these
markets than in the past. Occasionally, however, we may be presented with the opportunity to acquire one of the larger businesses in these markets and will evaluate each opportunity with a focus on
return on invested capital and the creation of stockholder value. Such was the case with our acquisition in October 2013 of Cornerstone Records Management, LLC and its affiliates.

We
expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments in storage and information management services businesses in targeted emerging markets outside the United States, Canada,
Australia and western Europe. We have acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire and invest in, storage and information management services companies in certain countries, and, more specifically,
certain markets within such countries, where we believe there is potential for significant growth. We expect that future acquisitions and investments will focus primarily on expanding priority markets
in central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region.

The
experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important in our emerging market acquisition strategy. Since beginning our international expansion program in
January 1999, we have, directly and through joint ventures, expanded our operations into 35 countries. These transactions have taken, and may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of an entire
business or controlling or minority investments with a long-term goal of full ownership. We believe a joint venture strategy, rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets, better
position us to expand the existing business. The local partners benefit from our expertise in the storage and information management services industry, our multinational customer relationships, our
access to capital and our technology, while we benefit from our local partners' knowledge of the market, relationships with local customers and their presence in the community. In addition to the
criteria we use to evaluate developed market acquisition candidates, when looking at an emerging market acquisition we also evaluate risks uniquely associated with an international investment,
including those risks described below. Our long-term goal is to acquire full ownership of each business in which we make a joint venture investment. We now own more than 98% of our international
operations, measured as a percentage of consolidated revenues.

Our
international investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as
fluctuations in currency valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors.

Business Characteristics.

We generate our revenues by renting storage space to a large and diverse customer base in approximately 1,100 facilities representing
67.8 million square feet of real estate as of December 31, 2014 around the globe and providing to our customers an expanding menu of related and ancillary products and services.
Providing outsourced storage is the mainstay of our customer relationships and serves as the foundation for all our revenue growth. Services are a vital part of a comprehensive records management
program and consist primarily of the handling and transportation of stored records and information, shredding, document management solutions ("DMS"), data restoration projects, fulfillment services,
consulting services, technology services, product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies), and recurring project revenues. Shredding consists primarily of the
scheduled collection and shredding of records and documents generated by business operations and the sale of recycled paper resulting from shredding services.



Secure Storage

Our storage operations consist of providing non-dedicated storage rental space to our customers. Non-dedicated space allows our
customers to increase or decrease the volume of their physical storage over the life of the contract based on their storage needs, while also reducing their risk of loss in the event of natural
disaster. Given this non-dedicated space dynamic, the large portfolio of customer contracts, and the fact that no customer accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated revenues as of the year ended
December 31, 2014, we assess the performance of our storage rental business predominantly by analyzing trends in segment level storage rental volume and storage rental revenue.

Renting
secure space to customers for the purpose of storing paper records and data backup media is our largest source of revenue. Records storage consists primarily of the archival
storage of records for long periods of time according to applicable laws, regulations and industry best practices. The secure off-site storage of data backup media is a key component of a company's
disaster recovery and business continuity programs, and storage rental charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis.

Hard
copy business records are typically stored for long periods of time with limited activity in cartons packed by the customer. For some customers we store individual files on an open
shelf basis, and these files are typically more active. Storage rental charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis, usually per cubic foot of records, and include the provision of
space, racking systems, computerized inventory and activity tracking, and physical security.

Physical
records may also include critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film and other highly proprietary information, such as energy data. We
continue to identify additional areas of physical storage that fit with our core competencies in security and transportation, seeking to provide enterprise storage to businesses in much the same
manner that self-storage companies serve consumers. Physical records may require special facilities, either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. Accordingly, our
charges for providing enhanced security and special climate-controlled environments for these vital records are higher than for typical storage rental.

Physical Records

Physical records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. Active records relate to ongoing and recently
completed activities or contain information that is frequently referenced. Active records are usually stored and managed on-site by their owners to ensure ready availability. Inactive physical records
are the principal focus of the storage and information management services industry and consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be retained for legal,
regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations.

Physical
data management services consist of the rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery and business continuity plans. Computer tapes, cartridges and
disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where they are available to customers 24 hours a day,
365 days a year, to facilitate data recovery in the event of a disaster. Frequently, backup tapes are rotated from our facilities back to our customers' data centers. We also manage tape
library relocations and support disaster recovery testing and execution.

Electronic Records

Electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of
recently processed data or archival in nature. We believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they



face
in their physical records management programs and consist primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access to and control over the data in a secure
environment; and (3) the need to retain electronic records due to regulatory requirements or for litigation support. Customer needs for data backup and recovery and archiving are distinctively
different. Backup data exists because of the need of many businesses to be able to recover the data in the event of a system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. It is customary (and a best
practice) for data processing groups to rotate backup tapes to offsite locations on a regular basis and to store multiple copies of such information at multiple sites. In addition to the physical
storage and rotation of backup data that we provide, we offer online backup services through partnerships as an alternative way for businesses to store and access data. Online backup is an
Internet-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop and laptop computers over the Internet and stores it in secure data centers.

Service Offerings

Central to any records management program is the handling and transportation and the eventual destruction of records upon the
expiration of retention periods. These activities are accomplished through our extensive service and courier operations. Service charges are generally assessed for each activity on a per unit basis.
Courier operations consist primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request. Charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location and are billed
monthly. As of December 31, 2014, our courier fleet consisted of approximately 3,600 owned or leased vehicles. Our other services include secure shredding, DMS, Compliant Records Management and
Consulting Services, Health Information Storage and Management Solutions, Entertainment Services, Energy Data Services, Discovery Services and other ancillary services.

Our
information destruction services consist primarily of physical secure shredding operations and typically include the scheduled pick-up of loose office records that customers
accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide. In addition, secure shredding is a natural extension of our hard copy records management services by completing the lifecycle of a record
and involves the shredding of sensitive documents for customers that, in many cases, store their records with us. Complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste paper to
third-party recyclers. Through a combination of plant-based shredding operations and mobile shredding units consisting of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our
customers throughout the United States, Canada and Latin America. In December 2014, we sold our secure shredding businesses in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia, which were much smaller than
our operation in North America, because we did not benefit from scale in these markets.

The
focus of our DMS business is to develop, implement and support comprehensive storage and information management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers' information. We
seek to develop solutions that solve our customers' document management challenges by integrating the management of physical records, document conversion and digital storage. Our DMS services
complement our service offerings and enhance our existing customer relationships. We differentiate our offerings from our competitors by providing solutions that complement and expand our existing
portfolio of products and services. The trend towards increased usage of Electronic Document Management ("EDM") systems represents another opportunity for us to manage active records. Our DMS services
provide the bridge between customers' physical documents and their EDM solutions.

We
offer records and information management services that have been tailored for specific industries, such as healthcare, or to address the needs of customers with more specific
requirements based on the critical nature of their records. For example, medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide
easier access to individual files. In addition to storing medical records, we provide health care information services, which include the handling, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records
used by hospitals, private practitioners and other medical institutions, as well as recurring project work and ancillary services.



Recurring project work involves the on-site removal of aged patient files and related computerized file indexing. Ancillary healthcare information services
include release of information (medical record copying and delivery), temporary staffing, contract coding, facilities management and imaging. We offer a variety of additional services which customers
may request or contract for on an individual basis. These services include conducting records inventories, packing records into cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files
and individual documents. We also provide services for the management of active records programs. We can provide these services, which generally include document and file processing and storage, both
offsite at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel to perform management functions on-site at a customer's premises. Other services that we provide include fulfillment, professional
consulting services, and technology escrow services.

Business Opportunities ("EBOs") are prospective business lines that we consider investing in to grow and diversify our business. We are seeking businesses with long-term,
recurring revenue, preferably with storage rental attributes, which are consistent with and will enhance our REIT structure. Our management team is focused on identifying and evaluating these
opportunities. We have established an innovation process so we cautiously and effectively develop opportunities to leverage our capabilities. After we have demonstrated success and met return
thresholds, we may potentially acquire businesses to further accelerate our growth in the relevant opportunity. Importantly, the EBO process includes financial hurdles and decision gates to help us
evaluate whether we scale or scrap these opportunities, consistent with our disciplined approach to capital allocation.

Currently,
our data center business is one example of an EBO where we are assessing the potential for additional investment. The growth rate of critical digital information is
accelerating, driven in part by the use of the Internet as a distribution and transaction medium. The rising cost and increasing importance of storing and managing digital information, coupled with
the increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may create meaningful opportunities for us to provide solutions to our customers with respect to their digital records
storage and management challenges.

Our Business Fundamentals

Our business fundamentals are based on the recurring nature of our various revenue streams. We generate attractive returns from our
differentiated storage rental business model because our occupancy costs, whether in a leased or owned building, are incurred per square foot while our storage revenue is generally earned per cubic
foot. The historical predictability of our revenues and the resulting profitability allows us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. Our business fundamentals consist
of:

•

Recurring Revenues.

We derive a majority of our
consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, storage rental fees charged to customers based on the volume of their records stored. Once a customer places physical records in storage
with us, and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed (for which we typically receive a service fee), we receive recurring payments for storage rental without incurring additional
labor or marketing expenses or significant capital costs. Similarly, contracts for the storage of electronic backup media involve primarily fixed monthly rental payments. Our annual revenues from
these fixed periodic storage rental fees have grown for 26 consecutive years. This stable and growing storage rental revenue base also provides the foundation for increases in service revenues and
profitability.

A
customer is allocated a certain amount of storage space in our storage facilities but is not allocated a dedicated building or space in a particular building. In practice, we can, and sometimes
will, for a variety of reasons, move records from one facility and into another facility. In order to track net move-in and move-out activity of customer materials, as well as to assess the
optimization of our real estate portfolio, we regularly assess the utilization of our overall real estate portfolio. On a per building basis, we compare the amount of racking that is being used to
store customer materials to the capacity of the entire building assuming it was fully



racked
("Total Building Utilization"). Additionally, we compare the amount of racking that is being used to store customer materials to the capacity of the racking that has been installed ("Total
Racking Utilization"). As of December 31, 2014, our Total Building Utilization and Total Racking Utilization
were approximately 83% and 91%, respectively, for our records management business and our Total Building Utilization and Total Racking Utilization were approximately 68% and 81%, respectively, for our
data management business.

We
regularly offer concessions to our customers in order to generate new business opportunities. Such concessions most commonly come in the form of providing free intake costs to transport a
customer's records to one of our facilities, including labor and transportation costs ("Move Costs"), or payments that are made to a customer's current records management vendor in order to terminate
the customer's existing contract with that vendor ("Permanent Withdrawal Fees"). We capitalize Move Costs and Permanent Withdrawal Fees as customer acquisition costs.

•

Historically Non-Cyclical Storage Rental
Business.

Historically, we have not experienced significant reductions in our storage rental business as a result of economic downturns.
We believe the durability of our storage rental business is driven by a number of factors, including the trend toward increased records retention, albeit at a lower rate of growth, customer
satisfaction with our services and contractual net price increases. The growth in new records volume from our existing customers has been consistent in the past three years, and we anticipate this
growth will be sustained, although we cannot give any assurance as to whether this growth will continue. Total net volume growth, including acquisitions, was approximately 3%, 6% and 4% on a global
basis for 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.

•

Diversified and Stable Customer Base.

As of
December 31, 2014, we had over 155,000 customers in a variety of industries in 36 countries around the world. We currently provide storage and information management services to legal,
financial, healthcare, insurance, life sciences, energy, businesses services and government organizations, including more than 92% of the Fortune 1000. No single customer accounted for as much as 2%
of our consolidated revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014. For each of the three years 2012 through 2014, the average annual volume reduction due to customers
terminating their relationship with us was approximately 2% to 3%.

•

Capital Allocation.

All the characteristics of our
business noted above support the durability of our cash flows, which in turn support our dividends and a portion of our investments. Absent a large acquisition or significant investments in real
estate, we generally generate cash flows to support our dividends, maintain our operations and infrastructure and invest in core growth opportunities. We plan on funding acquisitions, EBO investments
and real estate investments primarily through incremental borrowing at a targeted leverage ratio and/or proceeds from the issuance of equity. Below are descriptions of the major types of investments
and other capital expenditures that we have made in recent years or that we are likely to consider in 2015:

Real
Estate:

•

Capital expenditures for investments in real estate assets that support core business
growth

—these expenditures are primarily related to investments in land, buildings, building improvements, leasehold improvements and racking structures that expand
our revenue capacity in existing or new geographies, replace a long-term operational obligation or create operational efficiencies.

•

Capital expenditures in real estate assets necessary to maintain ongoing business
operations

—these expenditures are primarily related to the repair or replacement of real estate assets such as buildings, building improvements, leasehold
improvements and racking structures.



Non-Real
Estate:

•

Capital expenditures for investments in non-real estate assets that support core business
growth

—these expenditures support either (i) the growth of our business and/or an increase of our profitability by investing in either supporting assets such
as carton storage systems, tape storage systems and containers, shredding plants and bins, and technology service storage and processing capacity, or (ii) they are directly related to the
development of new products or services in support of our integrated value proposition and enhancements that support our leadership position in the industry, including items such as increased feature
functionality, security upgrades or system enhancements.

•

Capital expenditures in non-real estate assets necessary to maintain ongoing business
operations

—these expenditures are primarily related to the repair or replacement of customer-facing assets such as containers and shred bins, warehouse equipment,
fixtures, computer hardware, or third-party or internally-developed software assets. This category also includes operational support initiatives such as sales and marketing and information technology
projects to support infrastructure requirements.

Represents
capital expenditures on an accrual basis and may differ from amounts presented on the cash basis in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
included in this Annual Report.

Competition

We are a global leader in the physical storage and information management services industry with operations in 36 countries. We compete
with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities. We can provide no assurance that these organizations will begin or continue to use us for
their future storage and information management services.

We
also compete with numerous storage and information management services providers in every geographic area where we operate. The physical storage and information management services
industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of competitors in North America and around the world. We believe that competition for customers is based on price, reputation for reliability,
quality and security of storage, quality of service and scope and scale of technology, and we believe we generally compete effectively in each of these areas.



Alternative Technologies

We derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of paper documents and computer backup tapes and from storage related
services. Alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents and tapes, and as alternative technologies are adopted, storage related services
may decline as the physical records or tapes we store become less active and more archived. To date, none of the alternative technologies has replaced paper documents as the primary means for storing
information. However, we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most or a portion of their records as paper documents or in tape format. We continue to provide, primarily
through partnerships, additional services such as online backup, designed to address our customers' need for efficient, cost-effective, high-quality solutions for electronic records and storage and
information management.

Employees

As of December 31, 2014, we employed more than 7,500 employees in the United States and more than 12,500 employees outside of
the United States. At December 31, 2014, an aggregate of 528 employees were represented by unions in California, Georgia and three provinces in Canada.

All
union and non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability, retirement/401(k)
and accidental death and dismemberment plans. Certain unionized employees in California receive these types of benefits through their unions and are not eligible to participate in our benefit
programs. In addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, all full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues,
profits, collections or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in which they work. Management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and unions. All union employees are
currently under renewed labor agreements or operating under an extension agreement.

Insurance

For strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and
that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. Property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage),
subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. Property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income
loss and extra expense. Other types of insurance that we carry, which are also subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles, include medical, workers' compensation, general
liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse legal liability and directors' and officers' liability policies.

Our
customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability for damages with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records or information stored with us. Our
liability under physical storage contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. Our liability under our DMS services and other service
contracts is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract. We can provide no assurance that where we have limitation of liability provisions that they will be enforceable in all
instances or would otherwise protect us from liability. Also, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain
higher limits. In addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage rental and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms,
including storage rental and service pricing and service
delivery terms. Our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. While we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their



customer
contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, we can give no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future.

Environmental Matters

Some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other
purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. In
some instances this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. Where we are aware of environmental conditions that require
remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. Although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at
some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. We therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs and may be
unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be liable for environmental compliance and
remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the
contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. Environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the
future. In addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today.

We
transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers
all owned and leased locations. Coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs.

Corporate Responsibility

We are committed to transparent reporting on sustainability and corporate responsibility efforts in accordance with the guidelines of
the Global Reporting Initiative. Our corporate responsibility report highlights our progress against key measures of success for our efforts in the community, our environment, and for our people. We
are a trusted partner to more than 92% of the Fortune 1000 companies. Iron Mountain is also a member of the Fortune 1000, ranked at 712 as of December 31, 2014, as well as a member of the FTSE4 Good
Index, MSCI World ESG Index, MSCI ACWI ESG Index and MSCI USA IMI ESG Index in which include companies that meet globally recognized corporate responsibility standards. A copy of our corporate
responsibility report is available on the "Company" section of our website,

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

We face many risks. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occur, we and our businesses, financial condition or
results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. Our current and potential investors should consider the following risks and the information
contained under the heading "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" before deciding to invest in our securities.

Risks Related to Operating as a REIT

If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will be subject to tax at
corporate income tax rates and will not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders when computing our taxable income.

We
began operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2014; however, we can provide no
assurance that we will remain qualified as a REIT. If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply.

REIT
qualification involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), which provisions may change from
time to time, to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. There are limited judicial or administrative
interpretations of these provisions.

If,
in any taxable year, we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under the Code:

•

we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;

•

we will be subject to federal and state income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular
corporate tax rates; and

•

we will be disqualified from REIT tax treatment for four taxable years following the year we were so disqualified.

Any
such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes.

If
we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds
available for investment and distributions to stockholders could be reduced.

As a REIT, failure to make required distributions would subject us to
federal corporate income tax.

We
expect to continue paying regular quarterly distributions, and, to achieve maximum tax efficiency and retain cash to allow us to make selective
discretionary investments, we currently anticipate our typical regular quarterly distributions will be based on a payment of approximately 100% of our REIT taxable income; however, the amount, timing
and form of our regular quarterly distributions will be determined, and will be subject to adjustment, by our board of directors. To remain qualified and be taxed as a REIT, we are generally required
to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year to our stockholders. Generally, we expect to
distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income. If our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates, we may be unable to maintain distributions that approximate our
REIT taxable income and may fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. In addition, our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to



fund
required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible
expenditures, such as capital expenditures, payments of compensation for which Section 162(m) of the Code denies a deduction, the creation of reserves or required debt service or amortization
payments.

To
the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our
undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than the minimum
amount specified under the Code.

We may be required to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity to satisfy
REIT distribution requirements, to comply with asset ownership tests or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives.

In order to meet the REIT distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a REIT, or to fund capital
expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, we may need to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings,
sales or offerings. Any insufficiency of our cash flows to cover our REIT distribution requirements could adversely impact our ability to raise short- and long-term debt, to sell assets, or to offer
equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain our qualification and taxation as a REIT. Furthermore, the REIT distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to
fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. This would increase our indebtedness. An increase in our outstanding debt could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating. A
downgrade of our credit rating could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets. Further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries
may incur. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. For a discussion of risks related to our substantial level of
indebtedness, see "Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness."

Whether
we issue equity, at what price and the amount and other terms of any such issuances will depend on many factors, including alternative sources of capital, our then-existing
leverage, our need for additional capital, market conditions and other factors beyond our control. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt convertible into
equity securities, the percentage of stock ownership by our existing stockholders may be reduced. In addition, new equity securities or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences and
privileges senior to those of our current stockholders, which could substantially decrease the value of our securities owned by them. Depending on the share price we are able to obtain, we may have to
sell a significant number of shares in order to raise the capital we deem necessary to execute our long-term strategy, and our stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares as a
result.

In
addition, if we fail to comply with specified asset ownership tests applicable to REITs as measured at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct such failure within
30 days after the end of the applicable calendar quarter or qualify for statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification. As a result, we may be required to liquidate
otherwise attractive investments. These actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.

Legislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on
us or our stockholders.

At any time, the federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. Federal
and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS, the United States Department of
the Treasury and state taxing authorities. Changes to the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect us. In addition, some
of these changes could have a more



significant
impact on us as compared to other REITs due to the nature of our business and our substantial use of taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"). We cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in
what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations applicable to us may be changed.

Complying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to
forgo otherwise attractive opportunities.

To remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the
sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. Thus, compliance with these tests may require us to refrain from certain
activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-REIT qualifying operations or assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, and
investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. Furthermore, acquisition opportunities in
domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some REIT requirements prior to closing.

We
conduct a significant portion of our business activities, including our information management services businesses and several of our international operations, through domestic and
foreign TRSs. Under the Code, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and other nonqualifying assets. This limitation may affect our
ability to make additional investments in non-REIT qualifying operations or assets or in international operations through TRSs.

As a REIT, we are limited in our ability to fund distribution payments using
cash generated through our TRSs.

Our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a REIT.
In particular, at least 75% of our gross
income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from real estate, which principally includes gross income from providing customers with secure storage space. Consequently, no more than 25% of
our gross income may consist of dividend income from our TRSs and other nonqualifying types of income. Thus, our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs may be limited, and may impact our
ability to fund distributions to our stockholders using cash flows from our TRSs. Specifically, if our TRSs become highly profitable, we might become limited in our ability to receive net income from
our TRSs in an amount required to fund distributions to our stockholders commensurate with that profitability.

In
addition, a significant amount of our income and cash flows from our TRSs is generated from our international operations. In many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency
controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the United States to help satisfy REIT distribution requirements.

Our extensive use of TRSs, including for certain of our international
operations, may cause us to fail to remain qualified as a REIT.

The net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally is not subject
to the REIT income distribution requirement. However, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our TRSs and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our
TRSs could result in adverse tax treatment. In particular, if the accumulation of cash in our TRSs causes the fair market value of our securities in our TRSs and other nonqualifying assets to exceed
25% of the fair market value of our assets, we will fail to remain qualified as a REIT.



Our cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.

A REIT generally is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders.

Our
board of directors, in its sole discretion, will determine on a quarterly basis the amount of cash to be distributed to our stockholders based on a number of factors including, but
not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that
may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, any stock repurchase program and general market demand for our space and services. Consequently, our distribution levels
may fluctuate.

Even if we remain qualified as a REIT, some of our business activities are
subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which will reduce our cash flows, and we will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities.

Even if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and
assets, including alternative minimum taxes, taxes on any undistributed income, and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. In addition, we could in certain
circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain qualification for taxation
as a REIT.

Our
information management services businesses are conducted through wholly owned TRSs because these activities could generate nonqualifying REIT income as currently structured and
operated. The income of our domestic TRSs will continue to be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes. In addition, our international assets and operations will continue to be subject to
taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. Any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash.

We
will also be subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate (currently 35%) on gain recognized from a sale of assets occurring within a specified
period (generally ten years) after the effective date of our REIT election, that is, January 1, 2014, to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of those assets on the
effective date of the REIT election in excess of our then tax basis. In addition, depreciation recapture income that we recognized in our 2014 taxable year and will recognize in subsequent taxable
years, as a result of accounting method changes that were effective prior to January 1, 2014, has been and will be fully subject to this 35% tax.

In
addition, the IRS and any state or local tax authority may successfully assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for our pre-REIT period, in which case we will owe
these taxes plus applicable interest and penalties, if any. Moreover, any increase in taxable income for these pre-REIT periods will likely result in an increase in pre-REIT accumulated earnings and
profits, which could cause us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our stockholders after the relevant determination.

Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively
and increase the cost of our hedging and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.

The REIT provisions of the Code limit our ability to hedge liabilities. Generally, income from hedging transactions that we enter into
to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets and income from certain currency hedging transactions related to our
non-U.S. operations do not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those
transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous



hedging
techniques or implement those hedges through our TRSs. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs would be subject to tax on income or gains resulting from hedges
entered into by them or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates or exchange rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, hedging losses in any of our TRSs
generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward for possible use against future taxable income in the TRSs.

We have limited experience operating as a REIT, which may adversely affect
our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common stock, ability to forecast dividends and ability to satisfy debt service obligations.

We began operating as a REIT on January 1, 2014 and, as such, have limited operating history as a REIT. In addition, prior to
January 1, 2014 our senior management team had no prior experience operating a REIT. We can provide no assurance that our past experience has sufficiently prepared us to operate successfully as
a REIT. Our inability to operate successfully as a REIT, including the failure to maintain REIT status, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Distributions payable by REITs generally do not qualify for preferential tax
rates.

Qualifying distributions payable by corporations to individuals, trusts and estates that are United States stockholders are currently
eligible for federal income tax at preferential rates. Distributions payable by REITs, in contrast, generally are not eligible for the preferential rates. The preferential rates applicable to regular
corporate distributions could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stock of non-REIT
corporations that pay distributions, which could adversely affect the value of the stock of REITs, including our common stock.

The ownership and transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of
incorporation may not protect our status as a REIT, could have unintended antitakeover effects and may prevent our stockholders from receiving a takeover premium.

In order for us to remain qualified as a REIT, no more than 50% of the value of outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned,
beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year other than the first year for which we elect to be taxed as a REIT. In addition,
rents from "affiliated tenants" will not qualify as qualifying REIT income if we own 10% or more by vote or value of the customer, whether directly or after application of attribution rules under the
Code. Subject to certain exceptions, our certificate of incorporation prohibits any stockholder from owning, beneficially or constructively, more than (i) 9.8% in value of the outstanding
shares of all classes or series of our capital stock or (ii) 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. We
refer to these restrictions collectively as the "ownership limits" and we included them in our certificate of incorporation to facilitate our compliance with REIT tax rules. The constructive ownership
rules under the Code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. As a
result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock (or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock) by an individual or entity could cause that individual
or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits. Any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or of any of our other capital
stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void. Even though our certificate of incorporation contains the
ownership limits, there can be no assurance that these provisions will be effective to prevent our REIT status from being jeopardized, including under the affiliated tenant rule. Furthermore, there
can be no assurance that we will be able



to
monitor and enforce the ownership limits. If the restrictions in our certificate of incorporation are not effective and as a result we fail to satisfy the REIT tax rules described above, then
absent an applicable relief provision, we will fail to remain qualified as a REIT.

In
addition, the ownership and transfer restrictions could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be
in the best interest of our stockholders. As a result, the overall effect of the ownership and transfer restrictions may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us, even if
such acquisition may be favorable to the interests of our stockholders.

The ability of our board of directors to change our major policies without
the consent of stockholders may not be in the interest of our stockholders.

Our board of directors determines our major policies, including policies and guidelines relating to our investments, acquisitions,
leverage, financing, growth, operations and distributions to our stockholders. Our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies and guidelines from time to time without the vote or
consent of our stockholders. Accordingly, our stockholders will have limited control over changes in our policies, and any such changes could adversely affect our financial condition, results of
operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

Operational Risks

Our customers may shift from paper and tape storage to alternative
technologies that require less physical space.

We derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of paper documents and computer backup tapes and from storage related
services. Alternative storage
technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents and tapes, and as alternative technologies are adopted, storage related services may decline as the physical
records or tapes we store become less active and more archived. We can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most or a portion of their records as paper documents or in tape
format. The adoption of alternative technologies may also result in decreased demand for services related to the paper documents and tapes we store. A significant shift by our customers to storage of
data through non-paper or tape-based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses.

As stored records become less active our service revenue growth and
profitability may decline.

Our records management service revenue growth is being negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records are becoming
less active. The amount of information available to customers through the Internet or their own information systems has been steadily increasing in recent years. As a result, while we continue to
experience growth in storage rental, our customers are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records, thereby reducing their service activity levels. At the same time many of our
costs related to records related services remain fixed. In addition, our reputation for providing secure information storage is critical to our success, and actions to manage cost structure, such as
outsourcing certain transportation, security or other functions, could negatively impact our reputation and adversely affect our business. Ultimately, if we are unable to appropriately align our cost
structure with decreased levels of service revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected.



Changes in customer behavior with respect to document destruction and
pricing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We have experienced pricing pressure in recent years as some customers have become more cost conscious with respect to their
information management expenditures. Some customers have taken actions designed to reduce costs associated with the retention of documents, including reducing the volume of documents they store and
adopting more aggressive destruction practices. If we are unable to increase pricing over time, or if rates of destruction of documents stored with us increase substantially, particularly in our
developed and slower growing markets, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.

Governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of
operations. We may not be able to fully offset these costs through increases in our rates. Incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information against security breaches could result in
monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, if we fail to protect our own information,
including information about our employees, we could experience significant costs and expenses as well as damage to our reputation.

In reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, almost all
states in the United States have adopted breach of data security statutes or regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information is breached. In addition,
certain federal laws and regulations affecting financial institutions, health care providers and plans and others impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of information maintained by
those institutions as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. Some of these laws and regulations provide for civil fines in certain
circumstances and require the adoption and maintenance of privacy and information security programs; our failure to be in compliance with any such programs may adversely affect our business. Some
states in the United States have adopted regulations requiring every company that maintains or stores personal information to adopt a comprehensive written information security program. The European
Commission has proposed a regulation and directive that will, if adopted, supersede Directive 95/46/EC, which has governed the processing of personal data since 1995. It is anticipated that the
proposed regulation and directive will significantly alter the security and privacy obligations of entities, such as Iron Mountain, that process data of residents of members of the European Union and
substantially increase penalties for violations. If adopted, we would be directly subject to some of these laws, and our customers, pursuant to agreements, would require us to comply with others.

Continued
governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action in the United States. For example, the recently completed 113

th

Congress
considered legislation that would expand the federal data breach notification requirement beyond the financial and medical fields, and it is anticipated that the 114

th

Congress
will also consider such issues. Also, an increasing number of countries have introduced and/or increased enforcement of comprehensive privacy laws, or are expected to do so. The continued emphasis on
information security as well as increasing concerns about government surveillance may lead customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security and assume higher liability under
our contracts. While we have experienced incidents in which customers' backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed by customers that some of the incidents involved the loss
of personal information, resulting in monetary costs to those customers for which we have provided reimbursement. As a result of legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our
operations with the goal of further improving data security. Any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for
our services sufficiently to offset any increased expenses.

In
addition to increases in the costs of operations or potential liability that may result from a heightened focus on data security or losses of information, our reputation may be
damaged by any



compromise
of security, accidental loss or theft of our own records, or information that we maintain with respect to our employees, as well as customer data in our possession. We believe that
establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers. If our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our
businesses, financial condition or results of operations.

Changing fire and safety standards may result in significant expense in
certain jurisdictions.

As of December 31, 2014, we operated 977 records management and off-site data protection facilities worldwide, including 561 in
the United States. Many of these facilities were built and outfitted by third parties and added to our real estate portfolio as part of acquisitions. Some of these facilities contain fire suppression
and safety features that are different from our current specifications and current standards for new facilities although we believe all of our facilities were constructed, in all material respects, in
compliance with laws and regulations in effect at the time of their construction or outfitting. In some instances local authorities having jurisdiction may take the position that our fire suppression
and safety features in a particular facility are insufficient and require additional measures that may involve considerable expense to us. In addition, where we determine that the fire suppression and
safety features of a facility require improvement, we will develop and implement a plan to remediate the issue, although implementation may require an extended period to complete. If additional fire
safety and suppression measures beyond our current operating plan were required at a large number of our facilities, the expense required for compliance could negatively impact our business, financial
condition or results of operations.

Our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes
contain terms that could lead to disputes in contract interpretation.

Our customer contracts typically contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to,
records or information stored with us. Our liability under physical storage contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot and our liability
under our DMS and other service contracts is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract; however, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts
assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. We cannot provide assurance that where we have limitation of liability provisions they will be enforceable in all instances
or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. In addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage rental and service contracts include a schedule setting
forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and service delivery terms. Our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions
in their contracts. In the past, we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, but we
can provide no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. Although we maintain a comprehensive insurance program, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain
insurance policies on acceptable terms in order to cover losses to us in connection with customer contract disputes.

Failure to comply with certain regulatory and contractual requirements under
our United States Government contracts could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial position.

Selling our services to the United States Government subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. Failure to comply
with these requirements could subject us to investigations, price reductions, up to treble damages, and civil penalties. Noncompliance with certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also
result in us being suspended or barred from future United States Government contracting. We may also face private derivative securities claims as a result of adverse



government
actions. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial position and reputation.

International operations may pose unique risks.

As of December 31, 2014, we provided services in 35 countries outside the United States. As part of our growth strategy, we
expect to continue to acquire or invest in storage and information management services businesses in select foreign markets, including countries where we do not currently operate. International
operations are subject to numerous risks, including:

•

the impact of foreign government regulations and United States regulations that apply to us wherever we operate; in particular, Iron
Mountain is subject to United States and foreign anticorruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, and, although we have implemented internal controls,
policies and procedures and training to deter prohibited practices, our employees, partners, contractors or agents may violate or circumvent such policies and the law;

•

the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate;

•

political uncertainties;

•

unforeseen liabilities, particularly within acquired businesses;

•

costs and difficulties associated with managing international operations of varying sizes and scale;

•

the risk that business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise in some markets
outside of the United States will not perform as expected;

•

difficulties attracting and retaining local management and key employees to operate our business in certain countries;

•

cultural differences and differences in business practices and operating standards; and

•

foreign currency fluctuations.

In
particular, our net income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies associated with certain intercompany balances of our foreign subsidiaries owed to us and between
our foreign subsidiaries.

We have operations in multiple foreign countries and, as a result, are
subject to foreign exchange translation risk, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.

We conduct business operations in several foreign countries through our foreign subsidiaries or affiliates, which operate in their
respective local currencies. Those local currencies are translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. The results of
operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international storage and information management services businesses are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and
as we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. Upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and significant
shifts in foreign currencies can impact our short-term results, as well as our long-term forecasts and targets. In addition, because we intend to distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income to our
stockholders, and any exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our REIT taxable income, our distribution amounts may fluctuate as a result of exchange rate fluctuations.



We may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with
the real estate required for our business.

Because our business is heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. Such
risks include:

•

acquisition and occupancy costs that make it difficult to meet anticipated margins and difficulty locating suitable facilities due to
a relatively small number of available buildings having the desired characteristics in some real estate markets;

•

uninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis for some
casualties, such as fires, earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities;

•

inability to use our real estate holdings effectively and costs associated with vacating or consolidating facilities if the demand for
physical storage were to diminish because our customers choose other storage technologies or because competitors attract our customers; and

•

liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us,
whether or not (i) we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or (ii) the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property.

Some
of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from
nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. In some instances this prior use involved the operation
of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. Where we are aware of environmental
conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. Although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and
remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. We therefore may be potentially liable for
environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. Environmental conditions for which we might be liable
may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. In addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today.

Unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our
reputation and results of operations.

Unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, war or
terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. Our customers rely on us to
securely store and timely retrieve their critical information, and these events could result in customer service disruption, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities and the information
stored in those facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems, each of which could negatively impact our reputation and
results of operations. During the past several years we have seen an increase in severe storms and hurricanes and our key facilities in Florida and other coastal areas in particular are subject to
this inherent risk.

Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our reputation for providing highly secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. Our reputation
or brand, and specifically, the trust our customers place in us, could be negatively impacted in the event of perceived or actual failures by us to store information securely. For example, events such
as fires, natural disasters, attacks on our information technology



systems
or security breaches involving Iron Mountain could negatively impact our reputation, particularly if such incidents result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation.
Damage to our reputation could make us less competitive, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and
results of operations.

Our operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. In particular, our secure
shredding operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper to recyclers. We generate additional revenue through a customer surcharge when the price of diesel fuel rises above certain
predetermined rates. As a result, significant declines in paper and diesel fuel prices may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations, and increases in other commodity prices, including
steel, may negatively impact our results of operations.

Attacks on our internal information technology systems could damage our
reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations.

Our reputation for providing secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. We have previously
faced attempts by unauthorized users to gain access to our information technology systems and expect to continue to face such attempts. Although we seek to prevent, detect and investigate these
security incidents and have taken steps to prevent such security breaches, our information technology and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee
error, malfeasance or other disruptions. A successful breach of the security of our information technology systems could lead to theft or misuse of our customers' proprietary or confidential
information and result in third party claims against us and reputational harm. If our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial
condition or results of operations.

We may be subject to claims that our technology violates the intellectual
property rights of a third party.

Third parties may have legal rights (including ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights) to ideas, materials,
processes, names or original works that are the same or similar to those we use. Third parties have in the past, and may in the future, bring claims, or threaten to bring claims, against us that
allege that their intellectual property rights are being infringed or violated by our use of intellectual property. Litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior
management from operating our business. Further, if we cannot establish our right or obtain the right to use the intellectual property on reasonable terms, we may be required to develop alternative
intellectual property at our expense to mitigate potential harm.

We face competition for customers.

We compete with multiple storage and information management services providers in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or
potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. We also compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information
management services capabilities. These organizations may not begin or continue to use us for their future storage and information management service needs.



Risks Related to Our Indebtedness

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and
prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments.

We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, our total long-term debt was approximately
$4.66 billion. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our current and potential investors. These risks include:

•

inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments;

•

inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions;

•

inability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements, including
possible required repurchases of our various indebtedness;

•

limits on our distributions to stockholders; in this regard if these limits prevented us from satisfying our REIT distribution
requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT or, if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing
100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on the retained amounts;

•

limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information management services industry;

•

limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness
or to fund our other liquidity needs;

•

loss of customers and reduced effectiveness in attracting new customers due to concerns over the levels of our debt or concern over
financial ratios that are negatively impacted by our requirement to make large distributions as a REIT and the impact of these on our operations;

•

inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; and

•

restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms.

Restrictive debt covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth
strategy.

Our credit facility and our indentures contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other
things:

•

incur additional indebtedness;

•

pay dividends or make other restricted payments;

•

make asset dispositions;

•

create or permit liens; and

•

make acquisitions and other investments.

These
restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies.

We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the
repurchase of outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes upon a change of control event as required by our indentures.

Upon the occurrence of a "change of control", we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior or senior subordinated
notes. However, it is possible that we will not have sufficient



funds
at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes or that restrictions in our revolving credit facility will not allow such repurchases. Certain important
corporate events, however, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a "change of control" under our indentures.

Iron Mountain is a holding company, and, therefore, our ability to make
payments on our various debt obligations depends in part on the operations of our subsidiaries.

Iron Mountain is a holding company; substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our subsidiaries, and substantially all of
our operations are conducted by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of
sufficient funds from our subsidiaries. However, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by most, but not all, of our direct and indirect
wholly owned United States subsidiaries.

Acquisition and Expansion Risks

Elements of our strategic growth plan involve inherent risks.

As part of our strategic growth plan, we expect to invest in new business strategies, products, services, technologies and geographies
and we may selectively divest certain businesses. These initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenues
to offset expenses and liabilities associated with new investments, inadequate return of capital on these investments and the inability to attract, develop and retain skilled employees to lead and
support new initiatives. For example, in 2013 we expanded our entry into the data center market by leasing wholesale and retail colocation space in our underground facility in Pennsylvania, and in
2014 we opened our first regional data center in Massachusetts, each of which required a significant capital commitment. Many of these new ventures are inherently risky and we can provide no assurance
that such strategies and offerings will be successful in achieving the desired returns within a reasonable timeframe, if at all, and that they will not adversely affect our business, reputation,
financial condition, and operating results.

Failure to manage our growth may impact operating results.

If we succeed in expanding our existing businesses, or in moving into new areas of business, that expansion may place increased demands
on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. If not managed effectively, these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to
customers. In addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support future operations, particularly with respect to operations in countries outside of the United
States or in new lines of business. Consequently, in order to manage growth effectively, we may be required to increase expenditures to increase our physical resources, expand, train and manage our
employee base, improve management, financial and information systems and controls, or make other capital expenditures. Our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter
difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth.

Failure to successfully integrate acquired operations could negatively
impact our balance sheet and results of operations.

Strategic acquisitions are an important element of our growth strategy and the success of any acquisition we make depends in part on
our ability to integrate the acquired company and realize anticipated synergies. The process of integrating acquired businesses, particularly in new markets, may involve unforeseen difficulties and
may require a disproportionate amount of our management's



attention
and our financial and other resources. We can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business or realize
anticipated synergies. The failure to successfully integrate the cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies of an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on
our balance sheet and results of operations.

We may be unable to continue our international expansion.

An important part of our growth strategy involves expanding operations in international markets, including in markets where we
currently do not operate, and we expect to continue this expansion. Europe, Latin America and Australia have been our primary areas of focus for international expansion, and we have expanded into the
Asia Pacific region to a lesser extent. We have entered into joint ventures and have acquired all or a majority of the equity in storage and information management services businesses operating in
these areas and may acquire other storage and information management services businesses in the future, including in new countries/markets where we currently do not operate.

This
growth strategy involves risks. We may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future at the desired pace or at all. For example, we may be unable
to:

•

identify suitable companies to acquire or invest in;

•

complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms;

•

successfully expand our infrastructure and sales force to support growth;

•

achieve satisfactory returns on acquired companies, particularly in countries where we do not currently operate;

•

incur additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay the purchase price out of working capital,
common stock or other equity securities; or

•

enter into successful business arrangements for technical assistance or management expertise outside of the United States.

We
also compete with other storage and information management services providers for companies to acquire. Some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources.
If any such competitor were to devote additional resources to pursue such acquisition candidates or focus its strategy on our international markets, the purchase price for potential acquisitions or
investments could rise, competition in international markets could increase and our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2. Properties.

As of December 31, 2014, we conducted operations through 839 leased facilities and 255 facilities that we own. Our facilities
are divided among our reportable segments as follows: North American Records and Information Management Business (614), North American Data Management Business (58), International Business
(421) and Corporate and Other (1). These facilities contain a total of 67.8 million square feet of space.

The
leased facilities typically have initial lease terms of five to ten years with one or more five-year renewal options. In addition, some of the leases contain either a purchase option
or a right of first refusal upon the sale of the property. We believe that the space available in our facilities is adequate to meet our current needs, although future growth may require that we lease
or purchase additional real property.



See
Note 10 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding our minimum annual lease commitments.

See
Schedule III—Schedule of Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation in this Annual Report for information regarding the cost, accumulated depreciation and
encumbrances associated with our owned real estate.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

We are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. A portion of the defense and/or settlement costs
associated with such litigation is covered by various commercial liability insurance policies purchased by us and, in limited cases, indemnification from third parties. In the opinion of management,
no material legal proceedings are pending to which we, or any of our properties, are subject.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.

None.

The
closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on February 20, 2015 was $36.71. As of February 20, 2015, there were 439 holders of record of our common stock.

On
September 15, 2014, we announced the declaration by our board of directors of a special distribution of $700.0 million (the "Special Distribution"), payable to
stockholders of record as of September 30, 2014 (the "Record Date"). The Special Distribution represented the remaining amount of our undistributed earnings and profits attributable to all
taxable periods ending on or prior to December 31, 2013, which in accordance with tax rules applicable to REIT conversions, we were required to pay to our stockholders on or before
December 31, 2014 in connection with our conversion to a REIT. The Special Distribution also included certain items of taxable income that we recognized in 2014, such as depreciation recapture
in respect of accounting method changes commenced in our pre-REIT period as well as foreign earnings and profits recognized as dividend income. The Special Distribution followed an initial special
distribution of $700.0 million paid to stockholders in November 2012.

The
Special Distribution was paid on November 4, 2014 (the "Payment Date") to stockholders of record as of the Record Date in a combination of common stock and cash. Stockholders
had the right to elect to be paid their pro rata portion of the Special Distribution in all common stock or all cash, with the total cash payment to stockholders limited to no more than
$140.0 million, or 20% of the total Special Distribution, not including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. Based on stockholder elections, we paid $140.0 million of the Special
Distribution in cash, not including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, with the balance paid in the form of common stock. Our shares of common stock were valued for purposes of the Special
Distribution based upon the average closing price on the three trading days following October 24, 2014, or $35.55 per share, and as such, we issued approximately 15.8 million shares of
common stock in the Special Distribution. These shares impact weighted average shares outstanding from the date of issuance, and thus impact our earnings per share data prospectively from the Payment
Date.

In
November 2014, our board of directors declared a distribution of $0.255 per share (the "Catch-Up Distribution") payable on December 15, 2014 to stockholders of record on
November 28, 2014. Our board of directors declared the Catch-Up Distribution because our cash distributions paid from January 2014 through July 2014 were declared and paid before our board of
directors had



determined
that we would elect REIT status effective January 1, 2014 and were lower than they otherwise would have been if the final determination to elect REIT status effective
January 1, 2014 had been prior to such distributions.

In
February 2010, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we have paid, and in the future intend to pay, quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Declaration
and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors. In 2013 and 2014, our board of directors declared the following dividends:

During
the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, we declared distributions to our stockholders of $886.9 million, $206.4 million and $1,048.9 million,
respectively. These distributions
represent approximately $5.12 per share, $1.08 per share and $5.37 per share for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively, based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during each respective year. For each of 2012 and 2014, total amounts distributed included Special Distributions (as described above) of $700.0 million, or $4.07 and $3.61
per share, respectively, associated with the Company's conversion to a REIT.

For
federal income tax purposes, distributions to our stockholders are generally treated as nonqualified ordinary dividends, qualified ordinary dividends or return of capital. The IRS
requires historical C corporation earnings and profits to be distributed prior to any REIT distributions, which may affect the character of each distribution to our stockholders, including whether and
to what extent each distribution is characterized as a qualified or nonqualified ordinary dividend. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the dividends we paid on our common
shares were classified as follows:

In
December 2013, our board of directors approved, and we entered into, a REIT Status Protection Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") which provided for a dividend of one preferred
stock purchase right (a "Right") for each share of our common stock outstanding on December 20,



2013.
On November 18, 2014, we entered into the First Amendment to the Rights Agreement to extend the expiration of the Rights Agreement from December 9, 2014 to February 28,
2015. On January 20, 2015, in connection with the merger with our predecessor, the Rights Agreement was terminated.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

We did not sell any unregistered securities during the three months ended December 31, 2014, nor did we repurchase any shares of
our common stock during the three months ended December 31, 2014.

During
the second quarter of 2014, we identified contract billing inaccuracies arising from a single location which occurred over numerous years that
resulted in an overstatement of prior years' reported revenue by an aggregate of $10.0 million, as described in Note 2.y. to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
this Annual Report. Revenue and Adjusted OIBDA,



as
defined below, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 have been restated to reflect a reduction in revenues of $1.2 million, $1.1 million,
$1.3 million and $1.3 million, respectively, to correct billing the billing inaccuracies. The remaining overstated amount of $5.1 million relates to the periods prior to 2010. The
impact to income from continuing operations and net income is a reduction of $0.7 million, $0.7 million, $0.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for the after tax
impact of the contract billing inaccuracies for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Earnings (loss) per share—basic and earnings (loss) per
share—diluted have
also been restated to reflect the restatement. In addition, total equity at December 31, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 has been reduced by $3.8 million, $4.5 million,
$5.3 million and $6.1 million, respectively, to account for the contract billing inaccuracies.

(2)

As
a result of our conversion to a REIT and in accordance with SEC rules applicable to REITs, we no longer report (gain) loss on sale of real estate as a
component of operating income, but we will continue to report it as a component of income (loss) from continuing operations. We will continue to report the (gain) loss on sale of property, plant and
equipment (excluding real estate), along with any impairment, write-downs or involuntary conversions related to real estate, as a component of operating income. The results for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.

(3)

For
the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $85.9 million related to our technology escrow
services business, which we continue to own and operate and which was previously reflected in the former worldwide digital business segment and is now reflected as a component of the North American
Records and Information Management segment. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a $197.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to our former worldwide digital
business that is included in loss from discontinued operations, net of tax. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $46.5 million in
our Continental Western Europe reporting unit, which is a component of the International Business segment.

Adjusted
OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin are non-GAAP measures. Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible
impairments, (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net (excluding real estate), and REIT Costs (as defined below). Adjusted OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing
Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. For a more detailed definition and reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA and a discussion of why we believe these non-GAAP measures provide relevant and useful information
to our current and potential investors, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Measures" of this Annual Report.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of  Operations.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" and the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

This
discussion contains "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other securities laws. See "Cautionary Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" on page iii of this Annual Report and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" beginning on page 13 of this Annual Report.



Overview

REIT Conversion

We previously disclosed that, as part of our plan to convert to a REIT for federal income tax purposes and elect REIT status effective
January 1, 2014 (the "Conversion Plan"), we sought PLRs from the IRS relating to numerous technical tax issues, including classification of our steel racking structures as qualified real estate
assets. We submitted the PLR requests in the third quarter of 2012, and on June 25, 2014, we announced that we received the favorable PLRs from the IRS necessary for our conversion to a REIT.
After receipt of the PLRs, our board of directors unanimously approved our conversion to a REIT for our taxable year beginning January 1, 2014.

In
connection with the Conversion Plan, and, in particular, to impose ownership limitations customary for REITs, on January 20, 2015, we completed the merger with our predecessor
and all outstanding shares of our predecessor's common stock were converted into a right to receive an equal number of shares of our common stock.

Total
operating and capital expenditures associated with the Conversion Plan through the end of 2014 were approximately $180.7 million. Of these amounts, approximately
$47.0 million was incurred in 2012, including approximately $12.5 million of capital expenditures. Additionally, approximately $106.3 million was incurred in 2013, including
approximately $23.4 million of capital expenditures. Also, we incurred approximately $27.4 million in 2014, including approximately $5.1 million of capital expenditures.

Discontinued Operations

On April 27, 2012, we sold our records management operations in Italy. The financial position, operating results and cash flows
of our Italian operations, including the loss on the sale of our Italian operations, for all periods presented, have been reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. See
Note 14 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.

In
December 2014, we divested our secure shredding operations in Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom (the "International Shredding Operations") in a stock transaction for
approximately $26.2 million of cash at closing, including $1.5 million being held in escrow. The assets sold primarily consisted of customer contracts and certain long-lived assets. We
have concluded that this divestiture is not a discontinued operation and, therefore, have recorded a pretax gain on sale in other (income) expense, net of approximately $6.9 million
($10.2 million, inclusive of a tax benefit) in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues from our International Shredding Operations in 2014
represent less than 1% of our consolidated revenues. The International Shredding Operations were previously included in our International Business segment.

Restructuring

In the third quarter of 2013, we implemented a plan that called for certain organizational realignments to advance our growth strategy
and reduce operating costs, which was completed in 2014. As a result, we recorded restructuring costs of approximately $23.4 million and $3.5 million for the years ended
December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, primarily related to employee severance and associated benefits. Of the total restructuring costs incurred in 2013, $12.6 million,
$2.1 million, $3.7 million and $5.0 million are reflected in the North American Records and Information Management Business, North American Data Management Business, International
Business and Corporate and Other segments, respectively. Of the total restructuring costs incurred in 2014, $1.6 million, $0.3 million and $1.5 million are reflected in the North
American Records and Information Management Business, North American Data Management Business and Corporate and



Other
segments, respectively. In our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2013, $20.0 million and $3.4 million of these restructuring costs are
recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and cost of sales, respectively. In our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2014, $2.2 million
and $1.2 million of these restructuring costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and cost of sales, respectively.

General

As a result of certain organizational realignments effective January 1, 2014, we evaluated changes to our internal financial
reporting to better align our internal reporting to how we will manage our business going forward. This evaluation resulted in changes to our reportable segments effective January 1, 2014 and,
as a result, we have restated previously reported segment information. As a result of the changes to our reportable segments, the former North American Business segment was separated into two unique
reportable segments, which we refer to as (1) North American Records and Information Management Business segment and (2) North American Data Management Business segment. In addition, the
Emerging Businesses segment, which was previously reported as a component of the former North American Business segment, is now reported as a component of the Corporate and Other segment.

Our
revenues consist of storage rental revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes. Storage rental revenues, which are considered a key
driver of financial performance for the storage and information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic rental charges related to the storage of materials or data
(generally on a per unit basis) that are typically retained by customers for many years. Service revenues include charges for related service activities, which include: (1) the handling of
records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records and the destruction of records; (2) courier operations, consisting
primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents and the related sale of recycled paper, the price of which can fluctuate from
period to period; (4) other services, including DMS, which relate to physical and digital records, and project revenues; (5) customer termination and permanent withdrawal fees;
(6) data restoration projects; (7) special project work; (8) fulfillment services; (9) consulting services; and (10) technology escrow services that protect and
manage source code ("Intellectual Property
Management") and other technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). Our service revenue growth has been negatively impacted by
declining activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. While customers continue to store their records with us, they are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records
for research purposes, thereby reducing service activity levels.

Cost
of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities),
transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most
significant. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing
personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in facility occupancy costs are
impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels
of utilization of these properties. Trends in total wages and benefits in dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels,
achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers' compensation.



The expansion of our international businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components and selling, general and administrative expenses. Our international
operations are more labor intensive than our operations in North America and, therefore, labor costs are a higher percentage of segment revenue. In addition, the overhead structure of our expanding
international operations has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage as our North American segments, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a
percentage of consolidated revenue, as our international operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results.

Our
depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital-intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which
include racking structures, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationship acquisition costs and is
impacted by the nature and timing of acquisitions.

Our
consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the
United States. It is difficult to predict the future fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and how those fluctuations will impact our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Due to the
expansion of our international operations, some of these fluctuations have become material on individual balances. However, because both the revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency
of the country in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income and operating margin
is partially mitigated. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percentage change in
the results from one period to another period in this report using constant currency presentation. The constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2012 results at the 2013 average
exchange rates and the 2013 results at the 2014 average exchange rates.

The
following table is a comparison of underlying average exchange rates of the foreign currencies that had the most significant impact on our United States dollar-reported revenues and
expenses:

Non-GAAP Measures

Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation, Amortization, Intangible Impairments, (Gain) Loss on Disposal/Write-Down of Property, Plant and Equipment (Excluding Real
Estate), Net and REIT Costs ("Adjusted OIBDA")

Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments, (gain) loss on
disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net and REIT Costs (as defined below). Adjusted OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues.
We use multiples of current or projected Adjusted OIBDA in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We
believe Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin provide our current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding our ability to generate cash flow to support business
investment. These measures are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. Adjusted OIBDA does not include certain items
that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net;
(2) (gain) loss on sale of real estate, net of tax; (3) intangible impairments; (4) REIT Costs; (5) other expense (income), net; (6) income (loss) from discontinued
operations, net of tax; (7) gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax; and (8) net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Adjusted
OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision (benefit) for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which
we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, Adjusted OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact
of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin should be
considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP"), such as operating or net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP).

Adjusted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations ("Adjusted EPS")

Adjusted EPS is defined as reported earnings per share from continuing operations excluding: (1) (gain) loss on
disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net; (2) (gain) loss on sale of real estate, net of tax; (3) intangible impairments; (4) REIT Costs;
(5) other expense (income), net; and (6) the tax impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items. We do not believe these excluded items to be indicative of our ongoing operating
results, and they are not considered when we are forecasting our future results. We believe Adjusted EPS is of value to our current and potential investors when comparing our results from past,
present and future periods.

The
Adjusted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 have been restated to reflect an estimated annual effective tax rate of
approximately 15.0%. The Adjusted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects an estimated annual effective tax rate of approximately 14.4%.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate
the estimates used. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order:

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues consist of storage rental revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes.
Storage rental revenues, which are considered a key driver of financial performance for the storage and information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic rental charges
related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit



basis).
Service revenues include charges for related service activities, which include: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from
storage, refiling of removed records and the destruction of records; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure
shredding of sensitive documents and the related sale of recycled paper, the price of which can fluctuate from period to period; (4) other services, including DMS, which relate to physical and
digital records, and project revenues; (5) customer termination and permanent withdrawal fees; (6) data restoration projects; (7) special project work; (8) fulfillment
services; (9) consulting services; and (10) Intellectual Property Management and other technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related
supplies).

We
recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage rental and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage rental or service is provided, and customers
are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms. Amounts related to future storage rental or prepaid service contracts for customers where storage rental fees or services
are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the period the applicable storage rental or service is provided or performed. Revenues from the sales of
products, which are included as a component of service revenues, are recognized when products are shipped and title has passed to the customer. Revenues from the sales of products have historically
not been significant.

Accounting for Acquisitions

Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition by us of numerous businesses. The purchase price of each acquisition has been
determined after due diligence of the target business, market research, strategic planning and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies
are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources.

Each
acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition. Accounting for
these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the
assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment based on the final assessments of the fair value of intangible assets (primarily
customer relationship intangible assets), property, plant and equipment (primarily racking structures), operating leases, contingencies and income taxes (primarily deferred income taxes). We complete
these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a description of recent acquisitions.

Determining
the fair values of the net assets acquired requires management's judgment and often involves the use of assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount
rates and market data, among other items. Due to the inherent uncertainty of future events, actual values of net assets acquired could be different from our estimated fair values and could have a
material impact on our financial statements.

Of
the net assets acquired in our acquisitions, the fair value of owned buildings, customer relationship intangible assets, racking structures and operating leases are generally the most
common and most significant. For significant acquisitions or acquisitions involving new markets or new products, we generally use third party appraisals of the fair value of owned buildings, customer
relationship
intangible assets and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. For acquisitions that are not significant or do not involve new markets or new products, we generally use third party
appraisals of



fair
value for acquired owned buildings and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. When not using third party appraisals of the fair value of acquired net assets, the fair value of
acquired customer relationship intangible assets and acquired racking structures is determined internally. The fair value of acquired racking structures is determined internally by taking current
replacement cost at the date of acquisition for the quantity of racking structures acquired, discounted to take into account the quality (e.g. age, material and type) of the racking structures.
Additionally, we use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of customer relationship intangible assets, which requires a significant amount of judgment by management, including
estimating expected lives of the relationships, expected future cash flows and discount rates.

Of
the key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values of customer relationship intangible assets, the expected future cash flows and discount rate are among the most sensitive and
are considered to be critical assumptions. To illustrate the sensitivity of changes in key assumptions used in determining the fair value of customer relationship intangible assets acquired in our
most significant acquisitions in fiscal year 2014 (Keepers Brasil Ltda and Securit Records Management), a hypothetical increase of 10% in the expected annual future cash flows attributable to
these two acquisitions, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have increased the calculated fair value of the acquired customer relationship intangible assets in the aggregate for both of these
acquisitions combined by $2.6 million, with an offsetting decrease to goodwill. A hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the discount rate, with all other assumptions unchanged, would
have increased the fair value of the acquired customer relationship intangible assets in the aggregate for both of these acquisitions combined by $1.7 million, with an offsetting decrease to
goodwill.

Our
estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or
inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy of such assumptions.

Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets

Assets subject to depreciation or amortization:

We review long-lived assets and all
amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Examples of events or
circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include, but are not limited to:

•

A significant decrease in the market price of an asset;

•

A significant change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;

•

A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset;

•

An accumulation of costs significantly greater than the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;
and

•

A current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its
previously estimated useful life.

Recoverability
of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations
are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, the
long-lived assets are written down, on a pro rata basis, to fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets.



Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization:

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are
reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Other than goodwill, we currently have no intangible assets that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized.

We
have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2012, 2013 and 2014 and
concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of those dates. Based on our goodwill impairment assessment, all of our reporting units with goodwill had estimated fair values as of October 1, 2014
that exceeded their carrying values by greater than 15%. As of December 31, 2014, no factors were identified that would alter our October 1, 2014 goodwill assessment. In making this
assessment, we relied on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to
these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the
reporting units affected based on their relative fair values.

Our
reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2013 were as follows: (1) North America; (2) United Kingdom,
Ireland, Norway, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain ("Western Europe"); (3) the remaining countries in Europe in which we operate, excluding Russia and Ukraine
("Emerging Markets"); (4) Latin America; (5) Australia, China, Hong Kong and Singapore ("Asia Pacific"); and (6) India, Russia and Ukraine ("Emerging Market Joint Ventures"). The
carrying value of goodwill, net for each of these reporting units as of December 31, 2013 is as follows (in thousands):

Beginning
January 1, 2014, as a result of the changes in our reportable segments associated with our reorganization (see Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in this Annual Report for a description of our reportable operating segments), we now have 12 reporting units. Our North American Records and Information Management Business
segment includes the following three reporting units: (1) North American Records and Information Management; (2) Intellectual Property Management; and (3) Fulfillment Services.
The North American Data Management Business segment is a separate reporting unit. The Emerging Businesses reporting unit (which primarily relates to our data center business in the United States and
which is a component of Corporate and Other) is also a reporting unit. Additionally, the International Business segment consists of the following seven
reporting units: (1) United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland ("New Western Europe"); (2) the remaining
countries in Europe in which we operate, excluding Russia, Ukraine and Denmark ("New Emerging Markets"); (3) Latin America; (4) Australia and Singapore; (5) China and Hong Kong
("Greater China"); (6) India; and (7) Russia, Ukraine and Denmark. We have reassigned goodwill associated with the reporting units impacted by the reorganization among the new reporting
units on a relative fair value basis. The fair value of each of our new reporting units was determined based on the application of a combined weighted average approach of fair value multiples of
revenue and earnings and discounted cash flow techniques.



As
a result of the change in the composition of our reporting units noted above, we concluded that we had an interim triggering event, and, therefore, we performed an interim goodwill
impairment test as of January 1, 2014 on the basis of these new reporting units during the first quarter of 2014. We concluded that the goodwill for each of our new reporting units was not
impaired as of such date. The carrying value of goodwill, net for each of these reporting units as of December 31, 2014 is as follows (in thousands):

Reporting
unit valuations have been determined using a combined approach based on the present value of future cash flows and market multiples of revenues and earnings. The income
approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting
these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. In conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment reviews, we reconcile the sum of the valuations of all of our reporting
units to our market capitalization as of such dates.

Although
we believe we have sufficient historical and projected information available to us to test for impairment, it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates
used in our impairment tests. Of the key assumptions that impact the goodwill impairment test, the expected future cash flows and discount rate are among the most sensitive and are considered to be
critical assumptions, as changes to these estimates could have an effect on the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units. As a measure of sensitivity, we have grouped each of our reporting
units according to the amount by which each reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value in the goodwill impairment test. A hypothetical decrease of 10% in the expected annual future cash
flows, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have decreased the fair value of our reporting units as of October 1, 2014 by a range of approximately 9.1% to 10.4% but would not, however,
have resulted in the carrying value of any of our reporting units with goodwill exceeding their fair value. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate, with all other assumptions
unchanged, would have decreased the fair value of our reporting units as of October 1, 2014 by a range of approximately 3.9% to 11.6% but would not, however, have resulted in the carrying value
of any of our reporting units with goodwill exceeding their fair value.

Income Taxes

As a REIT, we are generally permitted to deduct from our federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders. The income
represented by such dividends is not subject to federal taxation at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. The income of our domestic TRSs,



which
hold our domestic operations that may not be REIT-compliant as currently operated and structured, is subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. In addition, we and our
subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through subsidiaries disregarded
for federal tax purposes or TRSs. We will also be subject to a separate corporate income tax on any gains recognized during a specified period (generally ten years) following the REIT conversion that
are attributable to "built-in" gains with respect to the assets that we owned on January 1, 2014; this built-in gains tax will also be imposed on our depreciation recapture recognized into
income in 2014 and subsequent taxable years as a result of accounting method changes commenced in our pre-REIT period. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to
federal income tax at regular corporate tax rates. Even if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in
addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRS operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for REITs, many states do not completely follow
federal rules and some do not follow them at all.

Accounting
for income taxes requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and
financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when recovery of deferred tax assets does not meet the more likely than not
standards as defined in GAAP.

We
have federal net operating loss carryforwards, which expire in 2021 through 2033, of $88.1 million ($0, tax effected) at December 31, 2014 to reduce future federal
taxable income, on which no federal tax benefit is expected to be realized. We have state net operating loss carryforwards, which expire in 2015 through 2033, of $74.4 million
($0.1 million, tax effected) at December 31, 2014 to reduce future state taxable income, on which an insignificant state tax benefit is expected to be realized. We have assets for
foreign net operating losses of $64.6 million, with various expiration dates (and in some cases no expiration date), subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 62%. If actual results
differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets, and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we
believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material
impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.

The
evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a measurement process whereby
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to
recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

We
are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have
business operations or a taxable presence. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2013
and 2014, we had approximately $51.1 million and $56.0 million, respectively, of reserves related to uncertain tax positions. The reversal of these reserves will be recorded as a
reduction of our income tax provision if sustained. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in
our estimates.



We
had not previously provided incremental federal and certain state income taxes on net tax over book outside basis differences related to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries
because our intent, prior to our conversion to a REIT, was to reinvest our current and future undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the United States. As a result
of our conversion to a REIT, it is no longer our intent to indefinitely reinvest our current and future undistributed foreign earnings outside the United States, and, therefore, during 2014, we
recognized an increase in our tax provision from continuing operations in the amount of $46.4 million, representing incremental federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on
such foreign earnings. As a REIT, future repatriation of incremental undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will not be subject to federal or state income tax, with the exception of
foreign withholding taxes in limited instances; however, such future repatriations will require distribution in accordance with REIT distribution rules, and any such distribution may then be taxable,
as appropriate, at the stockholder level.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-08,

Presentation of Financial Statements
(Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360)

("ASU 2014-08"). ASU 2014-08 changes the criteria for a
disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires additional disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued
operation. ASU 2014-08 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. Under this guidance, we expect fewer dispositions to qualify as discontinued operations. Early
adoption is permitted, but only for disposals that have not been reported in the financial statements previously issued. We adopted ASU 2014-08 effective April 1, 2014.

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)

("ASU 2014-09"). ASU 2014-09
provides additional guidance for management to reassess revenue recognition as it relates to: (1) transfer of control, (2) variable consideration, (3) allocation of transaction
price based on relative standalone selling price, (3) licenses, (4) time value of money and (5) contract costs. Further disclosures will be required to provide a better
understanding of revenue that has been recognized and revenue that is expected to be recognized in the future from existing contracts. ASU 2014-09 is effective for us on January 1, 2017, with
no early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,

Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)

("ASU
2014-15"). ASU 2014-15 requires management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles of current United States auditing
standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term "substantial doubt", (2) require an evaluation every reporting period, including interim periods,
(3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of
management's plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is still present, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date
that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). ASU 2014-15 is effective for us on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We do not believe that this
pronouncement will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,

Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis

("ASU
2015-02"). ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for us on January 1, 2016, with
early adoption permitted. We do not believe that this pronouncement will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2013 results at the 2014 average exchange rates and the 2012 results at the 2013 average
exchange rates.

(2)

Our
internal revenue growth rate represents the weighted average year-over-year growth rate of our revenues after removing the effects of acquisitions,
divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations.

Consolidated
storage rental revenues increased $75.5 million, or 4.2%, to $1,860.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $51.6 million, or 3.0%, to
$1,784.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The growth rate for the year ended
December 31, 2014 consists primarily of internal revenue growth of 2.2%. Net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 3.2% of the increase in reported storage rental revenues in 2014 over 2013.
Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported storage rental revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately 1.2%. Our consolidated storage rental
revenue growth in 2014 was driven by sustained storage rental internal growth of 0.3%, 2.3% and 6.3% in our North American Records and Information Management Business, North American Data Management
Business and International Business segments, respectively. Global records management net volumes in 2014 increased by 3.6% over the ending volume at December 31, 2013, supported by 12.3%
volume increases in our International Business segment, which was driven by growth from both emerging and developed markets as well as recent acquisitions. The growth rate for the year ended
December 31, 2013 consists primarily of internal revenue growth of 2.1%. Net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 1.5% of the increase in reported storage rental revenues in 2013 over 2012.
Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported storage rental revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately 0.6%. Our consolidated storage rental
revenue growth in 2013 was driven by sustained storage rental internal growth of 0.4%, 1.5% and 6.2% in our North
American Records and Information Management Business, North American Data Management Business and International Business segments, respectively.

Consolidated
service revenues increased $17.5 million, or 1.4%, to $1,257.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $1,239.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2013. Service revenue internal growth was negative 0.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The negative service revenue internal growth for 2014 reflects a trend
toward reduced retrieval/re-file activity and a related decrease in transportation revenues within our North American Records and Information Management Business segment, as well as continued declines
in service revenue activity levels in our North American



Data
Management Business segment as the storage business becomes more archival in nature. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported total service revenues by 1.4% in 2014 over
2013. Net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 3.5% of the increase of reported service revenues in 2014. Consolidated service revenues decreased $30.9 million, or 2.4%, to
$1,239.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 from $1,270.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Service revenue internal growth was negative 3.4% for the
year ended December 31, 2013. The negative service revenue internal growth for 2013 reflects a trend toward reduced retrieval/re-file activity and a related decrease in transportation revenues
within our North American Records and Information Management Business segment, as well as continued declines in service revenue activity levels in our North American Data Management Business segment
as the storage business becomes more archival in nature. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased reported service revenues by 0.8% in 2013 over 2012. Net acquisitions/divestitures
partially offset the decrease in reported consolidated service revenues and contributed an increase of 1.8% of reported service revenues in 2013.

For
the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $93.1 million, or 3.1%, to $3,117.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from
$3,024.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Internal revenue growth was 1.0% for 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
decreased our reported consolidated revenues by 1.2% primarily due to the weakening of the Australian dollar, Brazilian real and Canadian dollar against the United States dollar, partially offset by a
strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Euro against the United States dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Net acquisitions/divestitures
contributed an increase of 3.3% of total reported revenues in 2014 over the same period in 2013. Our consolidated revenues increased $20.7 million, or 0.7%, to $3,024.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2013 from $3,004.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Internal revenue growth was negative 0.2% for 2013. For the year ended December 31,
2013, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our consolidated revenues by 0.7% primarily due to the weakening of the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling and
Canadian dollar, offset by an increase of the Euro against the United States dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Net acquisitions/divestitures partially
offset the decrease in reported consolidated revenues and contributed an increase of 1.6% of total reported revenues in 2013 over the same period in 2012.

We
expect our consolidated internal revenue growth rate for 2015 to be approximately 0% to 2%. During the past eight quarters our storage rental revenue internal growth rate has ranged
between 1.3% and 3.5%. Storage rental revenue internal growth rates have been relatively stable over the past eight quarters, averaging between 2.1% and 2.2% for full-year 2013 and 2014. At various
points in the economic cycle, storage rental internal growth may be influenced by changes in pricing and volume. Recently, we initiated sales force programs focused on increasing volume through new
sales and improved customer retention. In addition, we are working on enhancing our pricing strategy through implementing a statistically based approach, which enables customized pricing based on
customer profiles and needs. Within our International Business segment, the developed markets are generating consistent low-to-mid single-digit storage rental revenue growth, and the emerging markets
are producing strong double-digit storage rental revenue growth by capturing the first-time outsourcing



trends
for physical records storage and management in those markets. The internal revenue growth rate for service revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage rental revenue internal growth
rate due to the more discretionary nature of certain services we offer, such as large special projects, and, as a commodity, the volatility of pricing for recycled paper. These revenues, which are
often event-driven and impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of certain services as a way to reduce their short-term costs, may be difficult to
replicate in future periods. The internal growth rate for total service revenues reflects the following: (1) consistent pressures on activity-based service revenues related to the handling and
transportation of items in storage in the North American Records and Information Management Business and the North American Data
Management Business segments and secure shredding revenues; and (2) softness in some of our other service lines, such as fulfillment services.

Labor

Labor expense increased to 21.6% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 21.1% for the year
ended December 31, 2013. Labor expense for
the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by 7.7% on a constant dollar basis compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to incremental labor costs associated with
acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013, as well as merit increases, partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in restructuring costs. Labor costs were
favorably impacted by 2.0 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2014.



Labor
expense increased to 21.1% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 20.8% for the year ended December 31, 2012. Labor expense for the
year ended December 31, 2013 increased by 3.1% on a constant dollar basis compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to $10.7 million of incremental labor costs
associated with fiscal year 2013 acquisitions, as well as $3.4 million of restructuring costs that were incurred in 2013. Labor costs were favorably impacted by 1.1 percentage points due
to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2013.

Facilities

Facilities costs increased to 14.1% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 13.7% for the
year ended December 31, 2013. Rent expense, which, on a constant dollar basis, increased by $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2013, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013. Other facilities costs increased by $19.9 million on a
constant dollar basis for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to higher utilities of $4.0 million and building maintenance
costs of $6.5 million, as well as higher insurance costs of $3.5 million associated with a fire at one of our facilities in Buenos Aires, Argentina on February 5, 2014 (described
at Note 10.g. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report). Facilities costs were favorably impacted by 1.0 percentage points due to currency rate
changes during the year ended December 31, 2014.

Facilities
costs decreased to 13.7% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to 14.0% for the year ended December 31, 2012. The largest
component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which, on a constant dollar basis, decreased by $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2012 as a result of our ongoing facility consolidation efforts. This decrease was partially offset by $4.8 million of costs associated with 2013 acquisitions. Facilities
costs were favorably impacted by 0.9 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2013.

Transportation

Transportation expenses decreased by $3.2 million on a constant dollar basis during the year ended December 31, 2014
compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily as a result of decreased fuel and maintenance costs of $1.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Transportation expenses
were favorably impacted by 1.6 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2014.

Transportation
expenses decreased by $1.4 million on a constant dollar basis during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 as
a result of a decrease in vehicle lease expense, primarily associated with our United Kingdom operations, due to the capitalization of leased vehicles upon renewal. Although the aggregate lease cost
has not changed, the categorization of charges did change, resulting in the cost being allocated to depreciation and interest. Transportation expenses were favorably impacted by 1.2 percentage
points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2013.

Product Cost of Sales and Other

Product cost of sales and other, which includes cartons, media and other service, storage and supply costs, is highly correlated to
service revenue streams, particularly project revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2014, product cost of sales and other decreased by $2.1 million compared to the year ended
December 31, 2013 on an actual basis, primarily due to a reduction in costs associated with



special
projects. These costs were favorably impacted by 1.8 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2014.

For
the year ended December 31, 2013, product cost of sales and other increased by $9.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 on an actual basis,
primarily as a result of higher move costs associated with facility consolidations, as well as $1.5 million of incremental costs incurred
associated with 2013 acquisitions. These costs were favorably impacted by 1.0 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2013.

the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily driven by a $60.6 million decrease in REIT Costs and a $15.3 million decrease in
restructuring costs. These decreases were partially offset by increased compensation costs of $15.1 million, primarily associated with merit increases, higher incentive compensation and the
associated payroll taxes, as well as $7.2 million of incremental general and administrative expenses associated with international acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2014 and the fourth quarter
of 2013. General and administrative expenses were favorably impacted by 0.8 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2014.

compensation expenses of $2.9 million related to the mix of project work year over year performed by internal personnel associated with capital versus maintenance initiatives. Information technology
expenses were favorably impacted by 0.7 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2014.

expense increased $9.4 million and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, compared to the years ended

As
a result of our conversion to a REIT and in accordance with SEC rules applicable to REITs, we no longer report (gain) loss on sale of real estate as a component of operating income,
but we will continue to report it as a component of income (loss) from continuing operations. We will continue to report the (gain) loss on sale of property, plant and equipment (excluding real

foreign currency transaction losses of $58.3 million, based on period-end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2014. Losses resulted primarily
from changes in the exchange rate of each of the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Euro, Russian ruble and Ukrainian hryvnia against the United States dollar compared to
December 31, 2013, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our Latin American and European subsidiaries, as well as Euro forward contracts. These losses were
partially offset by gains primarily from British pound sterling borrowings on our revolving credit facility, Australian dollar and British pound sterling forward contracts, and Euro denominated bonds
issued by IMI.

United Kingdom in a stock transaction and recorded a pretax gain of approximately $6.9 million (see Note 16 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report).
Also included in other, net in the year ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $0.9 million of royalty income and $1.1 million of gains associated with a deferred compensation
plan we sponsor. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2013 consists primarily of $3.7 million of royalty income. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2012 consists
primarily of $2.7 million of royalty income, $1.5 million of gains associated with our acquisition of equity interests that we previously held associated with our Turkish and Swiss joint
ventures and $1.3 million of gains associated with a deferred compensation plan we sponsor.



Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 were 38.5%, 38.9% and (43.5)%, respectively. The
primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 were differences in the rates of tax at which our
foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates and state income taxes (net of federal tax benefit). During the year ended
December 31, 2012, foreign currency gains were recorded in lower tax jurisdictions associated with our marking-to-market of intercompany loan positions while foreign currency losses were
recorded in higher tax jurisdictions associated with our marking-to-market of debt and derivative instruments, which lowered our 2012 effective tax rate by 2.2%. The primary reconciling items between
the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 were the impact from the repatriation discussed below, which increased our 2013
effective tax rate by 13.1%, and state income taxes (net of federal tax benefit). These expenses were partially offset by a favorable impact provided by the recognition of certain previously
unrecognized tax benefits due to expirations of statute of limitation periods and settlements with tax authorities in various jurisdictions and differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign
earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates.

During
2013, we completed a plan to utilize both current and carryforward foreign tax credits by repatriating approximately $252.7 million (approximately $65.2 million of
which was previously subject to United States taxes) from our foreign earnings. Due to uncertainty in our ability to fully utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards, we previously did not recognize a
full benefit for such foreign tax credit carryforwards in our tax provision. As a result, we recorded an increase in our tax provision from continuing operations in the amount of $63.5 million
in 2013. This increase was offset by decreases of $18.8 million from current year foreign tax credits and $23.3 million reversal of valuation allowances related to foreign tax credit
carryforwards, resulting in a net increase of $21.5 million in our tax provision from continuing operations.

As
a result of our REIT conversion, we recorded a net tax benefit of $212.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 for the revaluation of certain deferred tax
assets and liabilities associated with the REIT conversion. In 2014, we recorded an increase to the tax provision of $29.3 million associated with tax accounting method changes consistent with
our REIT conversion, primarily affected through the filing of amended tax returns. The primary other reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate
during the year ended December 31, 2014 was an increase of $46.4 million in our tax provision from the repatriation discussed below and other net tax adjustments related to the REIT
conversion, including a tax benefit of $63.3 million primarily related to the dividends paid deduction. As a REIT, we are entitled to a deduction for dividends paid, resulting in a substantial
reduction of federal income tax expense. As a REIT, substantially all of our income tax expense will be incurred based on the earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic TRSs.

We
had not previously provided incremental federal and certain state income taxes on net tax over book outside basis differences related to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries
because our intent, prior to our conversion to a REIT, was to reinvest our current and future undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the United States. As a result
of our conversion to a REIT, it is no longer our intent to indefinitely reinvest our current and future undistributed foreign earnings outside the United States, and, therefore, during 2014, we
recognized an increase in our tax provision from continuing operations in the amount of $46.4 million, representing incremental federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on
such foreign earnings. As a REIT, future repatriation of incremental undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will not be subject to federal or state income tax, with the exception of
foreign withholding taxes in limited instances;



however,
such future repatriations will require distribution in accordance with REIT distribution rules, and any such distribution may then be taxable, as appropriate, at the stockholder level.

Our
effective tax rate is subject to variability in the future due to, among other items: (1) changes in the mix of income between our qualified REIT subsidiaries and our TRSs;
(2) tax law changes; (3) volatility
in foreign exchange gains (losses); (4) the timing of the establishment and reversal of tax reserves; and (5) our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and net operating losses that we
generate. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have business
operations or a taxable presence. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. Although we believe our tax estimates
are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates.

Gain on Sale of Real Estate, Net of Tax

Consolidated gain on sale of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $8.3 million, net of tax of
$2.2 million associated with the sale of two buildings in the United Kingdom and a building in Canada. Consolidated gain on sale of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2013 was
$1.4 million, net of tax of $0.4 million associated with the sale of a building in the United Kingdom. Consolidated gain on sale of real estate for the year ended December 31,
2012 was $0.2 million, net of tax of $0.1 million associated with the sale of a building in the United Kingdom.

INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014
increased $229.8 million, or 231.7%, to $329.0 million (10.6% of consolidated revenues) from income from continuing operations of $99.2 million (3.3% of consolidated revenues) for
the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in income from continuing operations is primarily due to a $159.4 million decrease in our provision for income taxes as a result of our
REIT conversion and a $60.6 million decrease in REIT Costs in 2014 compared to 2013.

As
a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased $83.5 million, or 45.7%, to
$99.2 million (3.3% of consolidated revenues) from income from continuing operations of $182.7 million (6.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2012. The
decrease in income from continuing operations is primarily due to a $48.4 million increase in REIT Costs year over year, restructuring costs of $23.4 million and a $59.1 million
increase in other expenses primarily associated with debt extinguishment costs and foreign exchange losses, partially offset by a lower income tax provision in 2013 compared to 2012.

INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS,
NET OF TAX

Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily related to
legal reserves, offset by the recovery of insurance proceeds in excess of carrying value. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2013, which primarily represents the recovery of insurance proceeds in excess of carrying value. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax was $6.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2012, primarily due to losses related to our Italian operations which we sold on April 27, 2012.

We
recorded a loss on sale of discontinued operations in the amount of $1.9 million ($1.9 million, net of tax) during the year ended December 31, 2012 as a result of
the sale of our Italian operations.



NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in a decrease in net income attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated of
$2.6 million, $3.5 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These amounts represent our noncontrolling partners' share
of earnings/losses in our majority-owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results.

Segment Analysis (in thousands)

As a result of certain organizational realignments effective January 1, 2014, we evaluated changes to our internal financial
reporting to better align our internal reporting to how
we will manage our business going forward. This evaluation resulted in changes to our reportable segments effective January 1, 2014. As a result of the changes to our reportable segments, the
former North American Business segment was separated into two unique reportable segments, which we refer to as (1) North American Records and Information Management Business segment and
(2) North American Data Management Business segment. In addition, the Emerging Businesses segment, which was previously reported as a component of the former North American Business segment, is
now reported as a component of the Corporate and Other segment. As a result, we have restated previously reported segment information.

Our
reportable operating segments are North American Records and Information Management Business, North American Data Management Business, International Business and Corporate and Other.
See Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. Our North American Records and Information Management Business segment offers storage and information
management services throughout the United States and Canada, including Records Management; Destruction; DMS; Fulfillment Services; and Intellectual Property Management. Our North American Data
Management Business segment offers storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans throughout the United States and Canada, including Data
Protection & Recovery, server and computer backup services, digital content repository systems to house, distribute, and archive key media assets, and storage, safeguarding and electronic or
physical delivery of physical media of all types, primarily for entertainment and media industry clients. Our International Business segment offers storage and information management services
throughout Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, including Records Management, Data Protection & Recovery and DMS. Our European operations provide Records Management, Data Protection &
Recovery and DMS throughout Europe. Our Latin America operations provide Records Management, Data Protection & Recovery and DMS throughout Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.
Our Asia Pacific operations provide Records Management, Data Protection & Recovery and DMS throughout Australia, with Records Management and Data Protection & Recovery also provided in
certain cities in India, Singapore, Hong Kong-SAR and China. Prior to December 2014, our International Business segment offered Destruction in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia. See
Note 16 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further disclosure related to the divestiture of these secure shredding operations in December 2014.
Corporate and Other consists of our data center business in the United States, the primary product offering of our Emerging Businesses segment, as well as costs related to executive and staff
functions, including finance, human resources and information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. These costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a
corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. Our
Corporate and Other segment also includes stock-based employee compensation expense associated with all stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and shares of stock
issued under our employee stock purchase plan.

See
Note 9 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for the definition of Adjusted OIBDA and for the basis on
which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to income (loss) from continuing operations before provision (benefit) for income taxes and (gain) loss on sale of real estate.

During
the year ended December 31, 2014, reported revenue in our North American Records and Information Management Business segment increased 1.5% compared to the year ended
December 31, 2013. This increase is primarily attributable to the impact of acquisitions of 2.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
Flat total internal growth was primarily the result of negative service internal growth of 0.5%, resulting from a trend toward reduced retrieval/re-file activity and a related decrease in
transportation revenues, partially offset by storage rental revenue internal growth of 0.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily related to net price increases. For the year ended
December 31, 2014, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported revenues for the North American Records and Information Management Business segment by 0.8% compared to the
year ended December 31, 2013 due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased 200 basis points in the
year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to decreases in restructuring charges and compensation expense as a result of the organizational restructuring initiated in the
fourth quarter of 2013.

During
the year ended December 31, 2013, reported revenue in our North American Records and Information Management Business segment decreased 0.6% compared to the year ended
December 31, 2012, primarily due to negative internal growth of 1.4%. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the negative internal growth was primarily driven by negative consolidated
service internal growth of 3.9%, which was the result of a trend toward reduced retrieval/re-file activity and a related decrease in transportation revenues, partially offset by storage rental revenue
internal growth of 0.4% in the year



ended
December 31, 2013 primarily related to net price increases. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue declined 90 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared
to the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to restructuring charges, partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense as a result of restructuring in sales, marketing and account
management during the fourth quarter of 2012.

During
the year ended December 31, 2014, reported revenue in our North American Data Management Business segment decreased 1.6% compared to the year ended December 31,
2013, primarily due to negative internal growth of 1.5%. The negative internal growth was primarily attributable to negative service internal growth of 7.5%, which was due to declines in service
revenue activity levels as the storage business becomes more archival in nature, partially offset by storage rental revenue internal growth of 2.3% in the year ended December 31, 2014,
primarily related to net price increases. For the year ended December 31, 2014, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our reported revenues for the North American Data
Management Business segment by 0.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of
segment revenue declined 180 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the aforementioned negative internal growth,
as well as costs not decreasing in proportion to the decline in revenue.



During
the year ended December 31, 2013, reported revenue in our North American Data Management Business segment decreased 1.9% compared to the year ended December 31,
2012, primarily due to negative internal growth of 2.0%. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the negative internal growth was primarily attributable to negative consolidated service internal
growth of 7.0%, which was due to declines in service revenue activity levels as the storage business becomes more archival in nature, partially offset by storage rental revenue internal growth of 1.5%
in the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily related to net price increases. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue declined 90 basis points in the year ended December 31,

which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to income (loss) from continuing operations before provision (benefit) for income taxes and (gain) loss on sale of real estate.

Reported
revenues in our International Business segment increased 8.6% during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Internal growth
for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 4.5%, supported by 6.3% storage rental internal growth. Net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 6.8% of the increase in total reported revenue growth
in the year ended December 31, 2014. Foreign currency fluctuations in 2014 resulted in decreased revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014, as measured in United States dollars, of
approximately 2.7% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily due to the weakening of the Australian dollar and Brazilian real against the United States dollar, partially offset
by a strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Euro against the United States dollar. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage



of
segment revenue decreased on a portfolio basis in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to the impact associated with a fire at
one of our facilities in Buenos Aires, Argentina on February 5, 2014 (described at Note 10.g. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report), as well as
integration costs associated with recent international acquisitions.

Reported
revenues in our International Business segment increased 4.8% during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Internal growth
for the year ended December 31, 2013 was 3.2%, supported by 6.2% storage rental internal growth, partially offset by negative total service internal growth of 0.5% as a result of lower
shredding revenues. Acquisitions contributed 3.6% to total reported revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2013. Foreign currency fluctuations in 2013, primarily in Europe, resulted in
decreased revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013, as measured in United States dollars, of approximately 2.0% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Adjusted OIBDA as a
percentage of segment revenue increased in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to increased operating income from productivity
gains, pricing actions and disciplined cost management.

See
Note 9 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for the definition of Adjusted OIBDA and for the basis on
which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to income (loss) from continuing operations before provision (benefit) for income taxes and (gain) loss on sale of real estate.

During
the year ended December 31, 2014, Adjusted OIBDA in the Corporate and Other segment as a percentage of consolidated revenue decreased by 20 basis points compared to the
year ended



December 31,
2013, primarily due to increased insurance costs of $3.5 million associated with a fire at one of our facilities in Buenos Aires, Argentina on February 5, 2014
(described at Note 10.g. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report), higher professional fees of $2.6 million, restructuring costs of
$1.5 million and REIT compliance costs.

During
the year ended December 31, 2013, Adjusted OIBDA in the Corporate and Other segment as a percentage of consolidated revenue decreased by 70 basis points compared to the
year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to an $11.7 million increase in compensation costs, primarily associated with employee compensation and restructuring costs, an
$8.7 million increase in professional fees and legal reserves, and the costs associated with the decision to discontinue work on a data archiving solution recorded in 2013.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $472.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $506.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2013. The 6.6% year-over-year decrease resulted primarily from an increase in cash used in working capital of $74.7 million primarily related to the timing and
payments of certain accrued expenses and deferred revenue liabilities, offset by an increase in net income, including non-cash charges and realized foreign exchange losses, of $41.1 million.

Our
business requires capital expenditures to support our expected revenue growth and ongoing operations as well as new products and services and increased profitability. These
expenditures are included in the cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations. The nature of our capital expenditures has evolved over time along with the nature of our business. We
make capital expenditures to support a number of different objectives. The majority of our capital goes to support business-line growth and our ongoing operations, but we also expend capital to
support the
development and improvement of products and services and projects designed to increase our profitability. These expenditures are generally small and discretionary in nature. Cash paid for our capital
expenditures, cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired) and additions to customer acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2014 amounted to $361.9 million,
$128.1 million and $34.4 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, these expenditures were funded with cash flows provided by operating activities from
continuing operations, cash equivalents on hand, borrowings under the Credit Agreement, proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and the divestiture of our International Shredding
Operations. Excluding potential future acquisitions and additional real estate purchases above our plan, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $330.0 million to
$360.0 million in the year ending December 31, 2015 (inclusive of approximately $25.0 million in planned real estate purchases).



Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. During 2014, we
received $642.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the GBP Notes, net receipts of $460.5 million of other debt (primarily associated with our Credit Agreement, defined below)
and $44.3 million from proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan. We used the proceeds from these transactions for the retirement of $247.3 million
of the 7


/


% Notes, the early redemption of $306.0 million of our 8


/


% Notes for approximately $319.1 million (inclusive of call premium payment), for
payment of dividends in the amount of $542.3 million on our common stock and net payments of $14.8 million associated with our noncontrolling interest holders.

Dividends

See "Item 5. Market For Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" of
this Annual Report for information on dividends.

Financial Instruments and Debt

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money
market funds and time deposits), restricted cash (primarily United States Treasuries) and accounts receivable. The only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of December 31, 2014
relate to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash held on deposit with three global banks and two "Triple A" rated money market funds, all of which we consider to be large, highly-rated
investment-grade institutions. As per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund to a maximum of
$50.0 million or in any one financial institution to a maximum of $75.0 million. As of December 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was
$159.8 million, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $53.0 million. The money market funds are invested substantially in United States Treasuries.

The
capital stock or other equity interests of most of our United States subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our
first-tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure these debt instruments, together with all intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) of subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our
United States subsidiary guarantors. In addition, Canada Company has pledged 66% of the capital stock of its subsidiaries, and all intercompany



obligations
(including promissory notes) owed to or held by it, to secure the Canadian dollar subfacility under the Revolving Credit Facility.

(2)

Collectively,
the "Parent Notes." IMI is the direct obligor on the Parent Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior or senior
subordinated basis, as the case may be, by substantially all of its direct and indirect 100% owned United States subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of
the Guarantors. Canada Company, IME and the remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Parent Notes.

(3)

Canada
Company is the direct obligor on the CAD Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior basis, by IMI and the Guarantors. These
guarantees are joint and several obligations of IMI and the Guarantors. See Note 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.

(4)

IME
is the direct obligor on the GBP Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior basis, by IMI and the Guarantors. These guarantees
are joint and several obligations of IMI and the Guarantors. See Note 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.

(5)

Includes
(a) real estate mortgages of $5.1 million, (b) capital lease obligations of $241.9 million, and (c) other
various notes and other obligations, which were assumed by us as a result of certain acquisitions, of $73.7 million.

On
August 7, 2013, we amended our existing credit agreement. The revolving credit facilities (the "Revolving Credit Facility") under our credit agreement, as amended (the "Credit
Agreement"), allow IMI and certain of its United States and foreign subsidiaries to borrow in United States dollars and (subject to sublimits) a variety of other currencies (including Canadian
dollars, British pounds sterling, Euros, Brazilian reais and Australian dollars, among other currencies) in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed $1.5 billion. Additionally, the Credit
Agreement included an option to allow us to request additional commitments of up to $500.0 million, in the form of term loans or through increased commitments under the Revolving Credit
Facility. On September 24, 2014, we borrowed an additional
$250.0 million in the form of a term loan under the Credit Agreement (the "Term Loan"). Commencing on December 31, 2014, the Term Loan will begin amortizing in quarterly installments in
an amount equal to $0.6 million per quarter, with the remaining balance due on June 27, 2016. The Term Loan may be prepaid without penalty or premium, in whole or in part, at any time.
The Credit Agreement continues to include an option to allow us to request additional commitments of up to $250.0 million, in the form of term loans or through increased commitments under the
Revolving Credit Facility.

The
Credit Agreement terminates on June 27, 2016, at which point all obligations become due. IMI and the Guarantors guarantee all obligations under the Credit Agreement, and have
pledged the capital stock or other equity interests of most of their United States subsidiaries, up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of their first-tier foreign subsidiaries, and
all intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) owed to or held by them to secure the Credit Agreement. In addition, Canada Company has pledged 66% of the capital stock of its subsidiaries,
and all intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) owed to or held by it to secure the Canadian dollar subfacility under the Revolving Credit Facility. The interest rate on borrowings under
the Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin, which varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio. Additionally, the Credit
Agreement requires the payment of a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, which fee ranges from between 0.3% to 0.5% based on certain financial ratios and fees
associated with outstanding letters of credit. As of December 31, 2014, we had $883.4 million and $249.4 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and
the Term Loan, respectively. Of the $883.4 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, $680.2 million was



denominated
in United States dollars, 77.2 million was denominated in Canadian dollars, 64.3 million was denominated in Euros and 71.6 million was denominated in Australian
dollars. In addition, we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $10.4 million. The remaining amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility as of
December 31, 2014, based on IMI's leverage ratio, the last 12 months' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and rent expense ("EBITDAR"), other adjustments as
defined in the Credit Agreement and current external debt, was $606.2 million (which amount represents the maximum availability as of such date). The average interest rate in effect under the
Credit Agreement was 2.7% as of December 31, 2014. The average interest rate in effect under the Revolving Credit Facility was 2.8% and ranged from 2.3% to 5.1% as of December 31, 2014
and the interest rate in effect under the Term Loan as of December 31, 2014 was 2.4%. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, we recorded commitment fees and letters of
credit fees of $2.3 million, $3.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively, based on the unused balances under our revolving credit facilities and outstanding letters of credit. We
recorded a charge of $5.5 million to other expense (income), net in the third quarter of 2013 related to an amendment of our revolving credit and term loan facilities, representing a write-off
of deferred financing costs.

The
Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our
ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take
certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the Credit Agreement, our indentures or other
agreements governing our indebtedness. The Credit Agreement uses EBITDAR-based calculations as the primary measures of financial performance, including leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. IMI's
Credit Agreement net total lease adjusted leverage ratio was 5.0 and 5.4 as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5, and its net secured debt
lease adjusted leverage ratio was 2.2 and 2.6 as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 4.0. IMI's bond leverage ratio (which is not lease
adjusted), per the indentures, was 5.1 and 5.7 as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5. IMI's Credit Agreement fixed charge coverage ratio
was 2.5 at both December 31, 2013 and 2014 compared to a minimum allowable ratio of 1.5 under the Credit Agreement. Noncompliance with these leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios would have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.

In
August 2013, IMI completed an underwritten public offering of $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6% Notes, and Canada Company completed an underwritten public
offering of 200.0 million CAD in aggregate principal amount of CAD Notes, both of which were issued at 100% of par. The net proceeds to IMI and Canada Company of $782.3 million, after
paying the underwriters' discounts and commissions, were used to redeem (1) all of the outstanding 7


/


% Notes, (2) all of the outstanding 8% Notes due 2018,
(3) all of the outstanding 8% Notes due 2020, and (4) $137.5 million in principal amount of the 8


/


% Notes. The remaining net proceeds were used to repay
indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility. We recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $38.1 million in the third quarter of 2013 related to the early extinguishment of this
debt. This charge consists of call and tender premiums, original issue discounts and deferred financing costs related to this debt.

In
January 2014, we redeemed the 150.0 million British pounds sterling (approximately $248.0 million) in aggregate principal amount of the 7


/


% Notes at
100% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, utilizing borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and cash on-hand.

In
September 2014, IME completed a private offering of 400.0 million British pounds sterling in aggregate principal amount of the GBP Notes, which were issued at 100% of par. The
net proceeds to IME of 394.0 million British pounds sterling (approximately $642.0 million based on an exchange rate



of
1.63), after paying the initial purchasers' commissions and expenses, were used to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes.

In
December 2014, we redeemed $306.0 million aggregate principal outstanding of our 8


/


% Notes at 104.188% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, utilizing
borrowings under our Revolving Credit
Facility. We recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $16.5 million related to the early extinguishment of this debt in the fourth quarter of 2014 representing the call premium
associated with the early redemption, as well as a write-off of original issue discounts and deferred financing costs related to this debt.

Our
ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic,
financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that
future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to make necessary capital expenditures.

Acquisitions

In January 2014, in order to enhance our existing operations in Australia, we acquired the stock of Tape Management Services
Pty Ltd, a storage and data management company with operations in Australia, for approximately $15.3 million.

In
February 2014, in order to enhance our existing operations in Turkey, we acquired the stock of RM Arşiv Yönetim Hizmetleri Ticaret Anonim

Poland, for approximately $13.7 million.

In
September 2014, we purchased our joint venture partners' noncontrolling interests in the businesses we operate in Russia, Ukraine and Denmark, which we had previously consolidated.
The purchase price of approximately $24.5 million is comprised of $17.9 million paid at closing, $2.1 million payable in 2017 and $4.5 million payable in 2020. Of the
$17.9 million paid at closing, approximately $12.0 million was associated with the underlying shares owned by our joint venture partners and approximately $6.0 million was
associated with the payment of outstanding loans between the joint venture and the joint venture partners.

In
October 2014, in order to enhance our existing operations in Brazil, we acquired the stock of Keepers Brasil Ltda, a storage rental and data management business in Sao Paulo,
Brazil, for
approximately $46.2 million. The purchase price includes $5.4 million held in escrow to secure indemnification obligations of the former owners of the business to us.

In
December 2014, in order to enhance our North American records management operations, we acquired the stock of Canadian-based Securit Records Management for approximately
$29.5 million. Included in the purchase price is approximately $1.3 million held in escrow to secure indemnification obligations and certain working capital adjustments.

Divestitures

In December 2014, we divested our International Shredding Operations in a stock transaction for approximately $26.2 million in
cash at closing, including $1.5 million being held in escrow. The assets sold primarily consisted of customer contracts and certain long-lived assets.

(1)

Amounts
include variable rate interest payments, which are calculated utilizing the applicable interest rates as of December 31, 2014; see
Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. Amounts also include interest on capital leases.

(2)

Amounts
are offset by sublease income of $16.7 million in total (including $5.7 million, $7.9 million, $2.1 million and
$1.0 million, in less than 1 year, 1-3 years, 3-5 years and more than 5 years, respectively).

(3)

The
table above excludes $56.0 million in uncertain tax positions as we are unable to make reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if
any, with the respective taxing authorities.

We
expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and
other financings, which may include senior or senior subordinated notes, secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings, and the issuance of equity. We expect to
meet our long-term cash flow requirements using the same means described above. We are highly leveraged. While we expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future, as a REIT we
expect our long-term capital allocation strategy will naturally shift toward increased use of equity to support lower leverage, though our leverage has increased, in the short-term, to fund the costs
of the Conversion Plan.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4)(ii).

Net Operating Losses

We have federal net operating loss carryforwards, which expire in 2021 through 2033, of $88.1 million ($0, tax effected) at
December 31, 2014 to reduce future federal taxable income, on which no federal tax benefit is expected to be realized. We have state net operating loss carryforwards, which expire in 2015
through 2033, of $74.4 million ($0.1 million, tax effected) at December 31, 2014 to reduce future state taxable income, on which an insignificant state tax benefit is expected to
be realized. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $64.6 million, with various expiration dates (and in some cases no expiration date), subject to a valuation allowance of
approximately 62%.



Inflation

Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to
normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies, the negotiation of favorable long-term real estate
leases and customer contracts which contain provisions for inflationary price escalators, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar
efficiencies, leases or increased storage rental or service charges.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money
market funds and time deposits), restricted cash (primarily United States Treasuries) and accounts receivable. The only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of December 31, 2014
relate to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash held on deposit with three global banks and two "Triple A" rated money market funds, all of which we consider to be large, highly-rated
investment-grade institutions. As per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund to a maximum of
$50.0 million or in any one financial institution to a maximum of $75.0 million. As of December 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was
$159.8 million, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $53.0 million. The money market funds are invested substantially in United States Treasuries.

Interest Rate Risk

Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long-term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use
long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business at attractive rates, thereby helping to preserve our long-term returns on invested capital. We target approximately 75% of our debt
portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. See Notes 3 and 4 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.

As
of December 31, 2014, we had $1,134.6 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of approximately 2.7%, and
$3,528.9 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 76% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our
variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2014 would have been reduced by approximately $3.7 million. See Note 4 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2014.

Currency Risk

Our investments in IME, Canada Company, Iron Mountain Mexico, SA de RL de CV, Iron Mountain South America, Ltd., Iron
Mountain Australia Pty Ltd., Iron Mountain CIS and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting
currency is the United States dollar. However, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the British pound sterling, Euro,
Canadian dollar, Brazilian real, Australian dollar and the Russian ruble. Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the United States dollar will cause revenues in
United States dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency.



The
impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. We
also have several
intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and IMI and our United States-based subsidiaries. In addition, our treasury centers in Switzerland, our foreign subsidiaries and IME also have
intercompany obligations between them. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary.

We
have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. One strategy is to finance certain of our international
subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. In determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax considerations, among
other factors. Another strategy we utilize is for IMI or Iron Mountain Information Management, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IMI, to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany
financing activities. In addition, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition, to lock in certain transaction
economics. We have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the United Kingdom, Canada and Continental Europe. IME has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in
British pounds sterling under the GBP Notes. Similarly, Canada Company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in Canadian dollars under the Credit Agreement and the CAD Notes. This
creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. Specifically, through our 255.0 million 6


/


% Notes, we effectively hedge our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in Euros.
We designated a portion of our 6


/


% Notes issued by IMI as a hedge of net investment of certain of our Euro denominated subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded $6.4 million
($6.3 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange gains related to the "marking-to-market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive
items, net included in stockholders' equity for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, cumulative net gains of $13.8 million, net of tax are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge.

We
have also entered into a number of separate forward contracts to hedge our exposures in Euros, British pounds sterling and Australian dollars. As of December 31, 2014, we had
outstanding forward contracts to purchase 206.0 million Euros and sell $252.7 million United States dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with our European operations. At the
maturity of the forward contracts, we may enter into new forward contracts to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement
amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statements of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. At the end of each
month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation. We have not designated forward contracts as hedges.
During the year ended December 31, 2014, there was $21.1 million in net cash payments included in cash from operating activities from continuing operations related to settlements
associated with foreign currency forward contracts. We recorded net losses in connection with forward contracts of $18.0 million, including an unrealized foreign exchange loss of
$2.4 million related to the Euro forward contracts in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014,
except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are not hedged.

The
impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses.
Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect
of a change in foreign
exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items, net" component of equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2014



functional
currencies, relative to the United States dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $70.4 million.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The information required by this item is included in Item 15(a) of this Annual Report.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial  Disclosure.

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The term "disclosure controls and procedures" is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. These rules refer
to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information is recorded, processed, summarized and communicated to management, including its principal executive and
principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding what is required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act. As of
December 31, 2014 (the "Evaluation Date"), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the
Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to
provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Due to their inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which is included in this Annual Report.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Iron Mountain Incorporated

Boston, Massachusetts

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Iron Mountain Incorporated and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework
(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial
statement schedule.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Iron Mountain Incorporated

Boston, Massachusetts

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Iron Mountain Incorporated and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Iron Mountain Incorporated and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting

IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2014

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

1. Nature of Business

The accompanying financial statements represent the consolidated accounts of Iron Mountain Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("IMI") and its subsidiaries ("we" or "us"). We store
records, primarily paper documents and data backup media, and provide information management services in various locations throughout North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. We have a
diversified customer base consisting of commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations.

We
previously disclosed that, as part of our plan to convert to a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes and elect REIT status effective January 1,
2014 (the "Conversion Plan"), we sought private letter rulings ("PLRs") from the United States Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") relating to numerous technical tax issues, including classification
of our steel racking structures as qualified real estate assets. We submitted the PLR requests in the third quarter of 2012, and on June 25, 2014, we announced that we received the favorable
PLRs from the IRS necessary for our
conversion to a REIT. After receipt of the PLRs, our board of directors unanimously approved our conversion to a REIT for our taxable year beginning January 1, 2014.

In
connection with the Conversion Plan, and, in particular, to impose ownership limitations customary for REITs, on January 20, 2015, we completed the merger with our predecessor
and all outstanding shares of our predecessor's common stock were converted into a right to receive an equal number of shares of our common stock. Accordingly, references herein to our "common stock"
refer to our common stock and the common stock of our predecessor, as applicable.

On
June 2, 2011, we sold (the "Digital Sale") our online backup and recovery, digital archiving and eDiscovery solutions businesses of our digital business (the "Digital
Business") to Autonomy Corporation plc, a corporation formed under the laws of England and Wales ("Autonomy"), pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement dated as of May 15, 2011 among
IMI, certain subsidiaries of IMI and Autonomy (the "Digital Sale Agreement"). Additionally, on October 3, 2011, we sold our records management operations in New Zealand. Also, on
April 27, 2012, we sold our records management operations in Italy. The financial position, operating results and cash flows of the Digital Business, our New Zealand operations and our Italian
operations, including the gain on the sale of the Digital Business and our New Zealand operations and the loss on the sale of our Italian operations, for all periods presented, have been reported as
discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. See Note 14 for a further discussion of these events.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

a.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
accompanying financial statements reflect our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows on a consolidated basis. All intercompany
transactions and account balances have been eliminated.

b.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires us to make estimates, judgments and
assumptions



IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2014

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period
then ended. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates used. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe
to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.

c.

Cash,
Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on hand and cash invested in highly liquid short-term securities, which have remaining maturities at the date of purchase of less than
90 days. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

We
have restricted cash associated with a collateral trust agreement with our insurance carrier related to our workers' compensation self-insurance program. The restricted cash subject
to this agreement was $33,860 as of both December 31, 2013 and 2014, and is included in current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restricted cash consists primarily of United States
Treasuries.

d.

Foreign
Currency

Local
currencies are the functional currencies for our operations outside the United States, with the exception of certain foreign holding companies and our financing centers in

Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

Every
derivative instrument is required to be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value. Periodically, we acquire derivative instruments
that are intended to hedge either cash flows or values that are subject to foreign exchange or other market price risk and not for trading purposes. We have formally documented our hedging
relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management

objectives
and strategies for undertaking each hedge transaction. Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long-term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use
long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby preserving our long-term returns on invested capital. We target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to
interest rates. Occasionally, we may use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. In addition, we may use borrowings in foreign currencies, either obtained in
the United States or by our foreign subsidiaries, to hedge foreign currency risk associated with our international investments. Sometimes we enter into currency swaps to temporarily hedge an overseas
investment, such as a major acquisition, while we arrange permanent financing or to hedge our exposure due to foreign currency
exchange movements related to our intercompany accounts with and between our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2013 and 2014, none of our derivative instruments contained credit-risk
related contingent features.

Minor
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Major improvements which extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or the efficiency of property owned are
capitalized. Major improvements to leased buildings are capitalized as leasehold improvements and depreciated.

We
develop various software applications for internal use. Computer software costs associated with internal use software are expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria
are met. Payroll and related costs for employees directly associated with, and devoting time to, the development of internal use computer software projects (to the extent time is spent directly on the
project) are capitalized. During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, we capitalized $26,755, $39,487 and $19,419 of costs, respectively, associated with the development of
internal use computer software projects. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the
function intended. Capitalization ends when the asset is ready for its intended use. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are
periodically evaluated for impairment.

We
wrote off previously deferred software costs associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued after implementation, which resulted in a loss on
disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, by segment as follows:

Entities
are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. Asset retirement obligations represent the costs
to replace or remove tangible long-lived assets required by law, regulatory rule or contractual agreement. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the
carrying amount of the related long-lived asset, which is then depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The liability is increased over time through accretion expense (included in
depreciation expense) such that the liability will equate to the future cost to retire the long-lived asset at the expected retirement date. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles
the obligation for its recorded amount or realizes a gain or loss upon settlement. Our obligations are primarily the result of requirements under our facility lease agreements which generally have
"return to original condition" clauses which would require us to remove or restore items such as shred pits, vaults, demising walls and office build-outs, among others. The significant assumptions
used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are the timing of removals, the probability of a requirement to perform, estimated cost and associated expected
inflation rates that are consistent with historical rates and credit-adjusted risk-free rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate.

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Other than goodwill, we
currently have no intangible assets that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives are amortized over their useful
lives. We annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances warrant, assess whether a change in the lives over which our intangible assets are amortized is necessary.

We
have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2012, 2013 and 2014 and
concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of those dates. As of December 31, 2014, no factors were identified that would alter our October 1, 2014 goodwill assessment. In making this
assessment, we relied on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to
these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the
reporting units affected based on their relative fair values.

Our
reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2013 were as follows: (1) North America; (2) United Kingdom,
Ireland, Norway, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain ("Western Europe"); (3) the remaining countries in Europe in which we operate, excluding Russia and Ukraine
("Emerging Markets"); (4) Latin America; (5) Australia, China, Hong Kong and Singapore ("Asia Pacific"); and (6) India, Russia and Ukraine

Beginning
January 1, 2014, as a result of the changes in our reportable segments associated with our reorganization (see Note 9 for a description of our reportable
operating segments), we now have 12
reporting units. Our North American Records and Information Management Business segment includes the following three reporting units: (1) North American Records and Information Management;
(2) Intellectual Property Management; and (3) Fulfillment Services. The North American Data Management Business segment is a separate reporting unit. The Emerging Businesses reporting
unit (which primarily relates to our data center business in the United States and which is a component of Corporate and Other) is also a reporting unit. Additionally, the International Business
segment consists of the following seven reporting units: (1) United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland ("New Western
Europe"); (2) the remaining countries in Europe in which we operate, excluding Russia, Ukraine and Denmark ("New Emerging Markets"); (3) Latin America; (4) Australia and
Singapore; (5) China and Hong Kong ("Greater China"); (6) India; and (7) Russia, Ukraine and Denmark. We have reassigned goodwill associated with the reporting units impacted by
the reorganization among the new reporting units on a relative fair value basis. The fair value of each of our new reporting units was determined based on the application of a combined weighted
average approach of fair value multiples of revenue and earnings and discounted cash flow techniques.

As
a result of the change in the composition of our reporting units noted above, we concluded that we had an interim triggering event, and, therefore, we performed an interim goodwill
impairment test as of January 1, 2014 on the basis of these new reporting units during the first quarter of 2014. We

unit valuations have been determined using a combined approach based on the present value of future cash flows and market multiples of revenues and earnings. The income
approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting
these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. In conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment reviews, we reconcile the sum of the valuations of all of our reporting
units to our market capitalization as of such dates.

Long-Lived
Assets

We
review long-lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations
are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, the
long-lived assets are written down, on a pro rata basis, to fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets.

As
a result of our conversion to a REIT and in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules applicable to REITs, we no longer report (gain) loss on sale of real
estate as a component of operating income, but we will continue to report it as a component of income (loss) from continuing operations. We will continue to report the (gain) loss on sale of property,
plant and equipment (excluding real estate), along with any impairment, write-downs or involuntary conversions related to real estate, as a component of operating income. Previously reported amounts
have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.

Consolidated
loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net was $4,661 for the year ended December 31, 2012 and consisted primarily of
approximately $5,800, $700, $1,100 and $500 of asset write-offs in Europe, North American Records and Information Management Business, Emerging Businesses and Latin America, respectively, partially
offset by approximately $3,500 of gains associated with the retirement of leased vehicles accounted for as capital lease assets associated with our North American Records and Information Management
Business segment. Consolidated loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net was $430 for the year ended December 31, 2013 and consisted of $1,700 of
asset write-offs in our North American Records and Information Management Business segment, approximately $300 of asset write-offs in our Corporate and Other segment and approximately $900 of asset
write-offs associated with our European operations, offset by gains of approximately $2,500 on the retirement of leased vehicles accounted for as capital lease assets primarily associated with our
North American Records and Information Management Business segment. Consolidated loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net was $1,065 for the year ended
December 31,
2014 and consisted primarily of losses associated with the write-off of certain software associated with our North American Records and Information Management Business segment.

Gain
on sale of real estate, net of tax, which consists primarily of the sale of buildings in the United Kingdom, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 is as

Customer
Relationships and Acquisition Costs and Other Intangible Assets

Costs
related to the acquisition of large volume accounts are capitalized. Initial costs incurred to transport boxes to one of our facilities, which include labor and transportation
charges, are amortized over periods ranging from one to 30 years (weighted average of 25 years at December 31, 2014), and are included in depreciation and amortization in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Payments to a customer's current records management vendor or direct payments to a customer are amortized over periods ranging from one to
15 years (weighted average of six years at December 31, 2014) to the storage and service revenue line items in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. If the customer
terminates its relationship with us, the unamortized cost is charged to expense or revenue. However, in the event of such termination, we generally collect, and record as income, permanent removal
fees that generally equal or exceed the amount of the unamortized costs. Customer relationship intangible assets acquired through business combinations, which represents the majority of the balance,
are amortized over periods ranging from 10 to 30 years (weighted average of
20 years at December 31, 2014). Amounts allocated in purchase accounting to customer relationship intangible assets are calculated based upon estimates of their fair value utilizing an
income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Other intangible assets, including noncompetition agreements, acquired core technology and trademarks, are capitalized and
amortized over periods ranging from five to 10 years (weighted average of six years at December 31, 2014).

Deferred
Financing Costs

Deferred
financing costs are amortized over the life of the related debt using the effective interest rate method. If debt is retired early, the related unamortized deferred financing
costs are written off in the period the debt is retired to other expense (income), net. As of December 31, 2013 and 2014, gross carrying amount of deferred financing costs was $62,418 and
$63,033, respectively, and accumulated amortization of those costs was $16,811 and $15,956, respectively, and was recorded in other assets, net in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Revenues

Our
revenues consist of storage rental revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes. Storage rental revenues, which are considered a key
driver of financial performance for the storage and information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic rental charges related to the storage of materials or data
(generally on a per unit basis). Service revenues include charges for related service activities, which include: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary
removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records and the destruction of records; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer
request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents and the related sale of recycled paper, the price of which can fluctuate from period to period; (4) other services, including the
scanning, imaging and document conversion services of active and inactive records, or Document Management Solutions ("DMS"), which relate to physical and digital records, and project revenues;
(5) customer termination and permanent withdrawal fees; (6) data restoration projects; (7) special project work; (8) the storage, assembly, and detailed reporting of
customer marketing literature and delivery to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' sites based on current and prospective customer orders ("Fulfillment Services");
(9) consulting services; and (10) technology escrow services that protect and manage source code ("Intellectual Property Management") and other technology services and product sales
(including specially designed storage containers and related supplies).

We
recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage rental and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage rental or service is provided, and customers
are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms. Amounts related to future storage rental or prepaid service contracts for customers where storage rental fees or services
are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the period the applicable storage rental or service is provided or performed. Revenues from the sales of
products, which are included as a component of service revenues, are recognized when products are shipped and title has passed to the customer. Revenues from the sales of products have historically
not been significant.

Rent
Normalization

We
have entered into various leases for buildings that expire over various terms. Certain leases have fixed escalation clauses (excluding those tied to the consumer price index or other
inflation-based indices) or other features (including return to original condition, primarily in the United Kingdom) which require normalization of the rental expense over the life of the lease,
resulting in deferred rent being reflected as a liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, we have assumed various above and below market leases in connection with certain
of our acquisitions. The difference between the present value of these lease obligations and the market rate at the date of the acquisition was recorded as a deferred rent liability or other long-term
asset and is being amortized to rent expense over the remaining lives of the respective leases.

n.

Stock-Based
Compensation

We
record stock-based compensation expense, utilizing the straight-line method, for the cost of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance units
("PUs") and shares of stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP") (together, "Employee Stock-Based Awards").

Stock-based
compensation expense for Employee Stock-Based Awards included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and
2014 was
$30,360 ($23,437 after tax or $0.14 per basic and $0.13 per diluted share), $30,354 ($22,085 after tax or $0.12 per basic and $0.11 per diluted share) and $29,624 ($21,886 after tax or $0.11 per basic
and diluted share), respectively.

The
benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost are required to be reported as financing activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements
of Cash Flows. This requirement reduces reported operating cash flows and increases reported financing cash flows. As a result, net financing cash flows from continuing operations included $1,045,
$2,389 and $(60) for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively, from the benefits (deficiency) of tax deductions compared to recognized compensation cost. The tax benefit
of any resulting excess tax deduction increases the Additional Paid-in Capital ("APIC") pool. Any resulting tax deficiency is deducted from the APIC pool.

Stock Options

Under our various stock option plans, options are generally granted with exercise prices equal to the market price of the stock on the
date of grant; however, in certain limited instances, options are granted at prices greater than the market price of the stock on the date of grant. The majority of our options become exercisable
ratably over a period of five years from the date of grant and generally have a contractual life of ten years from the date of grant, unless the holder's employment is terminated sooner. Certain of
the options we issue become exercisable ratably over a period of ten years from the date of grant and have a contractual life of 12 years from the date of grant, unless the holder's employment
is terminated sooner. As of December 31, 2014, ten-year vesting options represented 8.0% of total outstanding options. Certain of the options we issue become exercisable ratably over a period
of three years from the date of grant and have a contractual life of ten years from the date of grant, unless the holder's employment is terminated sooner. As of December 31, 2014, three-year
vesting options represented 34.3% of total outstanding options. Our non-employee directors are considered employees for purposes of our stock option plans and stock option reporting. Options granted
to our non-employee directors generally become exercisable one year from the date of grant.

Our
equity compensation plans generally provide that any unvested options and other awards granted thereunder shall vest immediately if an employee is terminated by the Company, or
terminates his or her own employment for good reason (as defined in each plan), in connection with a vesting change in control (as defined in each plan). On January 20, 2015, our stockholders
approved the adoption of the Iron Mountain Incorporated 2014 Stock and Cash Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan"). Under the 2014 Plan, the total amount of shares of common stock reserved and available for
issuance pursuant to awards granted under the 2014 Plan is 7,750,000. The 2014 Plan permits the Company to continue to grant awards through January 20, 2025.

A
total of 43,253,839 shares of common stock have been reserved for grants of options and other rights under our various stock incentive plans, including the 2014 Plan. The number of
shares available for grant under our various stock incentive plans, not including the 2014 Plan, at December 31, 2014 was 4,581,754.

The
weighted average fair value of options granted in 2012, 2013 and 2014 was $7.00, $7.69 and $5.70 per share, respectively. These values were estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following table summarizes the weighted average assumptions used for grants in the year ended December 31:

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units

Under our various equity compensation plans, we may also grant restricted stock or RSUs. Our restricted stock and RSUs generally have a
vesting period of between three and five years from the date of grant. All RSUs accrue dividend equivalents associated with the underlying stock as we declare dividends. Dividends will generally be
paid to holders of RSUs in cash upon the vesting date of the associated RSU and will be forfeited if the RSU does not vest. We accrued approximately $1,378, $1,854 and $3,698 of cash dividends on RSUs
for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. We paid approximately $58, $820 and $1,377 of cash dividends on RSUs for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and
2014, respectively. The fair value of restricted stock and RSUs is the excess of the market price of our common stock at the date of grant over the purchase price (which is typically zero).

Performance Units

Under our various equity compensation plans, we may also make awards of PUs. For the majority of PUs, the number of PUs earned is
determined based on our performance against predefined targets of revenue or revenue growth and return on invested capital ("ROIC"). The number of PUs earned may range from 0% to 150% (for PUs granted
prior to 2014) and 0% to 200% (for PUs granted in 2014) of the initial award. The number of PUs earned is determined based on our actual performance as compared to the targets at the end of either the
one-year performance period (for PUs granted prior to 2014) or the three-year performance period (for PUs granted in 2014). Certain PUs granted in 2013 and 2014 will be earned based on a market
condition associated with the total return on our common stock in relation to a subset of the S&P 500 rather than the revenue growth and ROIC targets noted above. The number of PUs earned based
on this market condition may range from 0% to 200% of the initial award. All of our PUs will be settled in shares of our common stock and are subject to cliff vesting three years from the date of the
original PU grant. For those PUs subject to a one-year performance period, employees who subsequently terminate their employment after the end of the one-year performance period and on or after
attaining age 55 and completing 10 years of qualifying service (the "retirement criteria") shall immediately and completely vest in any PUs earned based on the actual achievement against the
predefined targets as discussed above (but delivery of the shares remains deferred). As a result, PUs subject to a one-year performance period are generally expensed over the shorter of (1) the
vesting period, (2) achievement of the retirement criteria, which may occur as early as January 1 of the year following the year of grant or (3) a maximum of three years.
Outstanding PUs accrue dividend equivalents associated with the underlying stock as we declare dividends. Dividends will generally be paid to holders of PUs in cash upon the settlement date of the
associated PU and will be forfeited if the PU does not vest. We accrued approximately $369, $681 and $1,341 of cash dividends on PUs for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014,
respectively. There were no cash dividends paid on PUs for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013. We paid approximately $312 of cash dividends on PUs for the year ended December 31,
2014.

DECEMBER 31, 2014

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

In
2012, 2013 and 2014, we issued 221,781, 198,869 and 225,429 PUs, respectively. Our PUs are earned based on our performance against revenue or revenue growth and ROIC targets during
their applicable performance period; therefore, we forecast the likelihood of achieving the predefined revenue, revenue growth and ROIC targets in order to calculate the expected PUs to be earned. We
record a compensation charge based on either the forecasted PUs to be earned (during the applicable performance period) or the actual PUs earned (at the one-year anniversary date for PUs granted prior
to 2014, and at the three-year anniversary date for PUs granted in 2014) over the vesting period for each of the awards. For the 2013 and 2014 PUs that will be earned based on a market condition, we
utilized a Monte Carlo simulation to fair value these awards at the date of grant, and such fair value will be expensed over the three-year performance period. The total fair value of earned PUs that
vested during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 was $4,285, $2,962 and $1,216, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we expected 60% achievement of the predefined
revenue, revenue growth and ROIC targets associated with the awards of PUs made in 2014.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We offer an ESPP in which participation is available to substantially all United States and Canadian employees who meet certain service
eligibility requirements. The ESPP provides a way for our eligible employees to become stockholders on favorable terms. The ESPP provides for the purchase of our common stock by eligible employees
through successive offering periods. We have historically had two six-month offering periods per year, the first of which generally runs from June 1 through November 30 and the second of
which generally runs from December 1 through May 31. During each offering period, participating employees accumulate after-tax payroll contributions, up to a maximum of 15% of their
compensation, to pay the purchase price at the end of the offering. Participating employees may withdraw from an offering before the purchase date and obtain a refund of the amounts withheld as
payroll deductions. At the end of the offering period, outstanding options under the ESPP are exercised, and each employee's accumulated contributions are used to purchase our

common
stock. The price for shares purchased under the ESPP is 95% of the fair market price at the end of the offering period, without a look-back feature. As a result, we do not recognize
compensation expense for the ESPP shares purchased. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, there were 151,285 shares, 144,432 shares and 115,046 shares, respectively, purchased
under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2014, we have 960,638 shares available under the ESPP.

As
of December 31, 2014, unrecognized compensation cost related to the unvested portion of our Employee Stock-Based Awards was $35,467 and is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 1.9 years.

We
generally issue shares of our common stock for the exercises of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, PUs and shares of our common stock under our ESPP from unissued reserved shares.

o.

Income
Taxes

Accounting
for income taxes requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and
financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when recovery of deferred tax assets does not meet the more likely than not
standard as defined in GAAP. We have elected to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Income
(Loss) Per Share—Basic and Diluted

Basic
income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The calculation of diluted income (loss) per
share is consistent with that of basic income (loss) per share but gives effect to all potential common shares (that is, securities such as options, warrants or convertible securities) that were
outstanding during the period, unless the effect is antidilutive.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memo Reserves

We
maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments and potential
disputes regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables and credit memo activity, current
economic conditions and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or
impairment of their

r.

Concentrations
of Credit Risk

Financial
instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits), restricted cash
(primarily United States Treasuries) and accounts receivable. The only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of both December 31, 2013 and 2014 relate to cash and cash equivalents
and restricted cash held on deposit with one global bank and one "Triple A" rated money market fund, and three global banks and two "Triple A" rated money market funds, respectively, all of which we
consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade institutions. As per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any
one mutual fund to a maximum of $50,000 or in any one financial institution to a maximum of $75,000. As of December 31, 2013 and 2014, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balance
was $154,386 and $159,793, respectively, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $36,613 and $53,032 respectively. The money market funds are invested substantially in United
States Treasuries.

s.

Fair
Value Measurements

Entities
are permitted under GAAP to elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at either fair value or cost. We did not elect the fair value measurement option.

Our
financial assets or liabilities that are carried at fair value are required to be measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. A financial asset or
liability's classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

Level 1—Inputs
are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.



IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2014

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Level 2—Inputs
include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that
are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or
corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).

Level 3—Unobservable
inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

The
following tables provide the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively:

Our
derivative assets and liabilities primarily relate to short-term (six months or less) foreign currency contracts that we have entered into to hedge
certain of our intercompany exposures, as more fully disclosed at Note 3. We calculate the fair value of such forward contracts by adjusting the spot rate utilized at the balance sheet date for
translation purposes by an estimate of the forward points observed in active markets.

Disclosures
are required in the financial statements for items measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. We did not have any material items that are measured at fair value on a

Available-for-sale
and Trading Securities

We
have one trust that holds marketable securities. Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale or trading. As of December 31, 2013 and 2014, the fair value of the
money market and mutual funds included in this trust amounted to $13,386 and $13,172 respectively, and were included in
prepaid expenses and other in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We classified these marketable securities included in the trust as trading, and included in other expense (income), net in
the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations are realized and unrealized net gains (losses) of $1,292, $2,283 and $1,112 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014,
respectively, related to these marketable securities.

Investments

As
of December 31, 2014, we had a 4% investment in Crossroads Systems, Inc. Its carrying value as of December 31, 2013 and 2014 was $1,404 and $1,457, respectively, and is
included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. This investment, which is publicly traded, is carried at fair value with corresponding changes to fair value recorded in

New
Accounting Pronouncements

In
April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-08,

Presentation of Financial
Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360)

("ASU 2014-08"). ASU 2014-08 changes the criteria for a disposal to qualify as a
discontinued operation and requires additional disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. ASU 2014-08 is
effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. Under this guidance, we expect fewer dispositions to qualify as discontinued operations. Early adoption is permitted, but
only for disposals that have not been reported in the financial statements previously issued. We adopted ASU 2014-08 effective April 1, 2014.

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)

("ASU 2014-09"). ASU 2014-09
provides additional guidance for management to reassess revenue recognition as it relates to: (1) transfer of control, (2) variable consideration, (3) allocation of transaction
price based on relative standalone selling price, (3) licenses, (4) time value of money and (5) contract costs. Further disclosures will be required to provide a better
understanding of revenue that has been recognized and revenue that is expected to be recognized in the future from existing contracts. ASU 2014-09 is effective for us on January 1, 2017, with
no early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,

Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)

("ASU
2014-15"). ASU 2014-15 requires management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles of current United States auditing
standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term "substantial doubt", (2) require an evaluation every reporting period, including interim periods,
(3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of
management's plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is still present, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date
that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). ASU 2014-15 is effective for us on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We do not believe that this
pronouncement will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

In
February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,

Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis

("ASU
2015-02"). ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for us on January 1, 2016, with
early adoption permitted. We do not believe that this pronouncement will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

y.

Immaterial
Restatement

During
the second quarter of 2014, we identified contract billing inaccuracies arising from a single location which occurred over numerous years that resulted in an overstatement of our
prior years' reported revenue by $10,000 in the aggregate. Of this amount, $1,300 relates to the year ended December 31, 2013, $1,300 relates to the year ended December 31, 2012 and the
remaining $7,400 relates to the periods prior to December 31, 2011. We have determined that no prior period financial statement was materially misstated as a result of these billing
inaccuracies. As a result, we have restated beginning retained earnings as of December 31, 2011 for the cumulative impact of these billing inaccuracies, net of tax, prior to December 31,
2011 in the amount of $4,514.

Additionally,
we have restated the following: (1) our 2013 Consolidated Balance Sheet, (2) our 2012 and 2013 Consolidated Statements of Operations, (3) our 2012 and
2013 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), (4) our 2012 and 2013 Consolidated Statements of Equity and (5) our 2012 and 2013 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to
reflect the impact of these billing inaccuracies in those particular periods. There was no change to the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended
December 31, 2012 and 2013: (1) cash flows from
operating activities, (2) cash flows from investing activities and (3) cash flows from financing activities. Also, we restated the 2013 quarterly data presented in Note 8.

3. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We have entered into a number of separate forward contracts to hedge our exposures in Euros, British pounds sterling and Australian dollars. As of December 31, 2014, we had
outstanding forward contracts to purchase 206,000 Euros and sell $252,745 United States dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with our European operations. At the maturity of the forward
contracts, we may enter into new forward contracts to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward
contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. At the end of each month, we mark the
outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation. We have not designated forward contracts as hedges. During the years
ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, there was $9,116 in net cash payments, $6,954 in net cash receipts and $21,125 in net cash payments, respectively, included in cash from operating
activities from continuing operations related to settlements associated with foreign currency forward contracts.

Our
policy is to record the fair value of each derivative instrument on a gross basis. The following table provides the fair value of our derivative instruments as of December 31,
2013 and 2014 and their gains and losses for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014:

The
capital stock or other equity interests of most of our United States subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our
first-tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure these debt instruments, together with all intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) of subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our
United States subsidiary guarantors. In addition, Iron Mountain Canada Operations ULC ("Canada Company") has pledged 66% of the capital stock of its subsidiaries, and all intercompany
obligations (including promissory notes) owed to or held by it, to secure the Canadian dollar subfacility under the Revolving Credit Facility (defined below). The fair value (Level 3 of fair
value hierarchy described at Note 2.s.) of these debt instruments approximates the carrying value (as borrowings under these debt instruments are based on current variable market interest rates
(plus a margin that is subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio)), as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively.

(2)

The
fair values (Level 1 of fair value hierarchy described at Note 2.s.) of these debt instruments are based on quoted market prices for these
notes on December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively.

average interest rate of 5.8% at both December 31, 2013 and 2014, and (c) other various notes and other obligations, which were assumed by us as a result of certain acquisitions, of
$39,619 and $73,729 as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, and bear a weighted average interest rate of 14.3% and 11.5% as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively. We
believe the fair value (Level 3 of fair value hierarchy described at Note 2.s.) of this debt approximates its carrying value.

a.

Revolving
Credit Facility

On
August 7, 2013, we amended our existing credit agreement. The revolving credit facilities (the "Revolving Credit Facility") under our credit agreement, as amended (the "Credit
Agreement"), allow IMI and certain of its United States and foreign subsidiaries to borrow in United States dollars and (subject to sublimits) a variety of other currencies (including Canadian
dollars, British pounds sterling, Euros, Brazilian reais and Australian dollars, among other currencies) in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed $1,500,000. Additionally, the Credit Agreement
included an option to allow us to request additional commitments of up to $500,000, in the form of term loans or through increased commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. On
September 24, 2014, we borrowed an additional $250,000 in the form of a term loan under the Credit Agreement (the "Term Loan"). Commencing on December 31, 2014, the Term Loan will begin
amortizing in quarterly installments in an amount equal to $625 per quarter, with the remaining balance due on June 27, 2016. The Term Loan may be prepaid without penalty or premium, in whole
or in part, at any time. The Credit Agreement continues to
include an option to allow us to request additional commitments of up to $250,000, in the form of term loans or through increased commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The
Credit Agreement terminates on June 27, 2016, at which point all obligations become due. IMI and the Guarantors guarantee all obligations under the Credit Agreement, and have
pledged the capital stock or other equity interests of most of their United States subsidiaries, up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of their first-tier foreign subsidiaries, and
all intercompany

obligations
(including promissory notes) owed to or held by them to secure the Credit Agreement. In addition, Canada Company has pledged 66% of the capital stock of its subsidiaries, and all
intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) owed to or held by it to secure the Canadian dollar subfacility under the Revolving Credit Facility. The interest rate on borrowings under the
Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin, which varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio. Additionally, the Credit
Agreement requires the payment of a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, which fee ranges from between 0.3% to 0.5% based on certain financial ratios and fees
associated with outstanding letters of credit. As of December 31, 2014, we had $883,428 and $249,375 of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan,
respectively. Of the $883,428 of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, $680,150 was denominated in United States dollars, 77,200 was denominated in Canadian dollars, 64,250 was
denominated in Euros and 71,600 was denominated in Australian dollars. In addition, we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $10,403. The remaining amount available for borrowing
under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2014, based on IMI's leverage ratio, the last 12 months' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and rent
expense ("EBITDAR"), other adjustments as defined in the Credit Agreement and current external debt, was $606,169 (which amount represents the maximum availability as of such date). The average
interest rate in effect under the Credit Agreement was 2.7% as of December 31, 2014. The average interest rate in effect under the Revolving Credit Facility was 2.8% and ranged from 2.3% to
5.1% as of December 31, 2014 and the interest rate in effect under the Term Loan as of December 31, 2014 was 2.4%. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, we
recorded commitment fees and letter of credit fees of $2,306, $3,167 and $3,322, respectively, based on the unused balances under our revolving credit facilities and outstanding letters of credit. We
recorded a charge of $5,544 to other expense (income), net in the third quarter of 2013 related to an amendment of our revolving credit and term loan facilities, representing a write-off of deferred
financing costs.

The
Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our
ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger.
Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the Credit Agreement, our indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness. The Credit Agreement uses EBITDAR-based
calculations as the primary measures of financial performance, including leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios.
IMI's Credit Agreement net total lease adjusted leverage ratio was 5.0 and 5.4 as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5, and its net secured
debt lease adjusted leverage ratio was 2.2 and 2.6 as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 4.0. IMI's bond leverage ratio (which is not lease
adjusted), per the indentures, was 5.1 and 5.7 as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5. IMI's Credit Agreement fixed charge coverage ratio
was 2.5 at both December 31, 2013 and 2014 compared to a minimum allowable ratio of 1.5 under the Credit Agreement. Noncompliance with these leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios would have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.

5. Selected Consolidated Financial Statements of Parent, Guarantors, Canada Company and Non-Guarantors

The following data summarizes the consolidating results of IMI on the equity method of accounting as of December 31, 2013 and 2014 and for the years ended December 31,
2012, 2013 and 2014 and are prepared on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements.

The
Parent Notes, CAD Notes and GBP Notes are guaranteed by the subsidiaries referred to below as the Guarantors. These subsidiaries are 100% owned by IMI. The guarantees are full and
unconditional, as well as joint and several.

Additionally,
IMI and the Guarantors guarantee the CAD Notes, which were issued by Canada Company, and the GBP Notes, which were issued by IME. Canada Company and IME do not guarantee
the Parent Notes. The subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Parent Notes, the CAD Notes and the GBP Notes, including IME but excluding Canada Company, are referred to below as the Non-Guarantors.

In
the normal course of business we periodically change the ownership structure of our subsidiaries to meet the requirements of our business. In the event of such changes, we recast the
prior period financial information within this footnote to conform to the current period presentation in the period such changes occur. Generally, these changes do not alter the designation of the
underlying subsidiaries as Guarantors or Non-Guarantors. However, they may change whether the underlying subsidiary is owned by the Parent, a Guarantor, Canada Company or a Non-Guarantor. If such a
change occurs, the amount of investment in subsidiaries in the below balance sheets and equity in the earnings (losses) of subsidiaries, net of tax in the below statements of operations with respect
to the relevant Parent, Guarantors, Canada Company, Non-Guarantors and Eliminations columns also would change.

IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2014

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

6. Acquisitions

We account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, and, accordingly, the assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at their estimated fair values and the results
of operations for each acquisition have been included in our consolidated results from their respective acquisition dates. Cash consideration for our various acquisitions was primarily provided
through borrowings under our credit facilities and cash equivalents on-hand. The unaudited pro forma results of operations (including revenue and earnings) for the current and prior periods are not
presented due to the insignificant impact of the 2012, 2013 and 2014 acquisitions on our consolidated results of operations. Noteworthy acquisitions are as follows:

In
April 2012, in order to enhance our existing operations in Brazil, we acquired the stock of Grupo Store, a storage rental and records management and data protection business in Brazil
with locations in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre and Recife, for a purchase price of approximately $79,000 ($75,000, net of cash acquired). Included in the purchase price is approximately
$8,000 held in escrow to secure a working capital adjustment and the indemnification obligations of the former owners of the business ("Sellers") to IMI. In 2013, approximately $1,500 of the escrow
funds were released to the Sellers in connection with the final working capital adjustment. Unless paid to us in accordance with the terms of the agreement, all amounts remaining in escrow after any
indemnification payments are paid to the Sellers in four annual installments, commencing in April 2014.

In
May 2012, we acquired a controlling interest of our joint venture in Switzerland (Sispace AG), which provides storage rental and records and information management services, in a
stock transaction for a cash purchase price of approximately $21,600. The carrying value of the 15% interest that we previously held and accounted for under the equity method of accounting amounted to
approximately $1,700 as of the date of acquisition, and the fair value on the date of the acquisition of such interest was approximately $2,700. This resulted in a gain being recorded to other income
(expense), net of approximately $1,000 in the second quarter of 2012. The fair value of our previously held equity interest was derived by reducing the total estimated consideration for the
controlling interest purchased by 30%, which represents management's estimate of the control premium paid, in order to derive the fair value of $2,700 for the 15% noncontrolling equity interest which
we previously held. We determined the 30% control premium was appropriate after considering the size and location of the
business acquired, the potential future profits expected to be generated by the Swiss entity and other publicly available market data.

In
May 2013, in order to enhance our existing operations in the United States, we acquired a storage rental and records management business in Texas with locations in Michigan, Texas and
Florida, in a cash transaction for a purchase price of approximately $25,000.

In
June 2013, in order to enhance our existing operations in Brazil, we acquired the stock of Archivum Comercial Ltda. and AMG Comercial Ltda., storage rental and records
management businesses in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in a single transaction for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $29,000. Included in the purchase price is approximately $2,900 held in escrow to
secure a post-closing working capital adjustment and the indemnification obligations of the former owners of the businesses to us, to be released in annual installments through 2017.

DECEMBER 31, 2014

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

6. Acquisitions (Continued)

In
September 2013, in order to enhance our existing operations in Latin America, we acquired certain entities with operations in Colombia and Peru. We acquired the stock of G4S Secure
Data Solutions Colombia S.A.S. and G4S Document Delivery S.A.S (collectively, "G4S"). G4S, a storage rental and records management business with operations in Bogota, Cali, Medellin and
Pereira, Colombia, was acquired in a single transaction for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $54,000. We also acquired the stock of File Service S.A., a storage rental and records
management business in Peru, for a purchase price of approximately $16,000.

In
October 2013, in order to enhance our existing operations in the United States, we acquired Cornerstone Records Management, LLC and its affiliates, a national, full solution
records and information-management company, in a cash transaction for a purchase price of approximately $191,000. Included in the purchase price is approximately $9,000 held in escrow to secure
indemnification obligations and certain working capital adjustments.

In
January 2014, in order to enhance our existing operations in Australia, we acquired the stock of Tape Management Services Pty Ltd, a storage and data management company with
operations in Australia, for approximately $15,300.

In
February 2014, in order to enhance our existing operations in Turkey, we acquired the stock of RM Arşiv Yönetim Hizmetleri Ticaret Anonim
Şirketi, a storage
rental and records management business with operations in Turkey, for approximately $21,200, of which $16,750 was paid in the first quarter of 2014, with the remainder paid in the first quarter of
2015.

In
April 2014, in order to enhance our existing operations in Poland, we acquired the stock of OSG Polska sp. z.o.o., a storage rental and records management business with operations in
Poland, for approximately $13,700.

In
October 2014, in order to enhance our existing operations in Brazil, we acquired the stock of Keepers Brasil Ltda, a storage rental and data management business with operations
in Sao Paulo, Brazil, for approximately $46,200. The purchase price includes $5,425 held in escrow to secure indemnification obligations of the former owners of the business to us.

In
December 2014, in order to enhance our North American records management operations, we acquired the stock of Canadian-based Securit Records Management for approximately $29,500.
Included in the purchase price is approximately $1,300 held in escrow to secure indemnification obligations and certain working capital adjustments.

other payments of $(1,504) related to acquisitions made in previous years.

Consists
primarily of racking structures, leasehold improvements and computer hardware and software.

(3)

The
weighted average lives of customer relationship intangible assets associated with acquisitions in 2012, 2013 and 2014 was 17 years,
22 years and 17 years, respectively.

(4)

Consists
primarily of accounts payable, accrued expenses, notes payable, deferred revenue and deferred income taxes.

Allocations
of the purchase price paid for certain acquisitions made in 2014 were based on estimates of the fair value of net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment as additional
information becomes available to us. We are not aware of any information that would indicate that the final purchase price allocations for these 2014 acquisitions will differ meaningfully from
preliminary estimates. The purchase price allocations of these 2014 acquisitions are subject to finalization of the assessment of the fair value of intangible assets (primarily customer relationship
intangible assets), property, plant and equipment (primarily racking structures), operating leases, contingencies and income taxes (primarily deferred income taxes).

In
September 2014, we purchased our joint venture partners' noncontrolling interests in the businesses we operate in Russia, Ukraine and Denmark, which we had previously consolidated.

purchase
price of approximately $24,500 is comprised of $17,900 paid at closing, $2,100 payable in 2017 and $4,500 payable in 2020. The components of the purchase price payable in 2017 and 2020 are
reflected as non-cash items within our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2014. Of the $17,900 paid at closing, approximately $11,950 was associated with the
underlying shares owned by our joint venture partners and approximately $5,950 was associated with the payment of outstanding loans between the joint venture and the joint venture partners.

7. Income Taxes

As noted previously, on June 25, 2014, we announced that we received the favorable PLRs from the IRS necessary for our conversion to a REIT. In the PLRs, the IRS addressed and
favorably ruled on our assets and revenue model, including regarding our steel racking structures as real estate for REIT purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), our
global operations and our transition plans from a C corporation to a REIT. The PLRs are subject to certain qualifications and are based upon certain representations and statements made by us. If such
representations and statements are untrue or incomplete in any material respect (including as a result of a material change in relevant facts), we may not be able to rely on the PLRs. After receipt of
the PLRs, our board of directors unanimously approved our conversion to a REIT for our taxable year beginning January 1, 2014.

As
a REIT, we are generally permitted to deduct from our federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders. The income represented by such dividends is not subject to
federal taxation at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. The income of our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"), which hold our domestic operations that may not
be REIT-compliant as currently operated and structured, is subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. In addition, we and our subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign
income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through subsidiaries disregarded for federal tax purposes or TRSs. We will also
be subject to a separate corporate income tax on any gains recognized during a specified period (generally ten years) following the REIT conversion that are attributable to "built-in" gains with
respect to the assets that we owned on January 1, 2014; this built-in gains tax will also be imposed on our depreciation recapture recognized into income in 2014 and subsequent taxable years as
a result of accounting method changes commenced in our pre-REIT period. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate tax rates.
Even if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRS
operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for REITs, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some do not follow them at all.

The
tax basis of REIT assets, excluding investments in TRSs, is less than the amounts reported for such assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet by approximately $486,000 at
December 31, 2014.

As
of December 31, 2013, we have reclassified approximately $26,916 of long-term deferred income tax liabilities to current deferred income taxes (included within accrued expenses
within current liabilities) and prepaid and other assets (included within current assets) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the depreciation recapture associated with our
characterization

We
have federal net operating loss carryforwards, which expire in 2021 through 2033, of $88,090 ($0, tax effected) at December 31, 2014 to reduce future federal taxable income, on
which no federal tax benefit is expected to be realized. We have state net operating loss carryforwards, which expire in 2015 through 2033, of $74,439 ($112, tax effected) at December 31, 2014
to reduce future state taxable income, on which an insignificant state tax benefit is expected to be realized. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $64,606, with various expiration dates
(and in some cases no expiration date), subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 62%.

Our
effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 were 38.5%, 38.9% and (43.5)%, respectively. Our effective tax rate is subject to variability in the
future due to, among other items: (1) changes in the mix of income between our qualified REIT subsidiaries and our TRSs; (2) tax law changes; (3) volatility in foreign exchange
gains (losses); (4) the timing of the establishment

and
reversal of tax reserves; and (5) our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and net operating losses that we generate.

The
primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 were differences in the rates of
tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates and state income taxes (net of federal tax benefit).
During the year ended December 31, 2012, foreign currency gains were recorded in lower tax jurisdictions associated with our marking-to-market
of intercompany loan positions while foreign currency losses were recorded in higher tax jurisdictions associated with our marking-to-market of debt and derivative instruments, which lowered our 2012
effective tax rate by 2.2%. The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 were the impact from
the repatriation discussed below, which increased our 2013 effective tax rate by 13.1%, and state income taxes (net of federal tax benefit). These expenses were partially offset by a favorable impact
provided by the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits due to expirations of statute of limitation periods and settlements with tax authorities in various jurisdictions and
differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates.

During
2013, we completed a plan to utilize both current and carryforward foreign tax credits by repatriating approximately $252,700 (approximately $65,200 of which was previously
subject to United States taxes) from our foreign earnings. Due to uncertainty in our ability to fully utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards, we previously did not recognize a full benefit for such
foreign tax credit carryforwards in our tax provision. As a result, we recorded an increase in our tax provision from continuing operations in the amount of $63,504 in 2013. This increase was offset
by decreases of $18,753 from current year foreign tax credits and $23,301 reversal of valuation allowances related to foreign tax credit carryforwards, resulting in a net increase of $21,450 in our
tax provision from continuing operations.

On
September 13, 2013, the United States Department of the Treasury and the IRS released final tangible property regulations under Sections 162(a) and 263(a) of the Code
regarding the deduction and capitalization of expenditures related to tangible property. In addition, proposed regulations under Section 168 of the Code regarding dispositions of tangible
property have also been released. These final and proposed regulations are generally effective for our tax year beginning on January 1, 2014. Early adoption was available, and we adopted the
regulations in 2013. The impact from these regulations did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

As
a result of our REIT conversion, we recorded a net tax benefit of $212,151 during the year ended December 31, 2014 for the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and
liabilities associated with the REIT conversion. In 2014, we recorded an increase to the tax provision of $29,298 associated with tax accounting method changes consistent with our REIT conversion,
primarily affected through the filing of amended tax returns. The primary other reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate during the year ended
December 31, 2014 was an increase of $46,356 in our tax provision from the repatriation discussed below and other net tax adjustments related to the REIT conversion, including a tax benefit of
$63,333 primarily related to the

dividends
paid deduction. As a REIT, we are entitled to a deduction for dividends paid, resulting in a substantial reduction of federal income tax expense. As a REIT, substantially all of our income
tax
expense will be incurred based on the earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic TRSs.

7. Income Taxes (Continued)

We had not previously provided incremental federal and certain state income taxes on net tax over book outside basis differences related to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries
because our intent, prior to our conversion to a REIT, was to reinvest our current and future undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the United States. As a result
of our conversion to a REIT, it is no longer our intent to indefinitely reinvest our current and future undistributed foreign earnings outside the United States, and, therefore, during 2014, we
recognized an increase in our tax provision from continuing operations in the amount of $46,356, representing incremental federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on such foreign
earnings. As a REIT, future repatriation of incremental undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will not be subject to federal or state income tax, with the exception of foreign withholding
taxes in limited instances; however, such future repatriations will require distribution in accordance with REIT distribution rules, and any such distribution may then be taxable, as appropriate, at
the stockholder level.

The
evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a measurement process whereby
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the
largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

We
have elected to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Operations. We recorded an increase of $1,257, $1,459 and $1,462 for gross interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. We had $4,874
and $5,884 accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively.

A
summary of tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions is as follows:

The
normal statute of limitations for United States federal tax purposes is three years from the date the tax return is filed. The 2011, 2012 and 2013 tax years remain subject to
examination for United States federal tax purposes as well as net operating loss carryforwards utilized in these years. We utilized net operating losses from 2000, 2001 and 2008 in our federal income
tax returns for these tax years. The normal statute of limitations for state purposes is between three to five years. However, certain of our state statute of limitations remain open for periods
longer than this when audits are in progress.

We
are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have
business operations or a taxable presence. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities

and
provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2013, we had $51,146 of reserves related to uncertain tax positions included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2014, we had $55,951 of reserves related to uncertain tax positions, of which $53,078 and $2,873 is included in other long-term liabilities and
deferred income taxes, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related
litigation could result in changes in our estimates.

believe that it is reasonably possible that an amount up to approximately $6,560 of our unrecognized tax positions may be recognized by the end of 2015 as a result of a lapse of statute of limitations
or upon closing and settling significant audits in various worldwide jurisdictions.

by
an increase in foreign exchange transaction losses of approximately $11,000. Offsetting these benefits was a decrease in operating income of approximately $42,900. The decrease in operating income
is primarily attributable to: (1) $18,700 of restructuring costs associated with our organizational realignment, (2) $11,200 of facilities costs primarily associated with facility
consolidation, (3) $8,100 of other cost increases, including costs associated with recent acquisitions and executing our strategy,
(4) $3,600 of increased depreciation and amortization, primarily related to business acquisitions, (5) $3,000 in sales, marketing and account management costs within our North American
Records and Information Management Business and North American Data Management segments (primarily associated with sales commissions), (6) $2,200 of increased bad debt expense and
(7) $2,000 of charitable contributions, partially offset by a $7,100 decrease in REIT Costs (defined at Note 9) incurred in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2013.

(2)

The
change in net income (loss) attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the third quarter of 2014 is primarily
attributable to a decrease in the provision for income taxes recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the third quarter of 2014 of approximately $54,000. The decrease in the income tax
provision was offset by a decrease in operating income of approximately $13,600, a debt extinguishment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 of approximately $16,500 and an increase in
interest expense of $9,800. The decrease in operating income is attributable to a $8,300 increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to higher professional fees and
charitable contributions, as well as a $4,700 decrease in revenue, primarily due to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.

9. Segment Information

As a result of certain organizational realignments effective January 1, 2014, we evaluated changes to our internal financial reporting to better align our internal reporting to
how we will manage our business going forward. This evaluation resulted in changes to our reportable segments effective January 1, 2014. As a result of the changes to our reportable segments,
the former North American Business segment was separated into two unique reportable segments, which we refer to as (1) North American Records and Information Management Business segment and
(2) North American Data Management Business segment. In addition, the Emerging Businesses segment, which was previously reported as a component of the former North American Business segment, is
now reported as a component of the Corporate and Other segment. As a result, we have restated previously reported segment information.

Our
four reportable operating segments are described as follows:

•

North American Records and Information Management Business—storage and information management services throughout the
United States and Canada, including the storage of paper documents, as well as other media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, X-rays and blueprints, including
healthcare information services, vital records services, service and courier operations, and the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive

documents
for corporate customers ("Records Management"); information destruction services ("Destruction"); DMS; Fulfillment Services; and Intellectual Property Management.

•

North American Data Management Business—storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster
recovery plans throughout the United States and Canada, including service and courier operations ("Data Protection & Recovery"), server and computer backup services, digital content repository
systems to house, distribute, and archive key media assets, and storage, safeguarding and electronic or physical delivery of physical media of all types, primarily for entertainment and media industry
clients.

•

International Business—storage and information management services throughout Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific,
including Records Management, Data Protection & Recovery and DMS. Our European operations provide Records Management, Data Protection & Recovery and DMS throughout Europe. Our Latin
America operations provide Records Management, Data Protection & Recovery and DMS throughout Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Our Asia Pacific operations provide Records
Management, Data Protection & Recovery and DMS throughout Australia, with Records Management and Data Protection & Recovery also provided in certain cities in India, Singapore, Hong
Kong-SAR and China. Prior to December 2014, our International Business segment offered Destruction in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia. See Note 16 for further disclosure related to
the divestiture of these secure shredding operations in December 2014.

•

Corporate and Other—consists of our data center business in the United States, the primary product offering of our
Emerging Businesses segment, as well as costs related to executive and staff functions, including finance, human resources and information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. These
costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the
individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. Our Corporate and Other segment also includes stock-based employee compensation expense associated with all Employee
Stock-Based Awards.

a.

Leases

Most
of our leased facilities are leased under various operating leases that typically have initial lease terms of five to ten years. A majority of these leases have renewal options with
one or more five-year options to extend and may have fixed or Consumer Price Index escalation clauses. We also lease equipment under operating leases (primarily computers) which have an average lease
life of three years. Vehicles and office equipment are also leased and have remaining lease lives ranging from one to seven years. Total rent expense under all of our operating leases was $250,986,
$244,390 and $255,193 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.

Estimated
minimum future lease payments (excluding common area maintenance charges) include payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew results in an
economic disincentive due to significant capital expenditure costs (e.g., racking structures), thereby making it

Self-Insured
Liabilities

We
are self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers' compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under
employee healthcare and short-term disability programs. At December 31, 2013 and 2014 there were $32,850 and $33,381, respectively, of self-insurance accruals reflected in accrued expenses of
our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We
account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods
provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date.

c.

Litigation—General

We
are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. A portion of the defense and/or settlement costs associated with such litigation is covered by various
commercial liability insurance policies purchased by us and, in limited cases, indemnification from third parties. Our policy is to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the losses are both
probable and reasonably estimable. We record legal costs associated with loss contingencies as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. The matters described below represent our significant
loss contingencies. We have evaluated each matter and, if both probable and estimable, accrued an amount that represents our estimate of any probable loss associated with such matter. In addition, we
have estimated a reasonably possible range for all loss contingencies including those described below. We believe it is reasonably
possible that we could incur aggregate losses in addition to amounts currently accrued for all matters up to an additional $4,500 over the next several years, of which certain amounts would be covered
by insurance or indemnity arrangements.

d.

Government
Contract Billing Matter

Since
October 2001, we have provided services to the United States Government under several General Services Administration ("GSA") multiple award schedule contracts (the "Schedules").
The Schedules contain a price reductions clause ("Price Reductions Clause") that requires us to offer to reduce the prices billed under the Schedules to correspond to the prices billed to certain
benchmark commercial customers. In 2011, we initiated an internal review covering the contract period commencing in October 2006, and we discovered potential non-compliance with the Price Reductions
Clause. We voluntarily disclosed the potential non-compliance for that period to the GSA and its Office of Inspector General ("OIG") in June 2011.

In
April 2012, the United States Government sent us a subpoena seeking information that substantially overlapped with the subjects that were covered by the voluntary disclosure process
that we initiated with the GSA and OIG in June 2011, except that the subpoena sought information dating back to 2000, and sought information about non-GSA federal and state and local customers. In
June 2014, we learned that the government subpoena and investigation were the result of a pending, sealed

qui tam

lawsuit brought against us on behalf
of the United States and the State of California. In December 2014, we settled the lawsuit. As a result of the settlement, we paid the United States Government and the State of California $44,500 and
$1,250, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2014. There was no material impact to our consolidated statement of operations in 2014 as a result of the settlement as we had previously accrued and
maintained a deferred revenue liability related to this matter.

e.

Commonwealth
of Massachusetts Assessment

During
the third quarter of 2012, we applied for an abatement of assessments from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The assessments, issued in the second quarter of 2012, related to a
corporate excise audit of the 2004 through 2006 tax years in the aggregate amount of $8,191, including tax, interest and penalties through the assessment date. The applications for abatement were
denied during the third quarter of 2012. On October 19, 2012 we filed petitions with the Massachusetts Appellate Tax Board challenging the assessments. In addition, during the second quarter of
2013,



IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

10. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

Massachusetts
assessed tax for the 2007 and 2008 tax years in the aggregate amount of $4,120, including tax, interest and penalties through the assessment date. The assessment is for issues consistent
with those assessed in the earlier years. In the third quarter of 2013, we filed an application for abatement for the 2007 and 2008 tax years, which Massachusetts denied on October 15, 2013. On
December 13, 2013, we filed a petition with the Massachusetts Appellate Tax Board to challenge the assessment for the 2007 and 2008 tax years. In February 2015, we reached a settlement
agreement with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, under which we paid $6,000 to settle the assessments related to the 2004 through 2008 tax years. Additionally, following a corporate excise audit for
the 2009 through 2011 tax years, Massachusetts has issued Notices of Intention to Assess dated December 27, 2014 which set forth proposed corporate excise assessments in the aggregate amount of
$1,503, including tax, interest and penalties. We intend to defend this matter vigorously at the Massachusetts Appellate Tax Board.

f.

Italy
Fire

On
November 4, 2011, we experienced a fire at a facility we leased in Aprilia, Italy. The facility primarily stored archival and inactive business records for local area
businesses. Despite quick response by local fire authorities, damage to the building was extensive, and the building and its contents were a total loss. Although our warehouse legal liability insurer
has reserved its rights to contest coverage related to certain types of potential claims, we believe we carry adequate insurance. We have been sued by four customers, of which three of those matters
have been settled. We have also received correspondence from other customers, under various theories of liabilities. We deny any liability with respect to the fire and we have referred these claims to
our warehouse legal liability insurer for an appropriate response. We do not expect that this event will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows. As discussed in Note 14, we sold our Italian operations on April 27, 2012, and we indemnified the buyers related to certain obligations and contingencies associated with the fire.

Our
policy related to business interruption insurance recoveries is to record gains within other (income) expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and proceeds received
within cash flows from operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Such amounts are recorded in the period the cash is received. Our policy with respect to involuntary
conversion of property, plant and equipment is to record any gain or loss within (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment (excluding real estate), net within operating
income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and proceeds received within cash flows from investing activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Losses are recorded when
incurred and gains are recorded in the period when the cash received exceeds the carrying value of the related property, plant and equipment. As a result of the sale of the Italian operations,
statements of operations and cash flows related to the fire are reflected as discontinued operations.

Argentina
Fire

On
February 5, 2014, we experienced a fire at a facility we own in Buenos Aires, Argentina. As a result of the quick response by local fire authorities, the fire was contained
before the entire facility was destroyed and all employees were safely evacuated; however, a number of first responders lost their lives, or in some cases, were severely injured. The cause of the fire
is currently being investigated. We believe we carry adequate insurance and do not expect that this event will have a material impact to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows. Revenues from our operations at this facility represent less than 0.5% of our consolidated revenues.

11. Related Party Transactions

Paul F. Deninger, one of our directors, is a senior managing director at Evercore Group L.L.C. ("Evercore"). In May 2013, we entered into an agreement with Evercore, which was amended
and restated in August 2013 (the "Evercore Engagement"), pursuant to which Evercore agreed to provide financial advisory services to us in exchange for an aggregate fee of up to $3,000. In connection
with the Evercore Engagement, Mr. Deninger agreed, and Evercore represented, that Mr. Deninger would not be involved with the Evercore Engagement and would not receive any fees or direct
compensation in connection with the Evercore Engagement. The Evercore Engagement was approved by the audit committee of our board of directors in accordance with our Related Persons Transaction
Policy. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, we have incurred fees associated with the Evercore Engagement, including fees associated with the amendment of our Credit Agreement in
August 2013 and discounts and commissions attributable to Evercore's participation as one of the underwriters in the August 2013 Offerings, as well as monthly retention fees, of $2,750 and $250,
respectively.

12. 401(k) Plans

We have a defined contribution plan, which generally covers all non-union United States employees
meeting certain service requirements. Eligible employees may elect to defer from 1% to 25% of compensation per pay period up to the amount allowed by the Code. In addition, IME operates a defined
contribution plan, which is similar to our United States 401(k) Plan. We make matching contributions based on the amount of an employee's contribution in accordance with the plan documents. We have
expensed $18,026, $19,999 and $18,306 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.

13. Stockholders' Equity Matters

On September 15, 2014, we announced the declaration by our board of directors of a special distribution of $700,000 (the "Special Distribution"), payable to stockholders of record
as of September 30, 2014 (the "Record Date"). The Special Distribution represented the remaining amount of our undistributed earnings and profits attributable to all taxable periods ending on
or prior to December 31, 2013, which in accordance with tax rules applicable to REIT conversions, we were required to pay to our stockholders on or before December 31, 2014 in connection
with our conversion to a REIT. The Special Distribution also included certain items of taxable income that we recognized in 2014, such as depreciation recapture in respect of accounting method changes
commenced in our

pre-REIT
period as well as foreign earnings and profits recognized as dividend income. The Special Distribution followed an initial special distribution of $700,000 paid to stockholders in November
2012.

The
Special Distribution was paid on November 4, 2014 (the "Payment Date") to stockholders of record as of the Record Date in a combination of common stock and cash. Stockholders
had the right to elect to be paid their pro rata portion of the Special Distribution in all common stock or all cash, with the total cash payment to stockholders limited to no more than $140,000, or
20% of the total Special
Distribution, not including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. Based on stockholder elections, we paid $140,000 of the Special Distribution in cash, not including cash paid in lieu of fractional
shares, with the balance paid in the form of common stock. Our shares of common stock were valued for purposes of the Special Distribution based upon the average closing price on the three trading
days following October 24, 2014, or $35.55 per share, and as such, we issued approximately 15,750,000 shares of common stock in the Special Distribution. These shares impact weighted average
shares outstanding from the date of issuance, and thus impact our earnings per share data prospectively from the Payment Date.

In
November 2014, our board of directors declared a distribution of $0.255 per share (the "Catch-Up Distribution") payable on December 15, 2014 to stockholders of record on
November 28, 2014. Our board of directors declared the Catch-Up Distribution because our cash distributions paid from January 2014 through July 2014 were declared and paid before our board of
directors had determined that we would elect REIT status effective January 1, 2014 and were lower than they otherwise would have been if the final determination to elect REIT status effective
January 1, 2014 had been prior to such distributions.

In
February 2010, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we have paid, and in the future intend to pay, quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Declaration
and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors. In 2013 and 2014, our board of directors declared the following dividends:

13. Stockholders' Equity Matters (Continued)

During
the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, we declared distributions to our stockholders of $886,896, $206,365 and $1,048,905, respectively. These distributions
represent approximately $5.12 per share, $1.08 per share and $5.37 per share for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively, based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during each respective year. For each of 2012 and 2014, total amounts distributed included Special Distributions (as described above) of $700,000, or $4.07 and $3.61 per share,
respectively, associated with the Company's conversion to a REIT.

For
federal income tax purposes, distributions to our stockholders are generally treated as nonqualified ordinary dividends, qualified ordinary dividends or return of capital. The IRS
requires historical C corporation earnings and profits to be distributed prior to any REIT distributions, which may affect the character of each distribution to our stockholders, including whether and
to what extent each distribution is characterized as a qualified or nonqualified ordinary dividend. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the dividends we paid on our common
shares were classified as follows:

In
December 2013, our board of directors approved, and we entered into, a REIT Status Protection Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") which provided for a dividend of one preferred
stock purchase right (a "Right") for each share of our common stock outstanding on December 20, 2013. On November 18, 2014, we entered into the First Amendment to the Rights Agreement to
extend the expiration of the Rights Agreement from December 9, 2014 to February 28, 2015. On January 20, 2015, in connection with the merger with our predecessor, the Rights
Agreement was terminated.

14. Discontinued Operations

Digital Operations

On June 2, 2011, we sold the Digital Business to Autonomy pursuant to the Digital Sale Agreement. In the Digital Sale, Autonomy
purchased (1) the shares of certain of IMI's subsidiaries through which we conducted the Digital Business and (2) certain assets of IMI and its subsidiaries relating to the Digital
Business. The Digital Sale qualified as discontinued operations and, as a result, the financial position, operating results and cash flows of the Digital Business, for all periods presented, have been
reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes.

possible obligations and contingencies associated with the fire in Italy discussed more fully in Note 10.f. Our Italian operations were previously included within the International Business
segment. For all periods presented, the financial position, operating results and cash flows of our Italian operations, including the loss on the sale, have been reported as discontinued operations
for financial reporting purposes.

to the recovery of insurance proceeds in excess of carrying value.

15. Restructuring

In the third quarter of 2013, we implemented a plan that called for certain organizational realignments to advance our growth strategy and reduce operating costs, which was completed in
2014. As a result, we recorded restructuring costs of approximately $23,400 and $3,475 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, primarily related to employee severance and
associated benefits.

16. Divestitures

In December 2014, we divested our secure shredding operations in Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom (the "International Shredding Operations") in a stock transaction for
approximately $26,200 in cash at closing, including $1,500 being held in escrow. The assets sold primarily consisted of customer contracts and certain long-lived assets. We have concluded that this
divestiture is not a discontinued operation under the guidance in ASU 2014-08 described in Note 2.x. and, therefore, have recorded a pretax gain on sale in other (income) expense, net of
approximately $6,900 ($10,200, inclusive of a tax benefit) in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. Revenues from our International Shredding Operations
in 2014 represent less than 1% of our consolidated revenues. Approximately $7,750 of goodwill was allocated to the International Shredding Operations, utilizing a relative fair value approach. The
International Shredding Operations were previously included in our International Business segment.
