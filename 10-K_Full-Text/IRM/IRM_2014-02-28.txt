CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

We have made statements in this Annual Report that constitute "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined in the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other securities laws. These forward-looking statements concern our operations, economic performance, financial condition, goals, beliefs, future growth
strategies, investment objectives, plans and current expectations, such as our (1) commitment to future dividend payments, (2) expected growth in volume of records stored with us from
existing customers, (3) expected 2014 consolidated internal revenue growth rate and capital expenditures in 2014, (4) expected target leverage ratio, and (5) proposed conversion
to a real estate investment trust ("REIT"), including (i) the status of our pending private letter ruling (collectively, "PLRs") requests; (ii) the estimated timing of any such
conversion to a REIT; (iii) the estimated range of tax payments and other costs expected to be incurred in connection with our proposed conversion to a REIT; and (iv) the anticipated
benefits from our organizational realignment. These forward-looking statements are subject to various known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. When we use words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates" or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements.

Although
we believe that our forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from our
expectations. Important factors relating to our proposed conversion to a REIT that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, among others, with regard to our estimated tax and
other REIT conversion costs, our estimates may not be accurate, and such costs may turn out to be materially different than our estimates due to unanticipated outcomes in the PLRs from the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), the timing of a conversion to a REIT, changes in our support functions and support costs, the unsuccessful execution of internal planning, including restructurings
and cost reduction initiatives, or other factors.

In
addition, important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, among others:

•

the cost to comply with current and future laws, regulations and customer demands relating to privacy issues;

•

the impact of litigation or disputes that may arise in connection with incidents in which we fail to protect our
customers' information;

•

changes in the price for our storage and information management services relative to the cost of providing such storage
and information management services;

•

changes in customer preferences and demand for our storage and information management services;

•

the adoption of alternative technologies and shifts by our customers to storage of data through non-paper based
technologies;

•

the cost or potential liabilities associated with real estate necessary for our business;

•

the performance of business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management expertise outside the
U.S.;

•

changes in the political and economic environments in the countries in which our international subsidiaries operate;

iii


•

claims that our technology violates the intellectual property rights of a third party;

•

changes in the cost of our debt;

•

the impact of alternative, more attractive investments on dividends;

•

our ability or inability to complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms and to integrate acquired companies efficiently;
and

•

other trends in competitive or economic conditions affecting our financial condition or results of operations not
presently contemplated.

Other
risks may adversely impact us, as described more fully under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report.

You
should not rely upon forward-looking statements except as statements of our present intentions and of our present expectations, which may or may not occur. You should read these
cautionary statements as being applicable to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to release publicly the result of any revision
to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Readers are also urged to carefully
review and consider the various disclosures we have made in this document, as well as our other periodic reports filed with the SEC.

PART I

Item 1. Business.

A.    Development of Business.

We store records, primarily paper documents and data backup media, and provide information management services that help organizations around the world protect
their information, lower storage rental costs, comply with regulations, enable corporate disaster recovery, and better use their information for business advantages, regardless of its format, location
or lifecycle stage. We offer comprehensive records and information management services and data management services, along with the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information
management challenges such as rising storage rental costs, and increased litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery requirements. Founded in an underground facility near Hudson, New York
in 1951, Iron Mountain Incorporated, a Delaware corporation, is a trusted partner to more than 155,000 clients throughout North America, Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. We have a
diversified customer base consisting of commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 95% of the Fortune 1000. As of
December 31, 2013, we operated in 36 countries on five continents and employed over 19,500 people.

Now
in our 63rd year, we have experienced tremendous growth, particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in February 1996. We have
grown from a U.S. business operating fewer than 85 facilities (6 million square feet) with limited storage and information management service offerings and annual revenues of
$104.0 million in 1995 into a global enterprise providing storage and a broad range of related records and information management services to customers in markets around the world with over
1,000 facilities (66.9 million square feet) and total revenues of more than $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013. On January 5, 2009, we were added to the
S&P 500 Index, and as of December 31, 2013 we were number 644 on the Fortune 1000.

We
have transitioned from a growth strategy driven primarily by acquisitions of storage and information management services companies to a strategy that targets multiple sources of
revenue growth. Our current strategy is focused on: (i) increasing revenues in developed markets such as the United States, Canada, Australia and western Europe through improved sales and
marketing efforts and attractive fold-in acquisitions; (ii) establishing and enhancing leadership positions in high-growth emerging markets such as central and eastern Europe, Latin America and
the Asia Pacific region (excluding Australia), primarily through acquisitions; and (iii) continuing to identify, incubate and scale emerging business opportunities to support our long-term
growth objectives and drive solid returns on invested capital.

Storage
rental is the key driver of our economics and allows us to expand our relationships with our customers through value-added services that flow from storage rental. Consistent with
our overall strategy, we are focused on increasing incoming volumes on a global basis. There are multiple sources of new volumes available to us, and these sources inform our growth investment
strategy. Our investments in sales and marketing support sales to new customers that do not currently outsource some or all of their storage and information management needs, as well as increased
volumes from existing customers. We also expect to invest in the acquisitions of customer relationships and acquisitions of storage and information management services businesses. In our developed
markets, we expect that these acquisitions will primarily be fold-in acquisitions designed to optimize the utilization of existing assets, expand our presence and better serve customers. We also
expect to use acquisitions to expand our presence in attractive, higher growth emerging markets. Finally, we continue to pursue new rental streams through emerging business opportunities.

At
this stage in our evolution we have completed the initial optimization of our existing business operations. Consisting of productivity initiatives, pricing program improvements and
cost controls, our



optimization
strategy has produced significant and visible results. First, between 2006 and 2010, we focused on the North American Business segment, our largest business, and drove nearly 800 basis
points of improvement in that segment's Adjusted OIBDA margin (as defined below). Since 2010, our objective has been to sustain this segment's high margins while investing to support the revenue
growth. Following the optimization of our North American Business segment, and using many of the same initiatives and techniques, we achieved 700 basis points of improvement in the Adjusted OIBDA
margins of our International Business segment between 2010 and 2013. Beyond 2013, we expect to grow our consolidated Adjusted OIBDA margins at a much slower rate. In our developed markets, continuous
improvement initiatives will generate modest margin improvement, a portion of which we expect to reinvest in our business. In our existing emerging markets, margins should expand as the local
businesses scale, and we will look to reinvest a portion of that improvement to support the growth of these businesses. Further growth in our international margins will likely be limited as we seek to
add new emerging markets to the portfolio. Additionally, since 2006, we improved capital efficiency and reduced our capital expenditures (excluding real estate and REIT Costs, as defined below) as a
percent of revenues from 13.4% in 2006 to 7.4% in 2013.

Adjusted
OIBDA is defined as operating income before (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) intangible impairments, (3) (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of
property, plant and equipment, net and (4) costs associated with our 2011 proxy contest, the work of the former Strategic Review Special Committee of our board of directors (the "Special
Committee") and the proposed REIT conversion, discussed below (collectively "REIT Costs"). Adjusted OIBDA margin is defined as Adjusted OIBDA as a percent of revenues. For more detailed definitions
and reconciliations of Adjusted OIBDA and a discussion of why we believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors, see "Item 7. Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Measures" of this Annual Report.

We
are committed to delivering stockholder value. To that end, and supported by our increased profitability and strong cash flows, we initiated a stockholder payout program in February
2010 and a dividend policy under which we have paid, and in the future intend to pay, cash dividends on our common stock. Our first ever quarterly cash dividend, declared in March 2010, was $0.0625
per share. We have since increased our quarterly dividend on three occasions, including most recently in June 2012, when we announced an 8% increase to our regular quarterly dividend payments through
2013. The June 2012 increase to our quarterly dividend, to $0.27 per share, represented a 332% increase over the quarterly dividend amount declared in March 2010.

In
April 2011, we announced a three-year strategic plan to increase stockholder value. A major component of that plan was our commitment to significant stockholder payouts of
$2.2 billion through
2013, with $1.2 billion being paid out by May 2012. We fulfilled the commitment to return $1.2 billion of cash to stockholders by May 2012. The remaining $1.0 billion of the
stockholder payout plan has been replaced by our regular quarterly dividends and the stockholder distributions and expenditures associated with our plan to convert to a REIT (the "Conversion Plan").
Since May 2012 we have returned $1.1 billion of capital to stockholders including $490.5 million in cash and $560.0 million in common stock. As part of this earlier strategic
plan, in June 2011, we completed the sale of our online backup and recovery, digital archiving and eDiscovery solutions businesses (the "Digital Business") for approximately $395.4 million in
cash. Additionally, in connection with our strategic portfolio review of certain international operations, we sold our New Zealand operations in October 2011, and we sold our Italian operations in
April 2012.

Potential REIT Conversion

In June 2012, we announced our intention to pursue conversion to a REIT. The Conversion Plan was unanimously approved by our board of
directors following a thorough analysis and careful consideration of ways to maximize value through alternative financing, capital and tax strategies, and



after
the unanimous approval of the Special Committee. Our Conversion Plan includes submitting PLR requests to the IRS. Our PLR requests have multiple components, and the conversion to a REIT will
require favorable rulings from the IRS on numerous technical tax issues, including the characterization of our racking structure assets as real estate. We submitted our PLR requests to the IRS during
the third quarter of 2012, but the IRS may not provide a favorable response to our PLR requests until sometime in 2014, or at all.

Even
though we have not yet determined if we will be able to convert to a REIT, we began operating our business in a manner consistent with being a REIT effective January 1, 2014
so that we and our stockholders will benefit from our status (our "REIT Status") as a REIT under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") in 2014 if we are ultimately successful
in becoming a REIT for 2014. Any REIT election made by us must be effective as of the beginning of a taxable year; therefore, if, as a calendar year taxpayer, we are unable to convert to a REIT
effective January 1, 2014, the next possible conversion date would be January 1, 2015.

Our
ability to qualify as a REIT will depend upon our continuing compliance following our conversion to a REIT with various requirements, including requirements related to the nature of
our assets, the sources of our income and the distributions to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will
be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and
property. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the U.S. federal income tax regime for REITs described above, many states do not completely follow U.S. federal rules and some
may not follow them at all. We will continue to make estimated tax payments in compliance with applicable corporate U.S. federal income tax laws and regulations until we are successful in converting
to a REIT.

We
believe that electing REIT Status will maximize our enterprise value as we advance our strategy and provide significant benefits to our stockholders. A key component of our capital
allocation strategy is to return excess cash to our stockholders, and we believe operating as a REIT aligns well with this strategy. In November 2012, we paid a $700.0 million special dividend
(the "Special Dividend") representing the initial distribution to satisfy the requirement that we pay to stockholders our accumulated earnings and profits which is estimated to be approximately
$1.2 billion to $1.7 billion (the "E&P Distribution") in connection with our potential conversion to a REIT. The Special Dividend consisted of $140.0 million paid in cash and
$560.0 million in common stock value. We issued 17.0 million new shares in connection with the Special Dividend. We also believe that through conversion to a REIT we may be able to
expand our shareholder base and lower our cost of financing through increased ownership of currently leased real estate. We expect our long-term capital allocation strategy as a REIT will naturally
shift toward increased use of equity to support lower leverage, though our leverage may increase in the short-term to fund the costs to support the Conversion Plan.

See
Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview" and "—Liquidity and Capital Resources" of this
Annual Report for more information regarding our possible conversion to a REIT, including anticipated costs associated with the Conversion Plan, and Item 1A. "Risk Factors—Risks
Related to the Proposed REIT Conversion" of this Annual Report for a discussion of risks associated with our conversion to a REIT, including impediments to a conversion.

B.    Description of Business.

Overview

We provide cost-effective secure storage for all major media, including paper (which is the primary form of records storage we
provide), as well as secure off-site storage of data backup media. Our related information management services can be broadly divided into two major categories: records and



information
management services and data management services. Media formats can be broadly divided into physical and electronic records. We define physical records to include paper documents, as well
as all other non-electronic media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, X-rays and blueprints. Electronic records include e-mail and various forms of magnetic media such
as computer tapes, hard drives and optical disks.

Our
records and information management services include: flexible retrieval access, retention management, including the destruction of documents stored in our records facilities upon the
expiration of their scheduled retention periods, and records management program development and implementation based on best practices to help customers comply with specific regulatory requirements
and policy-based programs. Also included within records and information management services are our secure shredding services and our scanning, imaging and document conversion services of active and
inactive records, or Document Management Solutions ("DMS"). Shredding services involve the secure shredding of sensitive documents in a way that ensures privacy and a secure chain of custody for the
records. This service typically includes the scheduled pick-up of loose office records, which customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers that we provide, and the on-site destruction
of those records in specially designed vehicles or the off-site destruction at one of our secure shred plants. DMS helps organizations gain better access to, and ultimately control over, their paper
records by digitizing, indexing and hosting them in online archives to provide complete information lifecycle solutions. Within the records management services category, we have developed specialized
services for vital records and regulated industries such as healthcare, energy, government and financial services.

In
addition to our core records and information management services, we provide consulting, facilities management, fulfillment and other outsourcing services relating to storage and
information management.

Our
data management services include the secure handling and transportation of data backup media for fast and efficient data recovery in the event of a disaster, human error or virus as
well as disaster preparedness, planning and support. We also provide secure destruction of media and IT equipment. Our technology-based data management services include online backup and recovery
solutions for desktop and laptop computers and remote servers. Since our sale of the Digital Business, we offer these technology-based services primarily through partnerships. Additionally, we serve
as a trusted, neutral third party and offer technology escrow services to protect and manage source code and other proprietary information.

Physical Records

Physical records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. Active records relate to ongoing and recently
completed activities or contain information that is frequently referenced. Active records are usually stored and managed on-site by their owners to ensure ready availability. Inactive physical records
are the principal focus of the storage and information management services industry and consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be retained for legal,
regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. A large and growing specialty subset of the physical records market is medical records. These
are active and semi-active records that are often stored off-site with, and serviced by, a storage and information management services vendor. Special regulatory requirements often apply to medical
records.

Electronic Records

Electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of
recently processed data or archival in nature. We believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they



face
in their physical records management programs and consist primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access to and control over the data in a secure
environment; and (3) the need to retain electronic records due to regulatory requirements or for litigation support. Customer needs for data backup and recovery and archiving are distinctively
different. Backup data exists because of the need of many businesses to be able to recover the data in the event of a system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. It is customary (and a best
practice) for data processing groups to rotate backup tapes to off-site locations on a regular basis and to require multiple copies of such information at multiple sites. In addition to the physical
storage and rotation of backup data that we provide, we offer online backup services through partnerships as an alternative way for businesses to store and access data. Online backup is a Web-based
service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop and laptop computers over the Internet and stores it in secure data centers.

Growth of Market

We believe that the volume of stored physical and electronic records will continue to increase on a global basis for a number of
reasons, including: (1) regulatory requirements; (2) concerns over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of records; (3) the
continued proliferation of data processing technologies such as personal computers and networks; (4) inexpensive document producing technologies such as desktop publishing software and desktop
printing; (5) the high cost of reviewing records and deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and
(7) the need to keep backup copies of certain records in off-site locations for business continuity purposes in the event of disaster.

We
believe that the creation of paper-based information will be sustained, not in spite of, but because of, "paperless" technologies such as e-mail and the Internet. These technologies
have prompted the creation of hard copies of such electronic information and have also led to increased demand for electronic records services, such as the storage and off-site rotation of backup
copies of magnetic media. In addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital information technologies and distributed data networks has created a growing need for efficient, cost-effective,
high quality technology solutions for electronic data protection and the management of electronic documents.

Acquisitions in a Highly Fragmented Industry

The storage and information management services industry has long been and remains a highly fragmented industry with thousands of
competitors in North America and around the world. Between 1995 and 2004 there was significant acquisition activity in the industry. Acquisitions were a fast and efficient way to achieve scale, expand
geographically and broaden service offerings. We believe this acquisition activity, which is ongoing, is due to the opportunities for large providers to achieve economies of scale and meet customer
demands for sophisticated, technology-based solutions. Attractive acquisition opportunities, many of which are small, in North America and internationally continue to exist, and we expect to continue
to pursue acquisition of these businesses where we believe they present a good opportunity to create value for our stockholders.

Characteristics of Our Business

We generate our revenues by renting storage space to a large and diverse customer base in 66.9 million square feet of real
estate around the globe and providing to our
customers an expanding menu of related and ancillary products and services. Providing outsourced storage is the mainstay of our customer relationships and serves as the foundation for all our revenue
growth. Services are a vital part of a comprehensive records management program and consist primarily of the handling and transportation of stored records and information, shredding, DMS, data
restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology services, product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies), and recurring project
revenues. Shredding consists primarily of the



scheduled
collection and shredding of records and documents generated by business operations and the sale of recycled paper resulting from shredding services.

In
general, our North American Business and our International Business segments offer storage and the information management services discussed below, in their respective geographies.
The amount of revenues derived from our North American Business and International Business segments and other relevant data, including financial information about geographic areas and product and
service lines, for fiscal years 2011, 2012 and 2013 are set forth in Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Secure Storage

Renting secure space to customers for the purpose of storing paper records and data backup media is by far our largest source of
revenue. Records storage consists primarily of the archival storage of records for long periods of time according to applicable laws, regulations and industry best practices. The secure off-site
storage of data backup media is a key component of a company's disaster recovery and business continuity programs and storage rental charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis.

Hard
copy business records are typically stored for long periods of time with limited activity in cartons packed by the customer. For some customers we store individual files on an open
shelf basis, and these files are typically more active. Storage rental charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis, usually per cubic foot of records, and include the provision of
space, racking systems, computerized inventory and activity tracking, and physical security.

Vital
records contain critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film and other highly proprietary information, such as energy data. Vital records may
require special facilities,
either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. Accordingly, our charges for providing enhanced security and special climate-controlled environments for vital records
are higher than for typical storage rental.

Service Offerings

Our services can be broadly divided into two major categories: records and information management services and data management
services. We offer both physical services and technology solutions in the records and information management and data management categories.

Records and Information Management Services

Central to any records management program is the handling and transportation of stored records and the eventual destruction of those
records upon the expiration of their scheduled retention periods. This is accomplished through our extensive service and courier operations. Our other records and information management services
include shredding services, DMS services, Compliant Records Management and Consulting Services, Health Information Storage and Management Solutions, Entertainment Services, Energy Data Services,
Discovery Services and other ancillary services.

Service
and courier operations are an integral part of our comprehensive records management program for all physical media and include adding records to storage, temporarily removing
records from storage, refiling of removed records, permanently withdrawing records from storage and destroying records. Service charges are generally assessed for each activity on a per unit basis.
Courier operations consist primarily of the pick-up and delivery of records upon customer request. Charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location, and are billed
monthly. As of December 31, 2013, our fleet consisted of approximately 3,800 owned or leased vehicles.

Our
information destruction services consist primarily of physical secure shredding operations. Secure shredding is a natural extension of our hard copy records management services,
completing the



lifecycle
of a record, and involves the shredding of sensitive documents for customers that, in many cases, also use our services for management of archival records. These services typically include
the scheduled pick-up of loose office records that customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide. Complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste
paper to third-party recyclers. Through a combination of plant-based shredding operations and mobile shredding units consisting of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services
to our customers throughout the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and Latin America.

The
focus of our DMS business is to develop, implement and support comprehensive storage and information management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers' information. We
seek to develop solutions that solve our customers' document management challenges by integrating the management of physical records, document conversion and digital storage. Our DMS services
complement our service offerings and enhance our existing customer relationships. We differentiate our offerings from our competitors by providing solutions that integrate and expand our existing
portfolio of products and services. The trend towards increased usage of Electronic Document Management ("EDM") systems represents another opportunity for us to manage active records. Our DMS services
provide the bridge between customers' physical documents and their EDM solutions.

We
offer records and information management services that have been tailored for specific industries, such as health care, or to address the needs of customers with more specific
requirements based on the critical nature of their records. For example, medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide
easier access to individual files. In addition to storing medical records, we provide health care information services, which include the handling, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records
used by hospitals, private practitioners and other medical institutions, as well as recurring project work and ancillary services. Recurring project work involves the on-site removal of aged patient
files and related computerized file indexing. Ancillary healthcare information services include release of information (medical record copying and delivery), temporary staffing, contract coding,
facilities management and imaging.

We
offer a variety of additional services which customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. These services include conducting records inventories, packing records into
cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. We also provide services for the management of active records programs. We can provide these services,
which generally include document and file processing and storage, both off-site at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel to perform management functions on-site at the customer's
premises. We also sell a full line of specially designed corrugated cardboard storage cartons.

Other
services that we provide include fulfillment and professional consulting services. Fulfillment services are performed by our wholly owned subsidiary, Iron Mountain Fulfillment
Services, Inc. ("IMFS"). IMFS stores marketing literature and other materials for its customers and delivers this material to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' locations
based on current and
prospective customer needs. In addition, IMFS assembles custom marketing packages and orders and manages and provides detailed reporting on customer marketing literature inventories. A growing element
of the content we manage and fulfill is stored digitally and printed on demand by IMFS. Digital print allows marketing materials such as brochures, direct mail, flyers, pamphlets and newsletters to be
personalized to the recipient with variable messages, graphics and content.

We
provide professional consulting services to customers, enabling them to develop and implement comprehensive storage and information management programs. Our consulting business draws
on our experience in storage solutions and information management services to analyze the practices of companies and assist them in creating more effective programs to store records and manage
information. Our consultants work with these customers to develop policies and schedules for document retention and destruction.



The
growth rate of critical digital information is accelerating, driven in part by the use of the Internet as a distribution and transaction medium. The rising cost and increasing
importance of storing and managing digital information, coupled with the increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may create meaningful opportunities for us to provide
solutions to our customers with respect to their digital records storage and management challenges. We continue to cultivate marketing and technology partnerships to support this anticipated growth.

We
sold our domain name management product line in 2010 and the Digital Business, including our former wholly owned subsidiaries, Mimosa Systems, Inc. and Stratify, Inc.,
and our New Zealand operations in 2011. Also, we sold our Italian operations in April 2012. Consistent with our treatment of acquisitions, we eliminated all revenues associated with these businesses,
which have all been reflected as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes, from the calculation of our internal growth rates for 2011, 2012 and 2013.

Data Management Services

Our data management services are designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to satisfy industry best practices with
regard to disaster recovery and business continuity purposes. We provide data management services for both physical and electronic records. We also offer technology escrow services in this category.

Physical
data management services consist of the rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery and business continuity plans. Computer tapes, cartridges and
disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where they are available to customers 24 hours a day,
365 days a year, to facilitate data recovery in the event of a disaster. Frequently, backup tapes are rotated from our facilities back to our customers' data centers. We also manage tape
library relocations and support disaster recovery testing and execution.

Online
backup is a Web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop or laptop computers over the Internet and stores it in secure data
centers. After the sale of the Digital Business, we continue to offer this service pursuant to a reseller agreement with Autonomy Corporation plc, a corporation formed under the laws of England
and Wales ("Autonomy").

Through
our technology escrow services business, we act as a trusted, neutral, third party, safeguarding valuable technology assets—such as software source code, object code
and data—in secure, access-protected escrow accounts. Acting in this intermediary role, we help document and maintain intellectual property integrity. The result is increased control and
leverage for all parties, enabling them to protect themselves, while maintaining competitive advantage.

Financial Characteristics of Our Business

Our financial model is based on the recurring nature of our various revenue streams. The historical predictability of our revenues and
the resulting Adjusted OIBDA allow us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. Our business has the following financial characteristics:

•

Recurring Revenues.

We derive a majority of our
consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, storage rental fees charged to customers based on the volume of their records stored. Once a customer places physical records in storage
with us, and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed (for which we typically receive a service fee), we receive recurring payments for storage rental without incurring additional
labor or marketing expenses or significant capital costs. Similarly, contracts for the storage of electronic backup media involve primarily fixed monthly rental payments. Our annual revenues from
these fixed periodic storage rental fees have grown for 25 consecutive years. During the three years 2011 through 2013,



storage
rental revenues, which are stable and recurring, have increased from approximately 56% to 59% of our total consolidated revenues. This stable and growing storage rental revenue base also
provides the foundation for increases in service revenues and Adjusted OIBDA.

•

Historically Non-Cyclical Storage Rental
Business.

Historically, we have not experienced significant reductions in our storage rental business as a result of economic downturns
although, during recent economic slowdowns, the rate at which some customers added new cartons to their inventory was below historical levels. However, during the most recent economic downturn, which
was more severe and lasted longer than other recent downturns, destruction rates increased as some customers were more willing to incur additional short-term service costs in exchange for lower
storage rental costs in the long-term. In addition, we experienced longer sales cycles and lower incoming volumes from existing customers, due in large part, we believe, to high unemployment rates and
generally lower levels of business activity. Combined, these impacts resulted in lower net volume growth rates. The net effect of these factors has been the continued growth of our storage rental
revenue base, albeit at a lower rate. Total net volume growth, including acquisitions, was approximately 2%, 3% and 6% on a global basis for 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

•

Inherent Growth from Existing Physical Records
Customers.

Our physical records customers have, on average, sent us additional cartons at a faster rate than stored cartons have been
destroyed or permanently removed. However, during the most recent economic downturn, the combination of lower incoming volumes from existing customers and increased destruction rates, as described
above, resulted in lower consolidated net volume growth in recent quarters, including negative net volume growth from existing customers at times in certain markets. Since reaching unusually high
levels in 2009, our destruction rates have stabilized at rates closer to historical norms. Following improvement in the economy, we expect our growth from existing customers will improve, although we
cannot give any assurance as to how much, if any, improvement we will realize. We believe the continued growth of our physical records storage rental revenues is the result of a number of factors,
including the trend toward increased records retention, albeit at a lower rate of growth, customer satisfaction with our services and contractual net price increases.

•

Diversified and Stable Customer Base.

As of
December 31, 2013, we had over 155,000 clients in a variety of industries in 36 countries around the world. We currently provide storage and information management services to commercial,
legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 95% of the Fortune 1000. No single customer accounted for as much as 2% of our
consolidated revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013. For each of the three years 2011 through 2013, the average annual volume reduction due to customers terminating
their relationship with us was less than 3%.

•

Capital Expenditures Related Primarily to Business Line Growth and Ongoing
Operations.

Our business requires significant capital expenditures to support our expected storage rental revenue and service revenue
growth and ongoing operations, new products and services and increased profitability. As the nature of our business has evolved over time, so has the nature of our capital expenditures. Every year we
expend capital to support a number of different objectives. The majority of our capital goes to support business line growth and our ongoing operations. Additionally, we invest capital to acquire or
construct real estate. We also expend capital to support the development and improvement of products and services and projects designed to increase our profitability. These expenditures are generally
relatively small and discretionary in



nature.
Below are descriptions of the major types of capital expenditures we are likely to make in a given year:

•

Capital to support business line growth

—these expenditures are
primarily related to capacity expansion such as investments in new racking structures, carton storage systems, tape storage systems and containers, shredding plants and bins and technology service
storage and processing capacity.

•

Capital to acquire/construct real estate

—these expenditures
are directly related to the acquisition of real estate, either through the purchase or construction of a new facility or the buyout of an existing lease.

•

Capital to support ongoing business operations

—these
expenditures are primarily related to major repairs and/or the replacement of assets, such as facilities, warehouse equipment and computers. This category also includes operational support initiatives
such as sales and marketing and information technology projects to support infrastructure requirements.

•

Capital for new product development

—these expenditures are
directly related to the development of new products or services in support of our integrated value proposition.

•

Capital for product improvement

—these expenditures are
primarily related to product and service enhancements that support our leadership position in the industry. Spending in this area includes items such as increased feature functionality, security
upgrades or system enhancements.

•

Capital to support operational efficiencies

—these expenditures
are primarily related to driving increased profitability through cost savings and operating efficiencies and include items such as facility consolidations and systems to support operating process
improvements.

Following
is a table presenting our capital expenditures for 2011, 2012 and 2013 organized by the nature of the spending as described above:

We believe that capital expenditures, net of real estate and capital expenditures that are part of our REIT Costs, incurred as a percent of revenues is a
meaningful metric for investors because it indicates the efficiency with which we are investing in the growth and operational efficiency of our business. For the years 2011 through 2013, our total
capital expenditures, net of real estate and capital expenditures that are part of our REIT Costs, incurred as a percent of revenues were approximately 6.6%, 6.1% and 7.4%, respectively. The increase
in 2013 is due primarily to capital expenditures associated with recent acquisitions, the relocation of our Boston headquarters and certain capital projects that were accelerated from 2014 into 2013.

Growth Strategy

We offer our customers an integrated value proposition by providing them with secure storage and comprehensive service offerings,
including records and information management services and data management services. We have the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges, such as
rising storage rental costs and increased litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery requirements. We expect to maintain a leadership position in the storage and information management
services industry around the world by enabling customers to store, protect and better use their information—regardless of its format, location or lifecycle stage—so they can
optimize their business and ensure proper recovery, compliance and discovery.

Our
objective is to continue to capitalize on our brand, our expertise in the storage and information management industry and our global network to enhance our customers' experience,
thereby increasing our customer retention rates and attracting new customers. Our near-term growth objectives include a set of specific initiatives: (i) increasing revenues in developed markets
such as the United States, Canada, Australia and western Europe through improved sales and marketing efforts and attractive
fold-in acquisitions; (ii) establishing and enhancing leadership positions in high-growth emerging markets such as central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region



(excluding
Australia), primarily through acquisitions; and (iii) continuing to identify, incubate and scale emerging business opportunities to support our long-term growth objectives and drive
solid returns on invested capital. Our overall growth strategy will focus on growing our business organically, making strategic customer acquisitions and pursuing acquisitions of storage and
information management businesses and developing ancillary businesses.

Introduction of New Products and Services

We continue to expand our portfolio of products and services. Adding new products and services allows us to strengthen our existing
customer relationships and attract new customers in previously untapped markets.

Growth from Existing Customers

Our existing customers' storage of physical records contributes to the growth of storage rental and certain records and information
management services revenues because, on average, our existing customers generate additional cartons at a faster rate than old cartons are destroyed or permanently removed. However, during the most
recent economic downturn, the combination of lower incoming volumes from existing customers, due in large part, we believe, to high unemployment rates and generally lower business activity, and
increased destruction rates, resulted in lower consolidated net volume growth in recent quarters, including negative net volume growth from existing customers at times in certain markets. Since
reaching unusually high levels in 2009, our destruction rates have stabilized at rates closer to historical norms. Following the improvement in the economy, we expect our growth from existing
customers will improve, although we cannot give any assurance as to how much, if any, improvement we will realize. In order to maximize growth opportunities from existing customers, we seek to
maintain high levels of customer retention by providing premium customer service through our local account management staff.

Our
sales coverage model is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by strategically allocating our sales resources to our customer base and selling
additional storage, records and information management services and products in new and existing markets within our existing customer relationships. These services and products include special project
work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies).

Expanding New and Existing Customer Relationships

Our sales forces are dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer account relationships;
(2) generating additional revenue by expanding existing customer relationships globally; and (3) expanding new and existing customer relationships by effectively selling a wide array of
related services and products. In order to accomplish these objectives, our sales forces draw on our U.S. and international marketing organizations and senior management.

Growth through Acquisitions

The goal of our acquisition program is to supplement internal growth by continuing to expand our presence in targeted emerging markets,
continuing to make fold-in acquisitions in developed markets and expanding our rental streams, new service capabilities and industry-specific services. We have a successful record of acquiring and
integrating storage and information management services companies.

Acquisitions in Developed Markets

We have acquired, and we continue to seek to acquire, storage and information management services businesses in developed markets
including the United States, Canada, Australia and western



Europe.
Given the relatively small size of most acquisition targets in our core physical businesses in these markets, where we believe they present a good opportunity to create value for our
stockholders, future acquisitions are expected to be less significant to our overall revenue growth in these markets than in the past. Occasionally, however, we may be presented with the opportunity
to acquire one of the larger businesses in these markets and will evaluate each opportunity with a focus on return on invested capital and the creation of stockholder value. Such was the case with our
acquisition in October 2013 of Cornerstone Records Management, LLC and its affiliates ("Cornerstone").

Acquisitions in the Emerging Markets

We expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments in storage and information management services businesses in targeted
emerging markets outside the United States, Canada, Australia and western Europe. We have acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire and invest in, storage and information management services
companies in certain countries, and, more specifically, certain markets within such countries, where we believe there is potential for significant growth. Future acquisitions and investments will
focus primarily on expanding priority markets in central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region.

The
experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important in our emerging market acquisition strategy. Since beginning our international expansion program in
January 1999, we have, directly and through joint ventures, expanded our operations into more than 35 countries. These transactions have taken, and may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of an
entire business or controlling or minority investments with a long-term goal of full ownership. We believe a joint venture strategy, rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets,
better position us to expand the existing business. The local partners benefit from our expertise in the storage and information management services industry, our multinational customer relationships,
our access to capital and our technology, while we benefit from our local partners' knowledge of the market, relationships with local customers and their presence in the community. In addition to the
criteria we use to evaluate developed market acquisition candidates, when looking at an emerging market acquisition, we also evaluate risks uniquely associated with an international investment,
including those risks described below. Our long-term goal is to acquire full ownership of each business in which we make a joint venture investment. We now own more than 98% of our international
operations, measured as a percentage of consolidated revenues. In connection with the strategic review of certain of our international businesses, we sold our New Zealand operations in October 2011
and our Italian operations in April 2012.

Our
international investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as
fluctuations in currency
valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors.

The
amount of our revenues derived from international operations and other relevant financial data for fiscal years 2011, 2012 and 2013 are set forth in Note 9 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, we derived approximately 34%, 35% and 36%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside of the U.S.
As of December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, we had long-lived assets of approximately 36%, 37% and 36%, respectively, outside of the U.S.

Competition

We are a global leader in the physical storage and information management services industry with operations in 36 countries. We compete
with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities. We can provide no assurance that these organizations will begin or continue to use an
outside company such as Iron Mountain for their future storage and information management services.



We also compete with numerous storage and information management services providers in every geographic area where we operate. The physical storage and
information management services industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of competitors in North America and around the world. We believe that competition for customers is based on price,
reputation for reliability, quality and security of storage, quality of service and scope and scale of technology and that we generally compete effectively in each of these areas.

Alternative Technologies

We derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of paper documents and computer backup tapes and from storage related
services. This storage requires significant physical space, which we provide through our owned and leased facilities. Alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less
space than paper documents and tapes. These technologies include computer media, microform, CD-ROM and optical disk and use of the cloud for electronic data. To date, none of these technologies has
replaced paper documents as the primary means for storing information. However, we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records as paper documents. We
continue to provide additional services
such as online backup, primarily through partnerships, designed to address our customers' need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality solutions for electronic records and storage and information
management.

Employees

As of December 31, 2013, we employed over 8,500 employees in the U.S. and over 11,000 employees outside of the U.S. At
December 31, 2013, an aggregate of 529 employees were represented by unions in California, Georgia and three provinces in Canada.

All
union and non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability, retirement/401(k)
and accidental death and dismemberment plans, except for certain unionized employees in California, who receive these types of benefits through the unions. In addition to base compensation and other
usual benefits, all full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits, collections or attainment of specified
objectives for the unit in which they work. Management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and unions. All union employees are currently under renewed labor agreements or
operating under an extension agreement.

Insurance

For strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and
that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. Property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage),
subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. Property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income
loss and extra expense. Other types of insurance that we carry, which are also subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles, include: medical, workers' compensation, general
liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse legal liability and directors' and officers' liability policies.

Our
customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records or information stored with us. Our liability under
physical storage contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. Our liability under our DMS services and other service contracts is often
limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract. We cannot provide assurance that where we have limitation of liability provisions that they will be enforceable in all instances or would
otherwise protect us from



liability.
Also, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. In addition to provisions
limiting our liability, our standard storage rental and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and
service delivery terms. Our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. While we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of
their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, we can give no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future.

Environmental Matters

Some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other
purposes that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. In some instances this prior use involved the operation of
underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. Although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our
former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. We therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs and may be unable to
sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be liable for environmental compliance and remediation
costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the
contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. Environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the
future. In addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today.

We
transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers
all owned and leased locations. Coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Our businesses face many risks. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our businesses,
financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. Our current and potential investors should consider the following risks
and the information contained under the heading "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" before deciding to invest in our securities.



Risks Related to the Proposed REIT Conversion

Although we have chosen to pursue conversion to a REIT, we may not be successful in converting to a REIT effective as of January 1, 2014, or
at all.

As previously announced in June 2012, our board of directors unanimously approved the Conversion Plan to pursue conversion to a REIT
under the Code. We are in the process of implementing the Conversion Plan, pursuant to which we would elect REIT Status no earlier than our taxable year beginning January 1, 2014. One of the
conditions that must be met in order to complete our conversion to a REIT is obtaining favorable PLRs from the IRS. Our PLR requests have multiple components, and our conversion to a REIT will require
favorable rulings from the IRS on a number of technical tax issues, including the characterization of our racking structures as real estate (the "Racking Structure Request"). In this regard, in the
course of our communications with the IRS relating to our PLR requests, we disclosed in June 2013 that the IRS informed us that it formed an internal working group to study the legal standards the IRS
uses to define "real estate" for purposes of the REIT provisions of the Code and what changes or refinements, if any, should be made to those legal standards. The IRS also informed us that it was
"tentatively adverse" to ruling that our racking structures constitute "real estate" for REIT purposes. In November 2013, the IRS stated that it will resume issuing rulings regarding the definition of
"real estate" for purposes of the REIT provisions of the Code, and the IRS is continuing to evaluate our PLR requests, including the Racking Structure Request. We can provide no assurance that the IRS
will ultimately provide us with a favorable PLR on the Racking Structure Request or our other PLR requests, or that any favorable PLR will be received in a timely manner for us to convert successfully
to a REIT effective January 1, 2014.

There
are other significant implementation and operational complexities to address in connection with converting to a REIT, including obtaining favorable PLRs from the IRS as discussed
above, completing internal reorganizations relating to certain of our international operations, testing and validating accounting, information technology and real estate system modifications
implemented in connection with the Conversion Plan, receiving stockholder approvals, and making required stockholder payouts, and the timing and outcome of many of these are outside our control.
Further, changes in legislation or the federal tax rules could adversely impact our ability to convert to a REIT and/or the attractiveness of converting to a REIT. Similarly, even if we are able to
satisfy the existing REIT requirements, the tax laws, regulations and interpretations governing REITs may change at any time in ways that could be disadvantageous to us.

Even
if the transactions necessary to implement REIT conversion are successfully effected, including receipt of favorable PLRs, our board of directors may decide not to elect REIT
Status, or to delay such election, if it determines in its sole discretion that it is not in the best interests of our stockholders. While we have not yet determined if we will be able to convert to a
REIT, we have determined that we will begin to operate our business in a manner consistent with being a REIT effective January 1, 2014 so that we and our stockholders will benefit from our REIT
Status in 2014 if we are ultimately successful in becoming a REIT effective in 2014. However, we can provide no assurance if or when conversion to a REIT will be successful. Furthermore, if we do
convert, the effective date of the REIT conversion could be delayed beyond January 1, 2014, in which event we could not elect REIT Status until the taxable year beginning January 1,
2015, at the earliest.

We may not qualify or remain qualified as a REIT, and/or may not realize the anticipated benefits to stockholders, including the achievement of tax
savings for us, increases in income distributable to stockholders, the potential to lower our cost of financing through increased ownership of currently leased real estate and the expansion of our
stockholder base.

If we convert to a REIT, we plan to operate in a manner consistent with REIT qualification rules; however, we cannot provide assurance
that we will, in fact, qualify as a REIT or remain so qualified. REIT qualification involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code, to



our
operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. There are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these
provisions.

Even
if we are successful converting to a REIT and electing REIT Status, we cannot provide assurance that our stockholders will experience benefits attributable to our qualification and
taxation as a REIT, including our ability to (1) reduce our corporate level federal tax through distributions to stockholders, (2) lower our cost of financing or (3) expand our
stockholder base. The realization of the anticipated benefits to stockholders will depend on numerous factors, many of which are outside our control, including interest rates. In addition, future
distributions to stockholders will depend on our cash flows, as well as the impact of alternative, more attractive investments as compared to dividends. Further, changes in legislation or the federal
tax rules could adversely impact the benefits of being a REIT.

Complying with REIT qualification requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.

To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and to remain so qualified, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among
other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our common stock. For example, under the Code,
no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more U.S. taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS") and other nonqualifying assets. This limitation may affect
our ability to make large investments in other non-REIT qualifying operations or assets. As such, compliance with REIT tests may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including
the purchase of significant nonqualifying assets and the material expansion of non-real estate activities.

There are uncertainties relating to our estimate of our E&P Distribution, as well as the timing of such E&P Distribution and the percentage of common
stock and cash we may distribute.

We have provided an estimated range of the E&P Distribution. We are in the process of conducting a study of our pre-REIT accumulated
earnings and profits as of the close of our 2012 taxable year using our historical tax returns and other available information. This is a very involved and complex study that is not yet complete, and
the actual result of the study relating to our pre-REIT accumulated earnings and profits as of the close of our 2012 taxable year may be materially different from our current estimates. In addition,
the estimated range of our E&P Distribution is based on our projected taxable income for our 2013 taxable year and our current business plans and performance, but our actual earnings and profits (and
the actual amount of the E&P Distribution) will vary depending on, among other items, the timing of certain transactions, our actual taxable income and performance for 2013 and possible changes in
legislation or tax rules and IRS revenue procedures relating to distributions of earnings and profits. For these reasons and others, our actual E&P Distribution may be materially different from our
estimated range.

In
the fourth quarter of 2012, we paid to our stockholders a Special Dividend of $700 million, which represented the initial portion of the expected E&P Distribution. We expect
the balance of the E&P Distribution will be paid in 2014 if we successfully convert to a REIT, but the timing of the planned payment of the remaining E&P Distribution, which may or may not occur, may
be affected by the completion of various phases of the Conversion Plan and other factors beyond our control. The Special Dividend was paid in the aggregate of 20% in cash and 80% in shares of our
common stock. We may decide, based on our cash flows and strategic plans, IRS revenue procedures relating to distributions of earnings and profits, leverage and other factors, to pay the remaining
portion of the E&P Distribution entirely in cash or a different mix of cash and common stock.



We may be required to borrow funds and/or raise equity to satisfy our E&P Distribution.

Depending on the ultimate size and timing of the stockholder distributions, we may raise debt and/or issue equity in the near-term to
fund these disbursements, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings or offerings. Whether we issue equity, at what price and the amount and other terms of
any such issuances will depend on many factors, including alternative sources of capital, our then-existing leverage, our need for additional capital, market conditions and other factors beyond our
control. If we raise additional funds through
the issuance of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities, the percentage of stock ownership by our existing stockholders may be reduced. In addition, new equity securities or
convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders, which could substantially decrease the value of our securities owned by them.
Depending on the share price we are able to obtain, we may have to sell a significant number of shares in order to raise the capital we deem necessary to execute our long-term strategy, and our
stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares as a result. Furthermore, satisfying our E&P Distribution and other conversion costs may increase the financing we need to fund
capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives. As a result, our indebtedness could increase. See "Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness" for further information regarding our substantial
indebtedness.

Our REIT Status Protection Rights Agreement may not protect our potential status as a REIT and could have unintended antitakeover effects and may
prevent our stockholders from receiving a takeover premium.

In December 2013 we entered into a REIT Status Protection Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") with Computershare Inc., as
rights agent. In connection with the Rights Agreement, we declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right (a "Right") for each share of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
"Common Stock") outstanding on December 20, 2013. We entered into the Rights Agreement in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to provide for the preservation of our potential
REIT Status by limiting ownership concentration that could threaten our potential REIT Status. However, since the exercisability of the Rights, or the exchange (an "Exchange") therefor by us for
shares of Common Stock or our Series A Participating Junior Preferred Stock (or another series of our preferred stock having equivalent rights, preferences and privileges), at an exchange rate
of one share of Common Stock, or a fractional share of Preferred Stock (or other stock) equivalent in value thereto, per Right, is triggered only after a person or group has exceeded beneficial
ownership of in excess of 9.8% of our Common Stock, as calculated in accordance with the Rights Agreement (the "Ownership Threshold"), the Rights Agreement, by its terms, cannot prevent a stockholder
from exceeding the Ownership Threshold and thereby threatening our potential REIT Status. Nevertheless, we expect that the potential for substantial dilution to a person or group that exceeds the
Ownership Threshold will strongly discourage a stockholder from exceeding such Ownership Threshold and becoming an Acquiring Person, as defined in the Rights Agreement. While the decision by our board
of directors to consider a person or group an Acquiring Person and/or consummate an Exchange would likely reduce such Acquiring Person's ownership below the Ownership Threshold, we can provide no
assurance that effecting an Exchange or otherwise triggering the exercisability of the Rights would retroactively remove the threat to our potential REIT Status that resulted from such Acquiring
Person exceeding the Ownership Threshold in the first place. Also, the tax consequences to a REIT of triggering a Rights Agreement are unclear, and we can provide no assurance that we will consummate
an Exchange or allow the exercisability of the Rights to be triggered even if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of the outstanding Common Stock of greater than the Ownership Threshold.
While we have entered into the Rights Agreement to assist with our REIT compliance under the Code if we are able to convert to a REIT, the Rights Agreement also could inhibit acquisitions of a
significant stake in us and may prevent a change in our control. As a result, the overall effect of the Rights may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us even if such
acquisition may be favorable to the interests of our stockholders. Because our



board
of directors can redeem the Rights at any time in their sole discretion, the Rights should not interfere with a merger or other business combination approved by our board of directors.

We have no experience operating as a REIT, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations if we successfully
convert to a REIT.

We have no experience operating as a REIT and our senior management has no experience operating a REIT. Our pre-REIT operating
experience may not be sufficient to prepare us to operate successfully as a REIT. Our inability to operate successfully as a REIT, including the failure to maintain REIT Status, could adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Operational Risks

Our customers may shift from paper and tape storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space.

We derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of paper documents and computer backup tapes and from storage related
services. This storage requires significant physical space, which we provide through our owned and leased facilities. Alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less
space than paper documents and tapes. These technologies include computer media, microform, CD-ROM, optical disk and use of the cloud for electronic data. U.S. federal government initiatives have
resulted in many health care providers adopting programs to evolve to greater use of electronic medical records. In addition, as alternative technologies are adopted, storage related services may
decline as the physical records or tapes we store become less active and more archived. We can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records in paper documents
or tape format. The adoption of alternative technologies may also result in decreased demand for services related to the paper documents and tapes we store. A significant shift by our customers to
storage of data through non-paper or tape based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses.

As stored records become less active our core service revenue growth and profitability may decline.

Our records management service revenue growth is being negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records are becoming
less active. The amount of information available to customers through the Internet or their own information systems has been steadily increasing in recent years. As a result, while we continue to
experience growth in storage rental, our customers are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records, thereby reducing their service activity levels. At the same time many of our
costs related to records related services remain fixed. In addition, our reputation for providing secure information storage is critical to our success, and actions to manage cost structure, such as
outsourcing certain transportation, security or other functions, could negatively impact our reputation and adversely affect our business. Ultimately, if we are unable to appropriately align our cost
structure with decreased levels of service revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected.

Changes in customer behavior with respect to document destruction and pricing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We have experienced pricing pressure in recent years as some customers have become more cost conscious with respect to their
information management expenditures. Some customers have taken actions designed to reduce costs associated with the retention of documents, including reducing the volume of documents they store and
adopting more aggressive destruction practices. If we are unable to increase pricing over time, or if rates of destruction of documents stored with us increase substantially, particularly in our
developed and slower growing markets, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.



Governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. We may not be able to fully offset these costs through
increases in our rates. In addition, incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information against security breaches could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage
our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations.

In reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, almost all
U.S. states have adopted breach of data security statutes or regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information, such as social security numbers, is
breached. In addition, certain federal laws and regulations affecting financial institutions, health care providers and plans and others impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of
information maintained by those institutions as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. Some of these laws and regulations provide for
civil fines in certain circumstances and require the adoption and maintenance of privacy and information security programs; our failure to be in compliance with any such programs may adversely affect
our business. One U.S. state has adopted regulations requiring every company that maintains or stores personal information to adopt a comprehensive written information security program. In some
instances European data protection authorities have issued large fines as a result of data security breaches.

Continued
governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action. For example, in the past the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would expand the
federal data breach notification requirement beyond the financial and medical fields. In addition, the European Commission has proposed a regulation and directive that will, if adopted, supersede
Directive 95/46/EC, which has governed the processing of personal data since 1995. It is anticipated that the proposed regulation will significantly alter the security and privacy obligations of
entities, such as Iron Mountain, that process data of residents of members of the European Union and substantially increase penalties for violations. Also, an increasing number of countries have
introduced and/or increased enforcement of comprehensive privacy laws, or are expected to do so. The continued emphasis on information security as well as increasing concerns about government
surveillance may lead customers to request that we take additional measures to enhance security and assume higher liability under our contracts. We have experienced incidents in which customers'
backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed by customers that some of the incidents involved the loss of personal information, resulting in monetary costs to those
customers for which we have provided reimbursement. As a result of legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security.
Any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset any increased expenses.

In
addition to increases in the costs of operations or potential liability that may result from a heightened focus on data security, our reputation may be damaged by any compromise of
security, accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession. We believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers. If our
reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.

Changing fire and safety standards may result in significant expense in certain jurisdictions.

As of December 31, 2013, we operated 944 records management and off-site data protection facilities worldwide, including 570 in
the United States alone. Many of these facilities were built and outfitted by third parties and added to our real estate portfolio as part of acquisitions. Some of these facilities contain fire
suppression and safety features that are different from our current specifications and current standards for new facilities, although we believe all of our facilities were constructed in



compliance
with laws and regulations in effect at the time of their construction or outfitting. Where we believe the fire suppression and safety features of a facility require improvement, we will
develop and implement a plan to remediate the issue. In some instances local authorities having jurisdiction may take the position that our fire suppression and safety features in a particular
facility are insufficient and require additional measures which may involve considerable expense to us. If additional fire safety and suppression measures beyond our current operating plan were
required at a large number of our facilities, the expense required for compliance could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in contract interpretation.

Our customer contracts typically contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to,
records or information stored with us. Our liability under physical storage contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot and our liability
under our DMS services and other service contracts is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract; however, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the
contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. We cannot provide assurance that where we have limitation of liability provisions they will be enforceable in all
instances or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. In addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage rental and service contracts include a
schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and service delivery terms. Our customers may dispute the interpretation of various
provisions in their contracts. In the past, we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been
material, but we can give no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. Although we maintain a
comprehensive insurance program, there is no assurance we will be able to maintain insurance policies on acceptable terms in order to cover losses to us in connection with customer contract disputes.

Failure to comply with certain regulatory and contractual requirements under our U.S. Government contracts could adversely affect our revenues,
operating results and financial position.

Selling our services to the U.S. Government subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. Failure to comply with
these requirements could subject us to investigations, price reductions, up to treble damages, and civil penalties. Noncompliance with certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result
in us being suspended or barred from future U.S. Government contracting. We may also face private derivative securities claims as a result of adverse government actions. Any of these outcomes could
have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial position and reputation.

International operations may pose unique risks.

As of December 31, 2013, we provided services in 35 countries outside the U.S. As part of our growth strategy, we expect to
continue to acquire or invest in storage and information management services businesses in select foreign markets, including countries where we do not currently operate. International operations are
subject to numerous risks, including:

•

the impact of foreign government regulations and U.S. regulations that apply to us wherever we operate; in particular,
Iron Mountain is subject to U.S. and foreign anticorruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and, although we have implemented internal controls, policies and
procedures and training to deter prohibited practices, employees, partners, contractors or agents may violate or circumvent such policies and the law;



•

the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate;

•

political uncertainties;

•

unforeseen liabilities, particularly within acquired businesses;

•

costs and difficulties associated with managing international operations of varying sizes and scale;

•

the risk that business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise in
some markets outside of the U.S. will not perform as expected;

•

difficulties attracting and retaining local management and key employees to operate our business in certain countries;

•

cultural differences and differences in business practices and operating standards; and

•

foreign currency fluctuations.

In
particular, our net income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies associated with certain intercompany balances of our foreign subsidiaries owed to us and between
our foreign subsidiaries.

We may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our business.

Because our business is heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. Such
risks include:

•

variable occupancy costs and difficulty locating suitable sites due to fluctuations in real estate markets;

•

uninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis
for some casualties, such as fires, earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities;

•

inability to use our real estate holdings effectively and costs associated with vacating or consolidating facilities if
the demand for physical storage were to diminish because our customers choose other storage technologies or because competitors attract our customers; and

•

liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased
by us, whether or not (i) we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or (ii) the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property.

Some
of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation
and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. In some instances this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of
asbestos-containing materials. Although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not
undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. We therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent,
mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. Environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. In addition,
future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today.

Unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.

Unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, war or
terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and



failure
of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. Our customers rely on us to securely store and timely retrieve their critical information, and these
events could result in customer service disruption, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities and the information stored in those facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key
operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems, each of which could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations. During the past several years we have seen an
increase in severe storms and hurricanes and our key facilities in Florida and other coastal areas in particular are subject to this inherent risk.

Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our reputation for providing highly secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. Our reputation
or brand, and specifically, the trust our customers place in us, could be negatively impacted in the event of perceived or actual failures by us to store information securely. For example, events such
as fires, natural disasters, attacks on our information technology systems or security breaches involving Iron Mountain could negatively impact our reputation, particularly if such incidents result in
adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. Damage to our reputation could make us less competitive, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and results of operations.

Our operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. In particular, our secure
shredding operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper to recyclers. We generate additional revenue through a customer surcharge when the price of diesel fuel rises above certain
predetermined rates. As a result, significant declines in paper and diesel fuel prices may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations, and increases in other commodity prices, including
steel, may negatively impact our results of operations.

Attacks on our internal information technology systems could damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of
operations.

Our reputation for providing secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. We have previously
faced attempts by unauthorized users to gain access to our information technology systems and expect to continue to face such attempts. Although we seek to prevent, detect and investigate these
security incidents and have taken steps to prevent such security breaches, there can be no assurance that attacks by unauthorized users will not be attempted in the future or that our security
measures will be effective. A successful breach of the security of our information technology systems could lead to theft or misuse of our customers' proprietary or confidential information and result
in third party claims against us and reputational harm. If our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of
operations.

We may be subject to claims that our technology violates the intellectual property rights of a third party.

Third parties may have legal rights (including ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights) to ideas, materials,
processes, names or original works that are the same or similar to those we use. Third parties have in the past, and may in the future, bring claims, or threaten to bring claims, against us that
allege that their intellectual property rights are being infringed or violated by our use of intellectual property. Litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior
management from operating our business. Further, if we cannot establish our right or obtain the right to use the intellectual property on reasonable terms, we may be required to develop alternative
intellectual property at our expense to mitigate potential harm.



We face competition for customers.

We compete with multiple storage and information management services providers in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or
potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. We also compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information
management services capabilities. These organizations may not begin or continue to use a third party, such as Iron Mountain, for their future storage and information management service needs.

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt
instruments.

We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2013, our total long-term debt was approximately
$4.17 billion, our stockholders' equity was approximately $1.06 billion and our cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) totaled approximately $0.15 billion. Our
substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our current and potential investors. Our indebtedness may increase as we continue to borrow under existing and future credit arrangements
in order to finance future acquisitions, to fund the Conversion Plan and for general corporate purposes, which would increase the associated risks. These risks include:

•

inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments;

•

inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions;

•

inability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements,
including possible required repurchases of our various indebtedness or the payment of quarterly dividends;

•

limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information management services
industry;

•

limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our
indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs;

•

inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; and

•

restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms.

Restrictive debt covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy.

Our credit facility and our indentures contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other
things:

•

incur additional indebtedness;

•

pay dividends or make other restricted payments;

•

make asset dispositions;

•

create or permit liens; and

•

make acquisitions and other investments.

These
restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies.



We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes upon a change
of control event as required by our indentures.

Upon the occurrence of a "change of control", we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior or senior subordinated
notes. However, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes or that restrictions in our revolving credit
facility will not allow such repurchases. Certain important corporate events, however, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a
"change of control" under our indentures.

Iron Mountain is a holding company, and, therefore, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations depends in part on the operations of
our subsidiaries.

Iron Mountain is a holding company; substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our subsidiaries, and substantially all of
our operations are conducted by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of
sufficient funds from our subsidiaries. However, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by most, but not all, of our direct and indirect
wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries.

Acquisition and Expansion Risks

Elements of our strategic growth plan involve inherent risks.

As part of our strategic growth plan, we have undergone a significant management reorganization, and we expect to invest in new
business strategies, products, services, technologies and geographies and we may selectively divest certain businesses. These initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including
distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenues to offset expenses and liabilities associated with new investments, inadequate return of capital on these investments and the
inability to attract, develop and retain skilled employees to lead and support new initiatives. For example, in 2013 we expanded our entry into the data center market by leasing wholesale and retail
colocation space in our underground facility in Pennsylvania, and we broke ground on our first regional data center in Northborough, Massachusetts, which required a significant capital commitment.
Many of these new ventures are inherently risky and no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful in achieving the desired returns within a reasonable timeframe, if
at all, and that they will not adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Failure to manage our growth may impact operating results.

If we succeed in expanding our existing businesses, or in moving into new areas of business, that expansion may place increased demands
on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. If not managed effectively, these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to
customers. In addition, our personnel, systems,
procedures and controls may be inadequate to support future operations, particularly with respect to operations in countries outside of the U.S. or in new lines of business. Consequently, in order to
manage growth effectively, we may be required to increase expenditures to increase our physical resources, expand, train and manage our employee base, improve management, financial and information
systems and controls, or make other capital expenditures. Our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting,
forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth.



Failure to successfully integrate acquired operations could negatively impact our balance sheet and results of operations.

Strategic acquisitions are an important element of our growth strategy and the success of any acquisition we make depends in part on
our ability to integrate the acquired company and realize anticipated synergies. The process of integrating acquired businesses, particularly in new markets, may involve unforeseen difficulties and
may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. We can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage
the operations of any acquired business or realize anticipated synergies. The failure to successfully integrate the cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies of an acquired
business could have a material adverse effect on our balance sheet and results of operations.

We may be unable to continue our international expansion.

An important part of our growth strategy involves expanding operations in international markets, including in markets where we
currently do not operate, and we expect to continue this expansion. Europe, Latin America and Australia have been our primary areas of focus for international expansion, and we have expanded into the
Asia Pacific region to a lesser extent. We have entered into joint ventures and have acquired all or a majority of the equity in storage and information management services businesses operating in
these areas and may acquire other storage and information management services businesses in the future, including in new countries/markets where we currently do not operate.

This
growth strategy involves risks. We may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future at the desired pace or at all. For example, we may be unable
to:

•

identify suitable companies to acquire or invest in;

•

complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms;

•

successfully expand our infrastructure and sales force to support growth;

•

achieve satisfactory returns on acquired companies, particularly in countries where we do not currently operate;

•

incur additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay the purchase price out of working
capital, common stock or other equity securities; or

•

enter into successful business arrangements for technical assistance or management expertise outside of the U.S.

We
also compete with other storage and information management services providers for companies to acquire. Some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources.
If any such competitor were to devote additional resources to pursue such acquisition candidates or focus its strategy on our international markets, the purchase price for potential acquisitions or
investments could rise, competition in international markets could increase and our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Risks Related to Our Common Stock

There is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends.

Our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. However,
our ability to pay dividends will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein occur. In addition, any determination by us to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be
based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements and strategy and our board of directors' continuing determination that the



declaration
of dividends under the dividend policy is in the best interests of our stockholders. The terms of our credit facility and our indentures contain provisions permitting the payment of cash
dividends subject to certain limitations. For these reasons, among others, our cash dividend rate may decline or we may cease paying dividends.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2. Properties.

As of December 31, 2013, we conducted operations through 804 leased facilities and 269 facilities that we own. Our facilities
are divided among our reportable segments as follows: North American Business (686), International Business (386), and Corporate (1). These facilities contain a total of 66.9 million square
feet of space. Facility rent expense was $219.4 million, $224.7 million and $219.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. The leased
facilities typically have initial lease terms of five to ten years with one or more five-year options to extend. In addition, some of the leases contain either a purchase option or a right of first
refusal upon the sale of the property. Our facilities are located throughout North America, Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region, with the largest number of facilities in California,
Florida, New York, New Jersey, Texas, Canada and the United Kingdom. We believe that the space available in our facilities is adequate to meet our current needs, although future growth may require
that we acquire additional real property either by leasing or purchasing. See Note 10 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our minimum annual lease
commitments.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

On November 4, 2011, we experienced a fire at a facility we leased in Aprilia, Italy. The facility primarily stored archival and
inactive business records for local area businesses. Despite quick response by local fire authorities, damage to the building was extensive, and the building and its contents were a total loss. We
continue to assess the impact of the fire, and, although our warehouse legal liability insurer has reserved its rights to contest coverage related to certain types of potential claims, we believe we
carry adequate insurance. We have been sued by three customers, and all three of those matters have been settled. We have also received correspondence from other customers, under various theories of
liabilities. We deny any liability with respect to the fire and we have referred these claims to our warehouse legal liability insurer for an appropriate response. We do not expect that this event
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As discussed in Note 14 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we sold our
Italian operations on April 27, 2012, and we indemnified the buyers related to certain obligations and contingencies associated with the fire.

General

In addition to the matter discussed above, we are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. A
portion of the defense and/or settlement costs associated with such litigation is covered by various commercial liability insurance policies purchased by us and, in limited cases, indemnification from
third parties. In the opinion of management, other than discussed above, no material legal proceedings are pending to which we, or any of our properties, are subject.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.

None.



PART II

On
October 11, 2012, we announced the declaration by our board of directors of a Special Dividend of $700.0 million, payable, at the election of the stockholders, in either
common stock or cash to stockholders of record as of October 22, 2012 (the "Record Date"). The Special Dividend, which is a distribution to stockholders of a portion of our accumulated earnings
and profits, was paid in a combination of common stock and cash. The Special Dividend was paid on November 21, 2012 (the "Distribution Date") to stockholders as of the Record Date. Stockholders
elected to be paid their pro rata portion of the Special Dividend in all common stock or cash. The total amount of cash paid to all stockholders associated with the Special Dividend was approximately
$140.0 million (including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares). Our shares of common stock were valued for purposes of the Special Dividend based upon the average closing price on the three
trading days following November 14, 2012, or $32.87 per share, and as such, the number of shares of common stock we issued in the Special



Dividend
was approximately 17.0 million and the total amount of common stock paid to all stockholders associated with the Special Dividend was approximately $560.0 million. These shares
impact weighted
average shares outstanding from the date of issuance, thus impacting our earnings per share data prospectively from the Distribution Date.

Our
board of directors has authorized up to $1.2 billion in repurchases of our common stock. As of February 7, 2014, we have repurchased approximately $1.1 billion
of our common stock under such authorization. Any determinations by us to repurchase our common stock or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial
condition, results of operations, business requirements, the price of our common stock (in the case of the repurchase program) and our board of directors' continuing determination that the repurchase
program and the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy are in the best interests of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and
dividend programs. The terms of our credit agreement and our indentures contain provisions permitting the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases subject to certain limitations.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

We did not sell any unregistered securities during the three months ended December 31, 2013, nor did we repurchase any shares of
our common stock during the three months ended December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately $66.0 million available for future repurchase under our authorized
stock repurchase program.

Prior
to January 1, 2010, the financial position and results of operations of the operating subsidiaries of Iron Mountain Europe (Group) Limited
(collectively referred to as "IME"), our European business, were consolidated based on IME's fiscal year ended October 31. Effective January 1, 2010, we changed the fiscal year-end (and
the reporting period for consolidation purposes) of IME to coincide with Iron Mountain Incorporated's fiscal year-end of December 31.



We
believe that the change in accounting principle related to the elimination of the two-month reporting lag for IME is preferable because it will result in more contemporaneous reporting of events
and results related to IME. In accordance with applicable accounting literature, a change in subsidiary year-end is treated as a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application.
The impact of the change was not material to the results of operations for the previously reported annual and interim periods after January 1, 2009, and, thus, those results have not been
revised. There is, however, a charge of $4.7 million recorded to other (income) expense, net in the year ended
December 31, 2010 to recognize the immaterial difference arising from the change. There were no significant, infrequent or unusual items in the IME two-month period ended December 31,
2009.

For
the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $85,909 related to our technology escrow services
business, which we continue to own and operate and which was previously reflected in the former worldwide digital business segment and is now reflected as a component of the North American Business
segment. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a $197,876 non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to our former worldwide digital business that is included in loss from
discontinued operations, net of tax. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $46,500 in our Continental Western Europe reporting unit, which
is a component of the International Business segment. See Note 2.g. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
February 2010, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we began paying quarterly dividends on our common stock. See "Item 5.
Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" of this Annual Report.

Adjusted
OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin are non-GAAP measures. Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible
impairments, (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net and REIT Costs. Adjusted OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. For a more
detailed definition and reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA and a discussion of why we believe these non-GAAP measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors, see
"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Measures" of this Annual Report.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" and the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

This
discussion contains "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other securities laws. See "Cautionary Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" on page iii of this Annual Report and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" beginning on page 15 of this Annual Report.

Overview

Potential REIT Conversion

In June 2012, we announced that our board of directors, following a thorough analysis of alternatives and careful consideration of the
topic, and after the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, unanimously approved a plan for us to pursue the Conversion Plan to become a REIT. As part of the Conversion Plan, we are
seeking PLRs from the IRS. The PLR requests have multiple components, and our conversion to a REIT will require favorable rulings from the IRS on a number of technical tax issues, including the
Racking Structure Request.



In June 2013, we disclosed that we had been informed that the IRS had convened an internal working group to study the legal standards the IRS uses to define "real
estate" for purposes of the REIT provisions of the Code and what changes or refinements, if any, should be made to those legal standards. In November 2013, the IRS stated that the working group had
completed its study and that it was resuming issuing rulings regarding the definition of "real estate" for purposes of the REIT provisions of the Code. We are in discussions with the IRS on a number
of our PLR requests, including the Racking Structure Request. As we previously disclosed, the IRS was "tentatively adverse" to providing a PLR that our racking structures constitute real estate for
REIT purposes. At this time, we are not able to predict when the IRS will provide definitive responses to the Racking Structure Request or any additional outstanding PLR requests, and we do not intend
to provide additional interim updates with respect to any of the specific PLR requests or, generally, our progression through the IRS's PLR process.

Even
though we have not yet determined if we will be able to convert to a REIT, we began operating our business in a manner consistent with being a REIT effective January 1, 2014
so that we and our stockholders will benefit from REIT Status in 2014 if we are ultimately successful in becoming a REIT in 2014. Our intended REIT Status may be adversely impacted by concentrated
ownership of our common stock. Therefore, in December 2013, our board of directors approved, and we entered into, a Rights Agreement, which provides for a dividend of a Right for each share of our
Common Stock outstanding on December 20, 2013. Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from us one one-thousandth of a share of our Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for a
purchase price of $114.00, subject to adjustment as provided in the Rights Agreement and our Amended Certificate of Designations for our Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, each of
which was filed with the
SEC on December 9, 2013, on a Current Report on Form 8-K. We anticipate that we will seek stockholder approval to impose ownership limitations in our charter documents, as is customary
for REITs, if we are ultimately successful in converting to a REIT. The Rights Agreement is intended to help protect our potential REIT Status until the approval of those ownership limitations by our
stockholders, or, if earlier, until the Rights expire, which will be no later than December 9, 2014.

If
we are able to convert to, and qualify as, a REIT, we will generally be permitted to deduct from U.S. federal income taxes dividends paid to our stockholders. The income represented
by such dividends would not be subject to U.S. federal taxation at the entity level but would be taxed, if at all, only at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our TRS, which will hold
our U.S. operations that may not be REIT-compliant, would be subject, as applicable, to U.S. federal and state corporate income tax, and we would continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in
non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through qualified REIT subsidiaries or TRS. We would also be subject to a separate
corporate income tax on any gains recognized during a specified period (generally, 10 years) following the REIT conversion that are attributable to "built-in" gains with respect to the assets
that we own on the date we convert to a REIT. Our ability to qualify as a REIT will depend upon our continuing compliance with various requirements following our conversion to a REIT, including
requirements related to the nature of our assets, the sources of our income and the distributions to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at
regular corporate rates. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect
to our TRS operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the U.S. federal income tax regime for REITs described above, many states do not completely follow U.S. federal
rules and some may not follow them at all.

We
currently estimate the operating and capital expenditures associated with the Conversion Plan through the end of 2014 to be approximately $185.0 million to
$200.0 million. Of these amounts, approximately $47.0 million was incurred in 2012, including approximately $12.5 million of capital expenditures. Additionally, approximately
$106.3 million was incurred in 2013, including approximately



$23.4 million
of capital expenditures. If the Conversion Plan is successful, we also expect to incur an additional $10.0 million to $15.0 million in annual REIT compliance costs
in future years.

As
noted, we began operating our business in a manner consistent with being a REIT effective January 1, 2014 so that we and our stockholders will benefit from our REIT Status in
2014 if we are ultimately successful in becoming a REIT for 2014; however, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to elect REIT Status effective January 1, 2014, or at all. As a
calendar year taxpayer, if we are unable to convert to a REIT effective January 1, 2014, the next possible conversion date would be January 1, 2015.

Discontinued Operations

On June 2, 2011, we completed the sale (the "Digital Sale") of our online backup and recovery, digital archiving and eDiscovery
solutions businesses of our Digital Business to Autonomy pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement dated as of May 15, 2011 among IMI, certain subsidiaries of IMI and Autonomy (the "Digital
Sale Agreement"). Additionally, on October 3, 2011, we sold our records management operations in New Zealand. Also, on April 27, 2012, we sold our records management operations in Italy.
The financial position, operating results and cash flows of the Digital Business, our New Zealand operations and our Italian operations, including the gain on the sale of the Digital Business and our
New Zealand operations and the loss on the sale of our Italian operations, for all periods presented, have been reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. See Note 14
to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Restructuring

In the third quarter of 2013, we implemented a plan that calls for certain organizational realignments to advance our growth strategy
and reduce operating costs. As a result, we recorded restructuring costs of approximately $23.4 million in 2013, primarily related to employee severance and associated benefits. Of the total
restructuring costs incurred in 2013, $14.8 million, $3.7 million and $4.9 million are reflected in the results of operations of our North American Business, International
Business and Corporate segments, respectively. In our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2013, $20.0 million and $3.4 million of these
restructuring costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and cost of sales, respectively. We expect to incur an additional $6.9 million of employee severance and
associated benefit costs in 2014 in connection with this organizational realignment primarily in our North American Business segment. As a result of the restructuring of our operations late in 2013
and early in 2014, we are evaluating changes to our internal financial reporting to better align our internal reporting to how we will manage our business going forward. This evaluation could result
in changes to our reportable segments and reporting units during 2014.

General

Our revenues consist of storage rental revenues as well as service revenues. Storage rental revenues, which are considered a key driver
of financial performance for the storage and information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic rental charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on
a per unit basis) that are typically retained by customers for many years. Service revenues include charges for related core service
activities and a wide array of complementary products and services. Included in core service revenues are: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal
of records from storage, refiling of removed records and the destruction of records; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request;
(3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring services, including DMS, which relate to physical and digital records, and recurring project revenues. Our core
service revenue growth has been negatively impacted by declining activity



rates
as stored records are becoming less active. The amount of information available to customers through the Internet or their own information systems has been steadily increasing in recent years.
As a result, while customers continue to store their records with us, they are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records for research purposes, thereby reducing core service
activity levels. While we expect this trend to continue into 2014, the rate of decline in core service activity has begun to moderate in recent periods. Our complementary services revenues include
special project work, customer termination and permanent withdrawal fees, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology services and product sales (including
specially designed storage containers and related supplies). Our secure shredding revenues include the sale of recycled paper (included in complementary services revenues), the price of which can
fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility and reducing the predictability of that revenue stream.

We
recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage rental and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage rental or service is provided, and customers
are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms. Amounts related to future storage rental or prepaid service contracts for customers where storage rental fees or services
are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the period the applicable storage rental or service is provided or performed. Revenues from the sales of
products, which is included as a component of service revenues, is recognized when products are shipped and title has passed to the customer. Revenues from the sales of products have historically not
been significant.

Cost
of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities),
transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most
significant. Trends in total wages and benefits in dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive
compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation. Trends in facility occupancy costs are impacted by the total number of
facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these
properties.

The
expansion of our international and secure shredding businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components. Our international operations are more labor intensive than our
operations in North America and, therefore, labor costs are a higher percentage of segment revenue than our North American operations. Our secure shredding operations incur lower facility costs and
higher transportation costs as a percentage of revenues compared to our core physical businesses.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing
personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wage and benefit dollars as
a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in
costs associated with medical insurance. The overhead structure of our expanding international operations, as compared to our North American operations, is more labor intensive and has not achieved
the same level of overhead leverage, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our international operations become a
more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results.



Our
depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital-intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which
include racking structures, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationship acquisition costs and is
impacted by the nature and timing of acquisitions.

Our
consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the
U.S. It is difficult to predict the future fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and how those fluctuations will impact our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Due to the expansion of our
international operations, some of these fluctuations have become material on individual balances. However, because both the revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency of the country
in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income and operating margin is partially mitigated. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our
underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percentage change in the results from one period to another period in this report using constant
currency presentation. The constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2011 results at the 2012 average exchange rates and the 2012 results at the 2013 average exchange rates.

The
following table is a comparison of underlying average exchange rates of the foreign currencies that had the most significant impact on our U.S. dollar-reported revenues and expenses:

Non-GAAP Measures

Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation, Amortization, Intangible Impairments and REIT Costs ("Adjusted OIBDA")

Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments, (gain) loss on
disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net, and REIT Costs. Adjusted OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. We use multiples of current or projected
Adjusted OIBDA in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA
Margin provide our current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding our ability to generate cash flow to support business investment. These measures are an integral part
of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. Adjusted OIBDA does not include certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core
operating results, specifically: (1) (gain) loss on disposal/



write-down
of property, plant and equipment, net; (2) intangible impairments; (3) REIT Costs; (4) other expense (income), net; (5) income (loss) from discontinued
operations, net of tax; (6) gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax and (7) net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Adjusted
OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision (benefit) for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which
we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, Adjusted OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact
of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin should be
considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America
("GAAP"), such as operating or net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP).

Adjusted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations ("Adjusted EPS")

Adjusted EPS is defined as reported earnings per share from continuing operations excluding: (1) (gain) loss on
disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net; (2) intangible impairments; (3) REIT Costs; (4) other expense (income), net; and (5) the tax impact of
reconciling items and discrete tax items. We do not believe these excluded items to be indicative of our ongoing operating results, and they are not considered when we are forecasting our future
results. We believe Adjusted EPS is of value to our current and potential investors when comparing our results from past, present and future periods.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate
the estimates used. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order:

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues consist of storage rental revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes.
Storage rental revenues, which are considered a key driver of financial performance for the storage and information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic rental charges
related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis). Service revenues include charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and
services. Included in core service revenues are: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records and
the destruction of records; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and
(4) other recurring services, including DMS, which relate to physical and digital records, and recurring project revenues. Our complementary services revenues include special project work,
customer termination and permanent withdrawal fees, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage
containers and related supplies). Our secure shredding revenues include the sale of recycled paper (included in complementary services revenues), the price of which can fluctuate from period to
period, adding to the volatility and reducing the predictability of that revenue stream.

We
recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage rental and service revenues are recognized in the



month
the respective storage rental or service is provided, and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms. Amounts related to future storage rental or
prepaid service contracts for customers where storage rental fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the period the applicable storage
rental or service is provided or performed. Revenues from the sales of products, which is included as a component of service revenues, is recognized when products are shipped and title has passed to
the customer. Revenues from the sales of products have historically not been significant.

Accounting for Acquisitions

Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition by us of numerous businesses. The purchase price of each acquisition has been
determined after due diligence of the target business, market research, strategic planning and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies
are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources.

Each
acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition. Accounting for
these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the
assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment based on the final assessments of the fair value of intangible assets (primarily
customer relationship assets), property, plant and equipment (primarily racking structures), operating leases, contingencies and income taxes (primarily deferred income taxes). We complete these
assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent acquisitions.

Determining
the fair values of the net assets acquired requires management's judgment and often involves the use of assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount
rates and market data, among other items. Due to the inherent uncertainty of future events, actual values of net assets acquired could be different from our estimated fair values and could have a
material impact on our financial statements.

Of
the net assets acquired in our acquisitions, the fair value of owned buildings, customer relationship intangible assets, racking structures and operating leases are generally the most
common and most significant. For significant acquisitions or acquisitions involving new markets or new products, we
generally use third party appraisals of the fair value of owned buildings, customer relationship intangible assets and market rental rates for acquired operating leases. For acquisitions that are not
significant or do not involve new markets or new products, we generally use third party appraisals of fair value for acquired owned buildings and market rental rates for acquired operating leases.
When not using third party appraisals of the fair value of acquired net assets, the fair value of acquired customer relationship intangible assets and acquired racking structures is determined
internally. The fair value of acquired racking structures is determined internally by taking current replacement cost at the date of acquisition for the quantity of racking structures acquired
discounted to take into account the quality (e.g. age, material and type) of the racking structures. Additionally, we use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of customer
relationship intangible assets, which requires a significant amount of judgment by management, including estimating expected lives of the relationships, expected future cash flows and discount rates.

Of
the key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values of customer relationship intangible assets, the expected future cash flows and discount rate are among the most sensitive and
are considered to be critical assumptions. To illustrate the sensitivity of changes in key assumptions used in determining the fair value of customer relationship intangible assets acquired in our
most significant



acquisition
in fiscal year 2013, of Cornerstone, a hypothetical increase of 10% in the expected annual future cash flows, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have increased the calculated fair
value of the acquired customer relationship intangible assets by $11.2 million, with an offsetting decrease to goodwill. A hypothetical decrease of 100 basis points in the discount rate, with
all other assumptions unchanged, would have increased the fair value of the acquired customer relationship intangible assets by $8.7 million, with an offsetting decrease to goodwill.

Our
estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or
inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy of such assumptions.

Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets

Assets subject to depreciation or amortization:

We review long-lived assets and all
amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Examples of events or circumstances that
may be indicative of impairment include, but are not limited to:

•

A significant decrease in the market price of an asset;

•

A significant change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;

•

A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset;

•

An accumulation of costs significantly greater than the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of
an asset; and

•

A current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the
end of its previously estimated useful life.

Recoverability
of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations
are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then
intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long-lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values,
depending upon the nature of the assets.

Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization:

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are
reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill
impairment review as of October 1, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and noted no impairment of goodwill at those dates. However, as a result of interim triggering events as discussed below, we recorded a
provisional goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2011 in conjunction with our European operations. This provisional goodwill impairment charge was finalized in the fourth quarter of
2011. As of December 31, 2013, no factors were identified that would alter our October 1, 2013 goodwill assessment. In making this assessment, we relied on a number of factors including
operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and marketplace
data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting
units, the goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values.

In
September 2011, as a result of certain changes we made in the manner in which our European operations are managed, we reorganized our reporting structure and reassigned goodwill among
the



revised
reporting units. Previously, we tested goodwill impairment at the European level on a combined basis. As a result of the management and reporting changes, we concluded at that time that we had
three reporting units within our European operations: (1) United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway ("UKI"); (2) Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain ("Continental
Western Europe"); and (3) the remaining countries in Europe ("Central Europe"). As a result of the restructuring of our reporting units, we concluded that we had an interim triggering event,
and, therefore, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for UKI, Continental Western Europe and Central Europe in the third quarter of 2011, as of August 31, 2011. As required by GAAP,
prior to our goodwill impairment analysis, we performed an impairment assessment on the long-lived assets within our UKI, Continental Western Europe and Central Europe reporting units and noted no
impairment, except for our Italian operations, which was included in our Continental Western Europe reporting unit, and which is now included in discontinued operations as discussed in Note 14.
Based on our analysis, we concluded that the goodwill of our UKI and Central Europe reporting units was not impaired. Our Continental Western Europe reporting unit's fair value was less than its
carrying value, and, as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $46.5 million included as a component of intangible impairments from continuing operations in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Our
reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2011 were as follows: (1) North America; (2) UKI;
(3) Continental Western Europe; (4) Central Europe; (5) Latin America; (6) Australia; and (7) our China, Hong Kong, India, Russia, Singapore and Ukraine joint
ventures (collectively, "Worldwide Joint Ventures"). As of December 31, 2011, the carrying value of goodwill, net amounted to $1,748.9 million, $306.2 million,
$46.4 million, $63.8 million, $27.3 million and $61.7 million for North America, UKI, Continental Western Europe, Central Europe, Latin America and Australia, respectively.
Our Worldwide Joint Ventures reporting unit had no goodwill as of December 31, 2011.

In
2012, we reorganized the management and reporting structure of our international operations. As a result of the management and reporting changes, we concluded that we have the
following six reporting units: (1) North America; (2) United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain ("Western Europe"); (3) the
remaining countries in Europe in which we operate, excluding Russia and the Ukraine ("Emerging Markets"); (4) Latin America; (5) Australia, China, Hong Kong and Singapore ("Asia
Pacific"); and (6) India, Russia and the Ukraine
("Emerging Market Joint Ventures"). As of December 31, 2012, the carrying value of goodwill, net amounted to $1,762.3 million, $365.3 million, $87.5 million,
$56.9 million and $62.8 million for North America, Western Europe, Emerging Markets, Latin America and Asia Pacific, respectively. Our Emerging Market Joint Ventures reporting unit had
no goodwill as of December 31, 2012 and 2013. As of December 31, 2013, the carrying value of goodwill, net amounted to $1,849.4 million, $376.0 million,
$88.6 million, $93.2 million and $56.2 million for North America, Western Europe, Emerging Markets, Latin America and Asia Pacific, respectively. Based on our goodwill impairment
assessment, all of our reporting units with goodwill had estimated fair values as of October 1, 2013 that exceeded their carrying values by greater than 15%.

Reporting
unit valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit or a combined approach based on the present
value of future cash flows and market and transaction multiples of revenues and earnings. The income approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected
capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. In conjunction with our
annual goodwill impairment reviews, we reconcile the sum of the valuations of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of such dates.



Although
we believe we have sufficient historical and projected information available to us to test for impairment, it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates
used in our impairment tests. Of the key assumptions that impact the goodwill impairment test, the expected future cash flows and discount rate are among the most sensitive and are considered to be
critical assumptions and changes to these estimates could have an effect on the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units. As a measure of sensitivity of the amount of potential goodwill
impairment charges to changes in key assumptions we have grouped each of our reporting units according to the amount by which each reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value in the
goodwill impairment test. A hypothetical decrease of 10% in the expected annual future cash flows, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have decreased the fair value of our reporting units by
approximately 4.1% to 10.0% but would not, however, have resulted in the carrying value of any of our reporting units with goodwill exceeding their fair value. A hypothetical increase of 100 basis
points in the discount rate, with all other assumptions unchanged, would have decreased the fair value of our reporting units by approximately 5.0% to 13.5% but would not, however, have resulted in
the carrying value of any of our reporting units with goodwill exceeding their fair value.

Income Taxes

We have a valuation allowance, amounting to $40.3 million as of December 31, 2013, reducing our deferred tax assets,
primarily associated with certain foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards, to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have federal net operating loss carryforwards, which
expire in 2021 through 2033, of $70.3 million ($24.6 million, tax effected) at December 31, 2013 to reduce future federal taxable income. We have assets for state net operating
losses of $2.7 million (net of federal tax benefit), which expire in 2014 through 2025, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 45%. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of
$53.8 million, with various expiration dates (and in some cases no expiration date), subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 72%. We also have foreign tax credits of
$10.2 million, which will begin to expire in 2024. If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income
tax assets and foreign tax credit carryforwards, and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates
reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such
determination is made.

The
evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a measurement process whereby
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the
largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

We
are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have business
operations or a taxable presence. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2012 and 2013,
we had approximately $37.6 million and $51.1 million, respectively, of reserves related to uncertain tax positions. The reversal of these reserves will be recorded as a reduction of our
income tax provision if sustained. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates.

After
the repatriation discussed in Note 7 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have a net tax over book outside basis difference related to our foreign subsidiaries.
We do not expect this



net
basis difference to reverse in the foreseeable future and we intend to reinvest any future undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the U.S. We have instances
where we have book over tax outside basis differences for certain foreign subsidiaries. These basis differences arose primarily through undistributed book earnings of such foreign subsidiaries of
$52.1 million and could be reversed through a sale of such foreign subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from such subsidiaries or certain other events or actions on our part, each of which
would result in an increase in our provision for income taxes. It is not practicable to calculate the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these book over tax outside basis differences
because of the complexities of the hypothetical calculation. We may record additional deferred taxes on book over tax outside basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries in the future
depending upon a number of factors, decisions and events in connection with our potential conversion to a REIT, including favorable indications from the IRS with regard to our PLR requests,
finalization of countries to be included in our plan to convert to a REIT, shareholder approval of certain modifications to our corporate charter and final board of director approval of our conversion
to a REIT.

Constant
currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2012 results at the 2013 average exchange rates and the 2011 results at the 2012 average
exchange rates.

(2)

Our
internal revenue growth rate represents the weighted average year-over-year growth rate of our revenues after removing the effects of acquisitions,
divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations.

Our
consolidated storage rental revenues increased $51.6 million, or 3.0%, to $1,784.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $50.1 million, or
3.0%, to $1,733.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The growth rate for the year ended
December 31, 2013 consists primarily of internal revenue growth of 2.1%. Net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 1.5% of the increase in reported storage rental revenues in 2013 over 2012.
Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our storage rental revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately 0.6%. Our consolidated storage rental revenue
growth in 2013 was driven by sustained storage rental internal growth of 0.8% and 6.2% in our North American Business and International Business segments, respectively. Global records management net
volumes in 2013 increased by 5.8% over the ending volume at December 31, 2012, supported by strong international volume growth of 12.2%, primarily driven by solid increases from emerging
markets in central Europe and Latin America, and recently completed acquisitions in Brazil, Colombia and Peru. The growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 consists of internal revenue
growth of 3.0%. Net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 1.3% of the increase in reported storage rental revenues in 2012 over 2011. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our storage
rental revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 by approximately 1.4%. Our consolidated storage rental revenue growth in 2012 was driven by sustained storage rental internal
growth of 2.1% and 6.1% in our North American Business and International Business segments, respectively.

Consolidated
service revenues, consisting of core and complementary services, decreased $30.9 million, or 2.4%, to $1,241.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2013 from $1,272.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Service revenue internal growth was negative 3.4% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The negative service
revenue internal growth for 2013 was primarily driven by negative core service internal growth of 3.1% which reflects a trend toward reduced retrieval/re-file activity and the related transportation
revenues, as well as lower shredding revenues within our International Business segment. Negative complementary service revenue internal growth of 4.3% in 2013 compared to the same period last year
was primarily due to lower termination fees and fulfillment revenues, partially offset by solid growth in DMS and increased special records management project volume. Shredding volumes increased
slightly in the North American Business segment but were offset by lower volume in our International Business segment due to the loss of certain accounts in the prior year and lower recycled paper
pricing when compared to prior year averages. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased reported service revenues by 0.8% in 2013 over 2012. Offsetting



the
decrease in reported consolidated service revenues were net acquisitions/divestitures, which contributed an increase of 1.8% of total reported service revenues in 2013. Consolidated service
revenues, consisting of core and complementary services, decreased $59.6 million, or 4.5%, to $1,272.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 from $1,331.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2011. Service revenue internal growth was negative 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2012. The negative service revenue internal growth for 2012 was
driven by negative complementary service revenue internal growth of 9.6% due primarily to the significant decrease in recycled paper prices in 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, which resulted
in $30.0 million less of recycled paper revenue. This decline was partially offset by strong DMS revenue growth and increased project revenues in 2012. Core service internal growth in 2012 was
negative 2.5% due to expected declines in activity-based core services, particularly in the North American Business segment. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased reported service
revenues by 1.4% in 2012 over 2011. Offsetting the decrease in reported service revenues were net acquisitions/divestures, which contributed 1.4% to our service revenues in 2012.

For
the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $20.7 million, or 0.7%, to $3,025.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 from
$3,005.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Internal revenue growth was negative 0.2% for 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2013, foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations decreased our consolidated revenues by 0.7% primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling and Canadian dollar, and offset by an increase of the Euro against the U.S.
dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Offsetting the decrease in reported consolidated revenues were net acquisitions/divestitures, which contributed an
increase of 1.6% of total reported revenues in 2013 over the same period in 2012. Our consolidated revenues decreased $9.4 million, or 0.3%, to $3,005.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2012 from $3,014.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Internal revenue growth was negative 0.3% for 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2012,
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our consolidated revenues by 1.4% primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S. dollar,
based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Offsetting the decrease in reported consolidated revenues were net acquisitions/divestitures which contributed an increase of
1.3% of total reported revenues in 2012 over the same period in 2011.

We
expect our consolidated internal revenue growth rate for 2014 to be approximately 0% to 2%. During the past eight quarters our storage rental revenue internal growth rate has ranged
between 1.3% and 3.5%. Storage rental revenue internal growth rates have been stable over the past eight quarters. Volume growth in the North American Business segment has been relatively flat over
this period, and, as a result, storage rental growth has been driven primarily by net price increases. Within our International Business segment, the developed markets are generating consistent
low-to-mid single-digit storage rental growth while the emerging markets are producing strong double-digit storage rental growth by capturing the first-time outsourcing trends for physical records
storage and management in those markets. The internal revenue growth rate for service revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage rental revenue internal growth rate due to the more
discretionary nature of certain complementary services we offer, such as large special projects, and, as a commodity, the volatility of



pricing
for recycled paper. These revenues, which are often event-driven and impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of certain services as a way
to reduce their short-term costs, may be difficult to replicate in future periods. The internal growth rate for total service revenues reflects the following: (1) consistent pressures on
activity-based service revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage and secure shredding, particularly in the North American Business segment; and (2) softness in
some of our other complementary service lines, such as fulfillment services.

Labor

Labor expense increased to 21.1% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 20.8% for the year
ended December 31, 2012. Labor expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by 3.1% on a constant currency basis compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily
due to $10.7 million of incremental labor costs associated with fiscal year 2013 acquisitions, as well as $3.4 million of restructuring costs that were incurred in 2013. Labor costs were
favorably impacted by 1.1 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2013.

Labor
expense increased to 20.8% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 19.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011. Labor expense for the
year ended December 31, 2012 increased by 6.8% on a constant currency basis compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily due to merit increases, the reclassification of certain
overhead expenses to cost of sales, and $12.9 million in labor costs associated with our recent acquisitions. Labor costs were favorably impacted by 1.6 percentage points due to currency
rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2012.



Facilities

Facilities costs decreased to 13.7% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to 14.0% in the
comparable prior year period. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which, in constant currency terms, decreased by $6.0 million to $205.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period of 2012 as a result of our ongoing facility consolidation efforts. This decrease was partially offset by $4.8 million of costs
associated with 2013 acquisitions. Facilities costs were favorably impacted by 0.9 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2013.

Facilities
costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues were flat at 14.0% for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Rent expense increased by
$6.5 million to $213.8 million in constant currency terms for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to $3.4 million of rent
expense associated with our acquisitions, as well as certain facility consolidations within both our North American Business and International Business segments during the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 2012. Other facilities costs decreased by approximately $2.2 million, in constant currency terms, for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31,
2011, primarily due to reductions in insurance costs and personal property taxes. Facilities
costs were favorably impacted by 1.4 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2012.

Transportation

Transportation expenses decreased by $1.4 million in constant currency terms during the year ended December 31, 2013
compared to the same period in 2012 as a result of a decrease in vehicle lease expense, primarily associated with our United Kingdom operations, due to the capitalization of leased vehicles upon
renewal. The lease cost did not change, but the categorization of charges did, resulting in the cost now being allocated to depreciation and interest. Transportation expenses were favorably impacted
by 1.2 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2013.

Transportation
expenses increased by $2.9 million in constant currency terms during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 as a result of a
$3.5 million increase in various vehicle costs (including fuel, insurance, repair and lease costs), partially offset by a reduction in third-party transportation costs of $0.4 million.
Transportation expenses were favorably impacted by 1.6 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2012.

Product Cost of Sales and Other

Product cost of sales and other, which includes cartons, media and other service, storage and supply costs, is highly correlated to
complementary revenue streams, particularly project revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2013, product cost of sales and other increased by $9.6 million compared to the prior year
on an actual basis, primarily as a result of higher move costs associated with facility consolidations, as well as $1.5 million of incremental costs incurred associated with 2013 acquisitions.
These costs were favorably impacted by 1.0 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2013.

For
the year ended December 31, 2012, product cost of sales and other increased by $1.1 million as compared to the prior year period on an actual basis. These costs were
favorably impacted by 1.9 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2012.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses increased to 19.7% of consolidated revenues during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared
to 16.9% in the year ended December 31, 2012. In constant currency terms, general and administrative expenses increased by $91.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2013
compared to the same period in 2012. Included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $82.9 million of REIT Costs, compared to
$34.4 million in the comparable prior year period. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 also included a $31.7 million increase
in compensation expenses, primarily associated with restructuring costs, $5.1 million of incremental costs associated with 2013 acquisitions and a $4.8 million increase in software
license fees. General and administrative expenses were favorably impacted by 0.8 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2013.

General
and administrative expenses increased to 16.9% of consolidated revenues in the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 15.6% in the year ended December 31, 2011.
In constant currency terms, general and administrative expenses increased by 9.5% during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. Included in general and
administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $34.4 million of REIT Costs compared to $15.5 million in the comparable prior year period. Further contributing
to the increase in 2012 was increased stock-based compensation expense of $10.6 million and a $7.4 million increase within our Latin American operations primarily associated with our
2012 acquisition in Brazil. These increases were partially offset by the reclassification of certain overhead expenses to cost of sales. General and administrative expenses were favorably impacted by
1.4 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2012.



Sales, Marketing & Account Management

Sales, marketing and account management expenses decreased to 7.2% of consolidated revenues during the year ended December 31,
2013 compared to 7.8% in the comparable prior year period. In constant currency terms, the decrease of $14.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period
in 2012 is due to a $18.5 million decrease in compensation expense within our North American Business segment, primarily as a result of restructuring in the fourth quarter of 2012. This
decrease was partially offset by $1.1 million of
incremental costs incurred associated with 2013 acquisitions. Sales, marketing and account management expenses were favorably impacted by 0.6 percentage points due to currency rate changes
during the year ended December 31, 2013.

Sales,
marketing and account management expenses decreased to 7.8% of consolidated revenues during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 8.1% in the same prior year period.
In constant currency terms, the decrease of $6.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 is primarily due to a $3.0 million reduction
in compensation expenses, primarily associated with a decrease in commission expense within our North American Business segment, as well as a corresponding decrease in the associated payroll taxes.
Sales, marketing and account management expenses were favorably impacted by 1.2 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2012. These decreases
were partially offset by restructuring costs of $3.6 million incurred within our North American Business segment during the fourth quarter of 2012.

Information Technology

In constant currency terms, information technology expenses increased $0.4 million during the year ended December 31,
2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to incremental costs associated with 2013 acquisitions. Information technology expenses were favorably impacted by 0.8 percentage points
due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2013.

In
constant currency terms, information technology expenses decreased $10.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily
due to decreased compensation expenses of $8.2 million, as well as decreased professional fees of $2.6 million. Information technology expenses were favorably impacted by
1.4 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2012.

Bad Debt Expense

Consolidated bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $3.0 million, or 35.9%, to
$11.3 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) from $8.3 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2012. We maintain an allowance for doubtful
accounts that is calculated based on our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable
balances. We continue to monitor our customers' payment activity and make adjustments based on their financial condition and in light of historical and expected trends.

Consolidated
bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased $1.2 million, or 12.4%, to $8.3 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues) from
$9.5 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) Loss on Disposal/Write-down of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Depreciation expense increased $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2012, primarily due to the increased depreciation of property, plant and



equipment
acquired through business combinations. Depreciation expense decreased $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011,
consisting of $2.1 million within our North American Business and Corporate segments associated with information technology assets reaching the end of their useful life and $7.9 million
in our International Business segment primarily related to accelerated depreciation taken in previous years due to the decision to exit certain facilities in the United Kingdom.

Amortization
expense increased $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 and increased $6.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due, in each year, to the increased amortization of customer relationship intangible assets
acquired through business combinations.

Consolidated
gain on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and consisted primarily of gains on the
retirement of leased vehicles accounted for as capital lease assets associated with our North American Business segment of $2.5 million and the sale of two buildings in the United Kingdom of
$1.8 million, partially offset by approximately $2.0 million of asset write-offs in North America and approximately $0.9 million of asset write-offs associated with our European
operations. Consolidated loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net was $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 and consisted primarily of
$5.5 million, $1.9 million and $0.5 million of losses associated with asset write-downs in our European operations, North American operations and Latin American operations,
respectively, offset by $3.5 million of gains associated with the sale of leased vehicles in North America. Consolidated gain on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net of
$2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 consisted primarily of (1) a gain of approximately $3.2 million related to the
disposition of a facility in Canada and (2) a gain of approximately $3.0 million on the retirement of leased vehicles accounted for as capital lease assets in North America, offset by
(3) a loss associated with discontinued use of certain third-party software licenses of approximately $3.5 million (approximately $3.1 million associated with our International
Business segment and approximately $0.4 million associated with our North American Business segment).

Intangible Impairments

In September 2011, as a result of certain changes we made in the manner in which our European operations are managed, we reorganized
our reporting structure and reassigned goodwill among the revised reporting units. As a result of the management and reporting changes, we concluded at that time that we had three reporting units
within our European operations: (1) UKI; (2) Continental Western Europe; and (3) Central Europe. As a result of the restructuring of our reporting units, we concluded that we had
an interim triggering event, and, therefore, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for UKI, Continental Western Europe and Central Europe in the third quarter of 2011, as of
August 31, 2011. As required by GAAP, prior to our goodwill impairment analysis, we performed an impairment assessment on the long-lived assets within our UKI, Continental Western Europe and
Central Europe reporting units and noted no impairment, except for our Italian operations, which was included in our Continental Western Europe reporting unit, and which is now included in
discontinued operations. Based on our analyses, we concluded that the goodwill of our UKI and Central Europe reporting units was not impaired. Our Continental Western Europe reporting unit's fair
value was less than its carrying value, and, as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $46.5 million included as a component of intangible impairments from continuing operations
in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011.



OPERATING INCOME and ADJUSTED OIBDA

As a result of the foregoing factors: (1) consolidated operating income decreased $64.6 million, or 11.6%, to
$492.4 million (16.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2013 from $557.0 million (18.5% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31,
2012; (2) consolidated Adjusted OIBDA decreased $16.3 million, or 1.8%, to $895.9 million (29.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2013 from
$912.2 million (30.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2012; (3) consolidated operating income decreased $14.2 million, or 2.5%, to
$557.0 million (18.5% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2012 from $571.2 million (18.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31,
2011 and (4) consolidated Adjusted OIBDA decreased $38.2 million, or 4.0%, to $912.2 million (30.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2012 from
$950.4 million (31.5% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Interest Expense, Net

Consolidated interest expense, net increased $11.6 million to $254.2 million (8.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year
ended December 31, 2013 from $242.6 million (8.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to the issuance of $600.0 million in
aggregate principal of the 6% Senior Notes due 2023 (the "6% Notes") by IMI in August 2013, the issuance of 200.0 million CAD in aggregate principal of the 6

% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024 (the "5

Net
foreign currency transaction losses of $36.2 million, based on period-end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2013. Losses resulted primarily
from changes in the exchange rate of each of the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Russian ruble and Euro against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2012, as these currencies relate to
our intercompany balances with and between our European, Australian and Brazilian subsidiaries as well as British pound sterling debt and forward currency contracts, which were partially offset by
gains as a result of an Australian forward currency contract, as well as changes in the exchange rate of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2012 as it
relates to our intercompany balances with and between our United Kingdom subsidiaries.

Net
foreign currency transaction losses of $10.2 million, based on period-end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2012. Losses were primarily a
result of changes in the exchange rate of the Brazilian real, as this currency relates to our intercompany balances with and between our Brazilian subsidiaries, as well as additional losses associated
with our British pound sterling and Euro denominated debt and forward foreign currency swap contracts denominated in British pounds sterling and Australian dollars. These losses were partially offset
by gains resulting primarily from the change in the exchange rate of the British pound sterling, Euro and Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2011, as it relates
to our intercompany balances with and between our European and Australian subsidiaries.

Net
foreign currency transaction losses of $17.4 million, based on period-end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2011. Losses were primarily a
result of British pound sterling denominated debt and forward foreign currency swap contracts and changes in the exchange rate of the Euro, Russian Ruble and certain Latin American currencies against
the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2010, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our European and Latin American subsidiaries. Partially offsetting these
losses were gains which resulted primarily from our Euro denominated bonds issued by IMI as well as changes in the exchange rate of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar compared to
December 31, 2010, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our United Kingdom subsidiaries.

During
the year ended December 31, 2013 we recorded a charge of $43.7 million related to the amendment of our revolving credit and term loan facilities in the third quarter
of 2013, representing a write-off of deferred financing costs, and the early extinguishment of the Senior Subordinated Subsidiary Notes, the 8% Notes, the 8% Notes due 2020 and a portion of the


/


% Notes. This charge



consists
of call premiums, original issue discounts and deferred financing costs related to this debt. During the year ended December 31, 2012 we recorded a charge of approximately
$10.6 million related to the early extinguishment of $320.0 million of the 6


/


% Notes and $200.0 million of the 8


/


% Notes in the third quarter of
2012. This charge consists of the call premium associated with the 8


/


% Notes and original issue discounts and deferred financing costs related to the 6


/


% Notes and


/


% Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2011 we recorded a gain of approximately $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2011 related to the early extinguishment of
$231.3 million of the 7


/


% Notes due 2015. This gain consists of original issue premiums, net of deferred financing costs related to the 7


/


% Notes due 2015.
Additionally, we recorded a charge of $1.8 million in the second quarter of 2011 related to the early retirement of our previous revolving credit and term loan facilities, representing a
write-off of deferred financing costs.

Other,
net in the year ended December 31, 2013 consists primarily of $3.7 million of royalty income associated with the Digital Business. Other, net in the year ended
December 31, 2012 consists primarily of $2.7 million of royalty income associated with the Digital Business, $1.5 million of gains associated with our acquisition of equity
interests that we previously held associated with our Turkish and Swiss joint ventures and $1.3 million of gains related to certain marketable securities held in a trust for the benefit of
employees participating in a deferred compensation plan we sponsor. Other, net for the year ended December 31, 2011 was a gain of $5.3 million, which primarily consists of a
$5.9 million gain associated with the fair valuing of the 20% equity interest that we previously held in our Polish joint venture in connection with our acquisition of the remaining 80%
interest in January 2011.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 were 30.2%, 38.5% and 38.7%, respectively. The
primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 were the impact from the repatriation discussed
below, which increased our 2013 effective tax rate by 13.1%, and state income taxes (net of federal tax benefit). These expenses were partially offset by a favorable impact provided by the recognition
of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits due to expirations of statute of limitation periods and settlements with tax authorities in various jurisdictions and differences in the rates of tax at
which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory
rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 were differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange
gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates and state income taxes (net of federal tax benefit). During the year ended December 31, 2012, foreign currency gains were
recorded in lower tax jurisdictions associated with our marking-to-market of intercompany loan positions while foreign currency losses were recorded in higher tax jurisdictions associated with our
marking-to-market of debt and derivative instruments, which lowered our 2012 effective tax rate by 2.2%. The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall
effective tax rate for the year ended
December 31, 2011 was a favorable impact provided by the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits due to expirations of statute of limitation periods and settlements with tax
authorities in various jurisdictions and differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with
different tax rates. This benefit was partially offset by state income taxes (net of federal benefit). Additionally, to a lesser extent, a goodwill impairment charge included in income from continuing
operations as a component of intangible impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, of which a majority was non-deductible for tax purposes, is a reconciling item that impacts our
effective tax rate.

During
2013, we completed a plan to utilize both current and carryforward foreign tax credits by repatriating approximately $252.7 million (approximately $65.2 million of
which was previously subject



to
U.S. taxes) from our foreign earnings. Due to uncertainty in our ability to fully utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards, we previously did not recognize a full benefit for such foreign tax
credit carryforwards in our tax provision. As a result, we recorded an increase in our tax provision from continuing operations in the amount of approximately $63.5 million in 2013. This
increase was offset by decreases of approximately $18.8 million from current year foreign tax credits and approximately $23.3 million reversal of valuation allowances related to foreign
tax credit carryforwards, resulting in a net increase of approximately $21.4 million in our tax provision from continuing operations.

Our
effective tax rate is subject to variability in the future due to, among other items: (1) changes in the mix of income from foreign jurisdictions; (2) tax law changes;
(3) volatility in foreign exchange gains (losses); (4) the timing of the establishment and reversal of tax reserves; (5) our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and net
operating losses that we generate; and (6) our proposed REIT conversion. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various
tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these
matters as appropriate. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates.

INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013
decreased $83.5 million, or 45.5%, to $100.0 million (3.3% of consolidated revenues) from income from continuing operations of $183.5 million (6.1% of consolidated revenues) for
the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in income from continuing
operations is primarily due to a $48.4 million increase in REIT Costs year over year, restructuring costs of $23.4 million and a $59.1 million increase in other expenses primarily
associated with debt extinguishment costs and foreign exchange losses, partially offset by a lower income tax provision in 2013 compared to 2012.

As
a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased $62.9 million, or 25.5%, to
$183.5 million (6.1% of consolidated revenues) from income from continuing operations of $246.4 million (8.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011. The
decrease in income from continuing operations is primarily due to the $37.3 million increase in interest expense, an $18.9 million increase in REIT Costs year over year, and a higher
income tax provision in 2012 compared to 2011.

INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX

(Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax was $(47.4) million, $(6.8) million and $0.8 million for the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. During 2011, we recorded an impairment charge of $4.9 million to write-down the long-lived assets of our New Zealand operations to its
estimated net realizable value, which is included in loss from discontinued operations. Additionally, we recorded a tax benefit of $7.9 million during 2011 associated with the outside tax basis
of our New Zealand operations, which is also reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations. Additionally, in conjunction with the goodwill impairment analysis performed associated with our
Continental Western Europe reporting unit, we performed an impairment test on the long-lived assets of our Italian operations in the third quarter of 2011. The undiscounted cash flows from our Italian
operations were lower than the carrying value of the long-lived assets of such operations and resulted in the requirement to fair value the long-lived assets of this lower level component. As a
result, we recorded write-offs of other intangible assets, primarily customer relationship values of $8.0 million, and certain write-downs to property, plant and equipment (primarily racking
structures) long-lived assets in Italy of $6.6 million in the third quarter of 2011, which are included in loss from discontinued operations. We allocated $2.5 million of the Continental
Western Europe goodwill impairment charge



to
our Italian operations which is included in loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the income from
discontinued operations, net of tax primarily represents the recovery of insurance proceeds in excess of carrying value associated with our Italian operations.

Pursuant
to the Digital Sale Agreement, we received approximately $395.4 million in cash, consisting of the initial purchase price and a working capital adjustment. Transaction
costs relating to the Digital Sale amounted to approximately $7.4 million. Additionally, $11.1 million of inducements payable to Autonomy have been netted against the proceeds in
calculating the gain on the Digital Sale. Also, a tax provision of $45.1 million associated with the gain recorded on the Digital Sale was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2011.
A gain on sale of discontinued operations in the amount of $243.9 million ($198.7 million, net of tax) was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2011, as a result of the
Digital Sale. We sold our New Zealand operations on October 3, 2011 and recorded a gain on the sale of discontinued operations of approximately $1.9 million during the fourth quarter of
2011. We recorded a loss on sale of discontinued operations in the amount of $1.9 million ($1.9 million, net of tax) during the year ended December 31, 2012 as a result of the
sale of our Italian operations.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in a decrease in net income attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated of
$3.5 million, $3.1 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These amounts represent our noncontrolling partners' share
of earnings/losses in our majority-owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results.

See
Note 9 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the definition of Adjusted OIBDA and for the basis on which allocations are made and
a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to operating income.

During
the year ended December 31, 2013, revenue in our North American Business segment decreased 0.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to
negative internal growth of 1.5%. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the negative internal growth was primarily driven by negative consolidated service internal growth of 4.6%, which was the
result of a trend toward reduced retrieval/re-file activity and the related transportation revenues, partially offset by storage rental revenue internal growth of 0.8% in the year ended
December 31, 2013 primarily related to net price increases. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue declined 110 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to
the same period of 2012, primarily due to restructuring charges and costs associated with the decision to discontinue work on a data archiving solution recorded in 2013, partially offset by a decrease
in compensation expense as a result of restructuring in sales, marketing and account management in the fourth quarter of 2012.

During
the year ended December 31, 2012, revenue in our North American Business segment decreased 1.4% compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to
negative internal growth of 1.3%. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the negative internal growth was driven by negative complementary service revenue internal growth of 12.0% due primarily
to a decrease in the price of recycled paper and by negative core service internal growth of 3.1%, which was primarily a result of lower revenues from activity-based services. Partially offsetting the
negative service growth was storage rental revenue internal growth of 2.1% in the year ended December 31, 2012, as a result of net price increases. Additionally, unfavorable foreign currency
rate changes related to the Canadian dollar resulted in decreased reported revenues, as measured in U.S. dollars, of 0.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2012. Adjusted OIBDA, as a percentage of segment revenue, decreased by 150 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily as
a result of the decrease in recycled paper revenue as well as $6.3 million of certain costs that were reclassified into the North American Business segment from the Corporate segment in fiscal
year 2012.

Reported
revenues in our International Business segment increased 4.8% during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Internal growth
for the year ended December 31, 2013 was 3.2%, supported by solid 6.2% storage rental internal growth, partially offset by negative total service internal growth of 0.5% driven by lower
shredding revenues. Acquisitions contributed 3.6% to total reported revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2013. Foreign currency fluctuations in 2013, primarily in Europe, resulted in
decreased revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013, as measured in U.S. dollars, of approximately 2.0% as compared to the same prior year period. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment
revenue increased in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same prior year period primarily due to increased operating income from productivity gains, pricing actions and disciplined
cost management.

Reported
revenues in our International Business segment increased 2.7% during the year ended December 31, 2012 over the same period last year. Internal growth was 2.8% supported
by solid 6.1% storage rental internal growth. Acquisitions contributed 5.1% to total reported revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to our acquisitions in Brazil and
Switzerland in the second quarter of 2012. These gains were partially offset by foreign currency fluctuations in 2012, primarily in Europe, that decreased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by
approximately 5.2% in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 2011. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased by 60 basis points in the year ended December 31,
2012 compared to the prior year period. Increased operating income from productivity gains and disciplined cost management contributed 150 basis points of improvement in 2012 over 2011. These gains
were partially offset by the costs associated with closing a facility in the United Kingdom and the impact of integration costs associated with acquisitions completed in 2012.

During
the year ended December 31, 2013, expenses in the Corporate segment as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased by 50 basis points compared to the year ended
December 31, 2012, primarily due to an $11.7 million increase in compensation costs, primarily associated with employee compensation and restructuring costs, as well as an
$8.7 million increase in professional fees and legal reserves.

During
the year ended December 31, 2012, expenses in the Corporate segment as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased 10 basis points compared to the year ended
December 31, 2011, primarily due to a $13.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and increased professional fees associated with strategic and corporate initiatives,
which was partially offset by reduced information technology expenses of $9.7 million and a $6.3 million reclassification of certain costs out of the Corporate segment and into the North
American Business segment in fiscal year 2012.

Net
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $506.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $443.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2012. The 14.2% year-over-year increase resulted primarily from an increase in cash provided by working capital of $84.0 million, offset by a decrease in net income,
including non-cash charges and realized foreign exchange gains, of $21.0 million.

Our
business requires capital expenditures to support our expected revenue growth and ongoing operations as well as new products and services and increased profitability. These
expenditures are included in the cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations. The nature of our capital expenditures has evolved over time along with the nature of our business. We
make capital expenditures to support a number of different objectives. The majority of our capital goes to support business-line growth and our ongoing operations, but we also expend capital to
support the development and improvement of products and services and projects designed to increase our profitability. These expenditures are generally small and discretionary in nature. Cash paid for
our capital expenditures, cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired) and additions to customer



acquisition
costs during the year ended December 31, 2013 amounted to $287.3 million, $317.1 million and $30.2 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31,
2013, these expenditures were funded with cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations, cash equivalents on hand and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility (defined
below). Excluding potential future acquisitions and Conversion Plan related capital expenditures, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $340.0 million in the year ending
December 31, 2014. Included in our estimated capital expenditures for 2014 is approximately $90.0 million of real estate and approximately $5.0 million associated with the
Conversion Plan.

Net
cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. During 2013, we received $782.3 million
in net proceeds from the issuance of the 6% Notes by IMI and the issuance of the Senior Subsidiary Notes by Canada Company and $135.1 million of net debt proceeds primarily from our Credit
Agreement (defined below). We used the proceeds from these transactions and cash on hand for the early retirement of an aggregate of $685.1 million of our 8% Notes, 8% Notes due 2020, the
Senior Subordinated Subsidiary Notes and the tender of a portion of our 8


/


% Notes and to pay dividends in the amount of $206.8 million on our common stock.

In
January 2014, in conjunction with a facility consolidation plan, we disposed of two facilities in the United Kingdom which resulted in net cash proceeds of approximately
$16.5 million. We will record a gain of approximately $9.3 million within (gain)/loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net in the first quarter of 2014 as a
result of these dispositions.

Share Repurchases and Dividends

Our board of directors has authorized up to $1.2 billion in repurchases of our common stock. All repurchases are subject to
stock price, market conditions, corporate and legal requirements and other factors. As of December 31, 2013, we had a remaining amount available for repurchase under our share repurchase
program of $66.0 million, which represents approximately 1% in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock based on the closing price on such date.

In
February 2010, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we have paid, and in the future intend to pay, quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Declaration
and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors. We may pay certain distributions in the form of cash and common stock if we are successful in converting to a
REIT. In 2012 and 2013, our board of directors declared the following dividends:

Potential REIT Conversion

In April 2011, we announced a three-year strategic plan that included stockholder payouts through a combination of share buybacks,
ongoing quarterly dividends and potential one-time dividends of



approximately
$2.2 billion through 2013, with approximately $1.2 billion to be paid out by May 2012. We fulfilled the commitment to return $1.2 billion of cash to stockholders by
May 2012. The Conversion Plan, however, includes several modifications to the previously announced stockholder payout plan. In accordance with tax rules applicable to REIT conversions, we anticipate
making E&P Distribution to stockholders of our accumulated earnings and profits which is estimated to be approximately $1.2 billion
to $1.7 billion, assuming we convert to a REIT effective January 1, 2014. We expect to pay the E&P Distribution in a combination of common stock and cash, with at least 80% of the E&P
Distribution in the form of common stock and up to 20% in cash. On October 11, 2012, we announced the declaration by our board of directors of a Special Dividend of $700 million payable,
at the election of the stockholders, in either common stock or cash to stockholders of record as of October 22, 2012 (the "Record Date"). The Special Dividend, which is a portion of the E&P
Distribution, was paid in a combination of common stock and cash on November 21, 2012 (the "Distribution Date") to stockholders of record as of the Record Date. Stockholders elected to be paid
their pro rata portion of the Special Dividend in all common stock or cash. The total amount of cash paid to all stockholders associated with the Special Dividend was approximately
$140.0 million (including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares). Our shares of common stock were valued for purposes of the Special Dividend based upon the average closing price on the three
trading days following November 14, 2012, or $32.87 per share, and we issued approximately 17.0 million shares of common stock in the Special Dividend, and the total value of common
stock paid to all stockholders associated with the Special Dividend was approximately $560.0 million. These shares will impact weighted average shares outstanding from the date of issuance,
thus impacting our earnings per share data prospectively from the Distribution Date. If we are successful in converting to a REIT, we anticipate that the balance of any additional E&P Distribution
will be paid out over several years beginning in the year we convert to a REIT based, in part, on IRS rules and the timing of the conversions of additional international operations into the REIT
structure during or after our first year as a REIT. With regard to our levels of indebtedness, we plan to operate within our target leverage ratio range of 4x–5x EBITDAR as defined in our
Credit Agreement (defined below). We may, however, temporarily operate above the high end of this range due to the timing of cash outlays related to the Conversion Plan.

There
are significant tax payments and other costs associated with implementing the Conversion Plan, and certain tax liabilities may be incurred regardless of whether we ultimately
succeed in converting to a REIT. In addition, we have undertaken major modifications to our internal systems, including accounting, information technology and real estate, in connection with the
Conversion Plan. We currently estimate that we will incur approximately $395.0 million to $425.0 million in costs to support the Conversion Plan, including approximately
$210.0 million to $225.0 million of related tax payments associated with a change in our method of depreciating and amortizing various assets, including certain of our racking
structures, from our current method to methods that are consistent with the characterization of such assets as real property. The total tax on recapture of depreciation and amortization expenses
across all relevant assets is expected to be paid out over up to five years beginning in 2012, with approximately $80.0 million paid in 2012 and $53.0 million paid in 2013. These tax
liabilities were already reflected as long-term deferred income taxes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As such, there will be no income statement impact associated with the payment of these tax
liabilities. However, we have reclassified approximately $123.9 million of long-term deferred income tax liabilities to current deferred income taxes (included within accrued expenses within
current liabilities) and prepaid and other assets (included within current assets) within our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2012. In 2013, we reclassified another
$26.9 million of long-term deferred income tax liabilities to current deferred income taxes. Additionally, we currently estimate the operating and capital expenditures associated with the
Conversion Plan through the end of 2014 to be approximately $185.0 million to $200.0 million. Of these amounts, approximately $47.0 million was incurred in 2012, including
approximately $12.5 million of capital expenditures, and approximately $106.3 million was incurred in 2013, including approximately $23.4 million of capital expenditures.



Financial Instruments and Debt

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money
market funds and time deposits), restricted cash (primarily U.S. Treasuries) and accounts receivable. The only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of December 31, 2013 relate to
cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash held on deposit with one global bank and one "Triple A" rated money market fund, which we consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade
institutions. As per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund to a maximum of
$50.0 million or in any one financial institution to a maximum of $75.0 million. As of December 31, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was
$154.4 million, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $36.6 million. A substantial portion of the money market fund is invested in U.S. Treasuries. As of
December 31, 2013, we had approximately $102.9 million of our cash and cash equivalents in foreign entities (excluding foreign branches of U.S. entities). We do not intend to repatriate
this cash and cash equivalents in the foreseeable future, and we have both the ability and the intent to reinvest these funds indefinitely outside the U.S. (see Note 7 to Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements).

We
are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2013 comprised the following (in

The
capital stock or other equity interests of most of our U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first-tier
foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure these debt instruments, together with all intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) of subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary
guarantors. In addition, Canada Company has pledged 66% of the capital stock of its subsidiaries, and all intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) owed to or held by it, to secure the
Canadian dollar subfacility under these debt instruments.

Collectively,
the "Parent Notes." IMI is the direct obligor on the Parent Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior or senior
subordinated basis, as the case may be, by substantially all of its direct and indirect 100% owned U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the
Guarantors. Canada Company and the remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Parent Notes.

(3)

Canada
Company is the direct obligor on the Senior Subsidiary Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior basis, by IMI and the
Guarantors. These guarantees are joint and several obligations of IMI and the Guarantors. See Note 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



(4)

Includes
(a) real estate mortgages of $3.7 million, (b) capital lease obligations of $255.1 million, and (c) other
various notes and other obligations, which were assumed by us as a result of certain acquisitions, of $39.6 million.

On
August 7, 2013, we amended our existing credit agreement. The revolving credit facilities (the "Revolving Credit Facility") under our credit agreement, as amended (the "Credit
Agreement"), allow IMI and certain of its U.S. and foreign subsidiaries to borrow in U.S. dollars and (subject to sublimits) a variety of other currencies (including Canadian dollars, British pounds
sterling, Euros, Brazilian reais and Australian dollars, among other currencies) in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed $1.5 billion. We have the right to request an increase in the
aggregate amount available to be borrowed under the Credit Agreement up to a maximum of $2.0 billion. At the time of the amendment, we repaid all term loans outstanding under our term loan
facility of our original credit agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility terminates on June 27, 2016, at which point all obligations under the Credit Agreement become due. IMI and substantially
all of its U.S. subsidiaries guarantee all obligations under the Credit Agreement, and have pledged the capital stock or other equity interests of most of their U.S. subsidiaries, up to 66% of the
capital stock or other equity interests of their first-tier foreign subsidiaries, and all intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) owed to or held by them to secure the Credit Agreement.
In addition, Canada Company has pledged 66% of the capital stock of its subsidiaries, and all intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) owed to or held by it to secure the Canadian dollar
subfacility under the Credit Agreement. The interest rate on borrowings
under the Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin, which varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio. Additionally, the
Credit Agreement requires the payment of a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, which fee ranges from between 0.3% to 0.5% based on certain financial ratios. There
are also fees associated with any outstanding letters of credit. As of December 31, 2013, we had $675.7 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility,
$525.5 million of which was denominated in U.S. dollars, 100.0 million of which was denominated in Canadian dollars and 40.7 million of which was denominated in Euros; we also had
various outstanding letters of credit totaling $3.5 million. The remaining amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility on December 31, 2013, based on IMI's
leverage ratio, which is calculated based on the last 12 months' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and rent expense ("EBITDAR"), and other adjustments as defined in
the Credit Agreement and current external debt, was $820.8 million. The average interest rate in effect under the Revolving Credit Facility was 2.7% and ranged from 2.4% to 4.5% as of
December 31, 2013. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, we recorded commitment fees and letters of credit fees of $2.1 million, $2.3 million and
$3.2 million, respectively, based on the unused balances under our revolving credit facilities and outstanding letters of credit. We recorded a charge of $5.5 million to other expense
(income), net in the third quarter of 2013 related to the amendment of our revolving credit and term loan facilities, representing a write-off of deferred financing costs.

In
August 2013, IMI completed an underwritten public offering of $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6% Notes, and Canada Company completed an underwritten public
offering of 200.0 million CAD in aggregate principal amount of Senior Subsidiary Notes, both of which were issued at 100% of par. The net proceeds to IMI and Canada Company of
$782.3 million, after paying the underwriters' discounts and commissions, were used to redeem all of the outstanding Senior Subordinated Subsidiary Notes, 8% Notes and 8% Notes due 2020, and to
fund the purchase of $137.5 million in principal amount of the 8


/


% Notes pursuant to a tender offer. The remaining net proceeds were used to repay existing indebtedness under
our Revolving Credit Facility.



In August 2013, we redeemed (1) the 175.0 million CAD aggregate principal amount outstanding of our Senior Subordinated Subsidiary Notes at 102.5%
of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, (2) the $50.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 8% Notes at 102.7% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, (3) the
$300.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 8% Notes due 2020 at 104.0% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and (4) $137.5 million aggregate principal
amount outstanding of our 8


/


% Notes at 109.8% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $38.1 million in the third
quarter of 2013 related to the early extinguishment of this debt. This charge consists of call and tender premiums, original issue discounts and deferred financing costs related to this debt.

In
January 2014, we redeemed the 150.0 million British pounds sterling (approximately $248.0 million) in aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 7


/


%
Notes at 100% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, utilizing borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and cash on-hand.

The
Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our
ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger.
Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the Credit Agreement, our indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness. The Credit Agreement, as amended in 2013,
uses EBITDAR-based calculations as the primary measures of financial performance, including leverage and
fixed charge coverage ratios. IMI's Credit Agreement net total lease adjusted leverage ratio was 5.0 as of December 31, 2013 (compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5), and its net secured
debt lease adjusted leverage ratio was 2.2 as of December 31, 2013 (compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 4.0). IMI's bond leverage ratio (which is not lease adjusted), per the indentures,
was 5.3 and 5.1 as of December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5. IMI's Credit Agreement, as amended in 2013, fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.5 as
of December 31, 2013, compared to a minimum allowable ratio of 1.5 under the Credit Agreement. Noncompliance with these leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios would have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and liquidity.

Our
ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic,
financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that
future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to make necessary capital expenditures.

Acquisitions

In May 2013, in order to further enhance our existing operations in the U.S., we acquired a storage rental and records management
business in Texas with locations in Michigan, Texas and Florida, in a cash transaction for a purchase price of approximately $25.0 million. Included in the purchase price is approximately
$1.6 million held in escrow to secure a post-closing working capital adjustment. The amounts held in escrow for purposes of the post-closing working capital adjustment will be distributed
either to us or the former owners based on the final agreed upon post-closing working capital amount.

In
June 2013, in order to further enhance our existing operations in Brazil, we acquired the stock of Archivum Comercial Ltda. and AMG Comercial Ltda., storage rental and
records management businesses in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in a single transaction for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $29.0 million. Included in the purchase price is approximately
$2.9 million held in escrow to secure a



post-closing
working capital adjustment and the indemnification obligations of the former owners of the businesses to us.

In
September 2013, in order to further enhance our existing operations in Latin America, we acquired certain entities with operations in Colombia and Peru. We acquired the stock of G4S
Secure Data Solutions Colombia S.A.S. and G4S Document Delivery S.A.S (collectively, "G4S"). G4S, a storage rental and records management business with operations in Bogota, Cali,
Medellin and Pereira, Colombia, was acquired in a single transaction for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $54.0 million, subject to post-closing working capital and net debt
adjustments. We also acquired the stock of File Service S.A., a storage rental and records management business in Peru, for a purchase price of approximately $16.0 million, subject to
post-closing working capital and net debt adjustments.

In
October 2013, in order to further enhance our existing operations in the U.S., we acquired Cornerstone, a national, full solution records and information-management company, in a cash
transaction for a purchase price of approximately $191.0 million. Included in the purchase price is approximately $9.0 million held in escrow to secure indemnification obligations and
certain working capital adjustments.

In
December 2013, in order to enhance our existing operations in China, we acquired Databox Records Management, a storage rental and records management business, for a purchase price of
approximately $8.6 million.

During
the first quarter of 2014, in order to further enhance our international operations, we acquired, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $39.6 million, Tape
Management Services Pty Ltd, a data management company with operations in Australia, and RM Arsiv Yönetim Hizmetleri Ticaret Anonim Sirketi, a
records and information management company with operations in Turkey.

(1)

Amounts
include variable rate interest payments, which are calculated utilizing the applicable interest rates as of December 31, 2013; see
Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts also include interest on capital leases.

(2)

Amounts
are offset by sublease income of $18.1 million in total (including $4.2 million, $9.4 million, $3.7 million and
$0.8 million, in less than 1 year, 1–3 years, 3–5 years and more than 5 years, respectively).

(3)

The
table above excludes $51.1 million in uncertain tax positions as we are unable to make reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if
any, with the respective taxing authorities.



We
expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and
other financings, which may include senior or senior subordinated notes, secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings, and the issuance of equity. We expect to
meet our long-term cash flow requirements using the same means described above. If we convert to a REIT, we expect our long-term capital allocation strategy will naturally shift toward increased use
of equity to support lower leverage, though our leverage has increased, in the short-term, to fund the costs of the Conversion Plan.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4)(ii).

Net Operating Losses and Foreign Tax Credit Carryforwards

We have federal net operating loss carryforwards, which expire in 2021 through 2033, of $70.3 million ($24.6 million, tax
effected) at December 31, 2013 to reduce future federal taxable income. We have assets for state net operating losses of $2.7 million (net of federal tax benefit), which expire in 2014
through 2025, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 45%. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $53.8 million, with various expiration dates (and in some cases no
expiration date), subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 72%. We also have foreign tax credits of $10.2 million, which will begin to expire in 2024.

Inflation

Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to
normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long-term real estate
leases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage rental or service charges.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Market Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money
market funds and time deposits), restricted cash (primarily U.S. Treasuries) and accounts receivable. The only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of December 31, 2013 relate to
cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash held on deposit with one global bank and one "Triple A" rated money market fund, which we consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade
institutions. As per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund to a maximum of
$50.0 million or in any one financial institution to a maximum of $75.0 million. As of December 31, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was
$154.4 million, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $36.6 million. A substantial portion of the money market fund is invested in U.S. Treasuries.

Interest Rate Risk

Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long-term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use
long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business at attractive rates, thereby helping to preserve our long-term returns on invested capital. We target approximately 75% of our debt
portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we will



use
interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. See Notes 3 and 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As
of December 31, 2013, we had $676.7 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of approximately 2.73%, and
$3,495.0 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2013, approximately 84% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our
variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2013 would have been reduced by approximately $3.3 million. See Note 4 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2013.

Currency Risk

Our investments in IME, Canada Company, Iron Mountain Mexico, SA de RL de CV, Iron Mountain South America, Ltd., Iron
Mountain Australia Pty Ltd. and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the U.S.
dollar. However, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the Euro, Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. Declines
in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local
currency.

The
impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. We
also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and IMI and our U.S.-based subsidiaries. In addition, Iron Mountain Switzerland GmbH, our foreign subsidiaries and
IME also have intercompany obligations between them. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary.

We
have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. One strategy is to finance certain of our international
subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. In determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax considerations, among
other factors. Another strategy we utilize is for IMI or Iron Mountain Information Management, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IMI, to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany
financing activities. In addition, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition, to lock in certain transaction
economics. We have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Canada. Specifically, through our 150.0 million British pounds sterling
denominated 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 and our 255.0 million 6


/


% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, we effectively hedge most of our
outstanding intercompany loans denominated in British pounds sterling and Euros. Canada Company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in Canadian dollars under the Credit Agreement
and its 200.0 million CAD denominated 6


/


% Senior Notes due 2021. This creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. We designated a portion of our 6


/


% Euro
Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 issued by IMI as a hedge of net investment of certain of our Euro denominated subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded $5.3 million ($3.2 million, net of
tax) of foreign exchange losses related to the "marking-to-market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in
stockholders' equity for the year ended December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, cumulative net gains of $7.5 million, net of tax are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge.



We
have also entered into a number of separate forward contracts to hedge our exposures to British pounds sterling, Australian dollars and Euros. As of December 31, 2013, we had
(1) outstanding forward contracts to purchase $206.1 million U.S. dollars and sell 127.5 million British pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with our European
operations; (2) an outstanding forward contract to purchase $62.3 million U.S. dollars and sell 70.0 million Australian dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with our
Australian subsidiary and (3) outstanding forward contracts to purchase 93.0 million Euros and sell $127.2 million U.S. dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with our United
Kingdom operations. At the maturity of the forward contracts, we may enter into new forward contracts to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. At the time of settlement, we either pay or
receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or
loss. We have not designated these forward contracts as hedges. At the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for
the mark-to-market valuation through other expense (income), net. During the year ended December 31, 2013, there was $7.0 million in net cash receipts included in cash from operating
activities from continuing operations related to settlements associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. We recorded net gains in connection with these forward contracts of
$3.0 million, including an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $0.1 million related to the Australian dollar forward contracts, and an unrealized foreign exchange loss of
$4.5 million related to certain British pound sterling forward contracts and an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $1.1 million related to the Euro forward contract in other expense
(income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as of December 31, 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany
balances are not hedged.

The
impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses.
Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect
of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items, net" component of equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end
2013 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $68.0 million.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The information required by this item is included in Item 15(a) of this Annual Report.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The term "disclosure controls and procedures" is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. These rules refer
to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information is recorded, processed, summarized and communicated to management, including its principal executive and
principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding what is required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act. As of
December 31, 2013 (the "Evaluation Date"), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that



evaluation,
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to
provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Due to their inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

(1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which is included in this Annual Report.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Iron Mountain Incorporated

Boston, Massachusetts

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Iron Mountain Incorporated and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework
(1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2013 of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Act of 1934) during the quarter ended December 31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Iron Mountain Incorporated

Boston, Massachusetts

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Iron Mountain Incorporated and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Iron Mountain Incorporated and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2013

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

1. Nature of Business

The accompanying financial statements represent the consolidated accounts of Iron Mountain Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("IMI") and its subsidiaries ("we" or "us"). We store
records, primarily paper documents and data backup media, and provide information management services in various locations throughout North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. We have a
diversified customer base consisting of commercial, legal, banking, health care, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations.

On
June 2, 2011, we sold (the "Digital Sale") our online backup and recovery, digital archiving and eDiscovery solutions businesses of our digital business (the "Digital
Business") to Autonomy Corporation plc, a corporation formed under the laws of England and Wales ("Autonomy"), pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement dated as of May 15, 2011 among
IMI, certain subsidiaries of IMI and Autonomy (the "Digital Sale Agreement"). Additionally, on October 3, 2011, we sold our records management operations in New Zealand. Also, on
April 27, 2012, we sold our records management operations in Italy. The financial position, operating results and cash flows of the Digital Business, our New Zealand operations and our Italian
operations, including the gain on the sale of the Digital Business and our New Zealand operations and the loss on the sale of our Italian operations, for all periods presented, have been reported as
discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. See Note 14 for a further discussion of these events.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

a.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
accompanying financial statements reflect our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows on a consolidated basis. All intercompany
account balances have been eliminated.

b.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires us to make estimates, judgments and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for
the period then ended. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates used. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that
we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

c.

Cash,
Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on hand and cash invested in highly liquid short-term securities, which have remaining maturities at the date of purchase of less than
90 days. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

We
have restricted cash associated with a collateral trust agreement with our insurance carrier related to our workers' compensation self-insurance program. The restricted cash subject
to this

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

agreement
was $33,612 and $33,860 as of December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively, and is included in current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restricted cash consists primarily of
U.S. Treasuries.

d.

Foreign
Currency

Local
currencies are the functional currencies for our operations outside the U.S., with the exception of certain foreign holding companies and our financing center in Switzerland, whose
functional currency is the U.S. dollar. In those instances where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates, and revenues and
expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the applicable period. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items, net component of Iron
Mountain Incorporated Stockholders' Equity and Noncontrolling Interests in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The gain or loss on foreign currency transactions, calculated as the difference
between the historical exchange rate and the exchange rate at the applicable measurement date, including those related to (1) our 7


/


% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014
(the "7


/


% Notes"), (2) our 6


/


% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the "6


/


% Notes"), (3) the borrowings in certain foreign
currencies under our revolving credit facility and (4) certain foreign currency denominated intercompany obligations of our foreign subsidiaries to us and between our foreign subsidiaries,
which are not considered permanently invested, are included in other expense (income), net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The total gain or loss on foreign currency
transactions amounted to a net loss of $17,352, $10,223 and $36,201 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

e.

Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

Every
derivative instrument is required to be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value. Periodically, we acquire derivative instruments
that are intended to hedge either cash flows or values that are subject to foreign exchange or other market price risk and not for trading purposes. We have formally documented our hedging
relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking each hedge transaction. Given the
recurring nature of our revenues and the long-term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby
preserving our long-term returns on invested capital. We target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we may use interest rate swaps as a
tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. In addition, we may use borrowings in foreign currencies, either obtained in the U.S. or by our foreign subsidiaries, to hedge foreign currency
risk associated with our international investments. Sometimes we enter into currency swaps to temporarily hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition, while we arrange permanent
financing or to hedge our exposure due to foreign currency exchange movements related to our intercompany accounts with and between our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2012 and 2013,
none of our derivative instruments contained credit-risk related contingent features.

Minor
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Major improvements which extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or the efficiency of property owned are
capitalized. Major improvements to leased buildings are capitalized as leasehold improvements and depreciated.

We
develop various software applications for internal use. Computer software costs associated with internal use software are expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria
are met. Payroll and related costs for employees directly associated with, and devoting time to, the development of internal use computer software projects (to the extent time is spent directly on the
project) are capitalized. During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, we capitalized $26,755 and $39,487 of costs, respectively, associated with the development of internal use computer
software projects. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended.
Capitalization ends when the asset is ready for its intended use. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are periodically evaluated
for impairment. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, we wrote-off $3,500 (approximately $3,050 associated with our International Business segment and approximately $450
associated with our North American Business

Entities
are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. Asset retirement obligations represent the costs
to replace or remove tangible long-lived assets required by law, regulatory rule or contractual agreement. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the
carrying amount of the related long-lived asset, which is then depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The liability is increased over time through accretion expense (included in
depreciation expense) such that the liability will equate to the future cost to retire the long-lived asset at the expected retirement date. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles
the obligation for its recorded amount or realizes a gain or loss upon settlement. Our obligations are primarily the result of requirements under our facility lease agreements which generally have
"return to original condition" clauses which would require us to remove or restore items such as shred pits, vaults, demising walls and office build-outs, among others. The significant assumptions
used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are the timing of removals, the probability of a requirement to perform, estimated cost and associated expected inflation rates that are
consistent with historical rates and credit-adjusted risk-free rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate.

A
reconciliation of liabilities for asset retirement obligations (included in other long-term liabilities) is as follows:

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Other than goodwill, we
currently have no intangible assets that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives are amortized over their useful
lives. We annually assess whether a change in the life over which our intangible assets are amortized is necessary or more frequently if events or circumstances warrant.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2013

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

We have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and noted
no impairment of goodwill at those dates. However, as a result of interim triggering events as discussed below, we recorded a provisional goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2011
associated with our Continental Western Europe (as defined below) operations. This provisional goodwill impairment charge was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2011. As of December 31, 2013,
no factors were identified that would alter our October 1, 2013 goodwill assessment. In making this assessment, we relied on a number of factors including operating results, business plans,
anticipated future cash flows, transactions and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.
When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values.

In
September 2011, as a result of certain changes we made in the manner in which our European operations are managed, we reorganized our reporting structure and reassigned goodwill among
the revised reporting units. Previously, we tested goodwill impairment at the European level on a combined basis. As a result of the management and reporting changes, we concluded at that time that we
had three reporting units within our European operations: (1) United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway ("UKI"); (2) Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain ("Continental
Western Europe"); and (3) the remaining countries in Europe ("Central Europe"). As a result of the restructuring of our reporting units, we concluded that we had an interim triggering event,
and, therefore, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for UKI, Continental Western Europe and Central Europe in the third quarter of 2011, as of August 31, 2011. As required by GAAP,
prior to our goodwill impairment analysis, we performed an impairment assessment on the long-lived assets within our UKI, Continental Western Europe and Central Europe reporting units and noted no
impairment, except for our Italian operations, which was included in our Continental Western Europe reporting unit, and which is now included in discontinued operations as discussed in Note 14.
Based on our analysis, we concluded that the goodwill of our UKI and Central Europe reporting units was not impaired. Our Continental Western Europe reporting unit's fair value was less than its
carrying value, and, as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $46,500 included as a component of intangible impairments from continuing operations in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. A tax benefit of approximately $5,449 was recorded associated with the Continental Western Europe goodwill impairment charge for
the year ended
December 31, 2011 and is included in the provision (benefit) for income taxes from continuing operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 14 for the
portion of the charge allocated to our Italian operations based on a relative fair value basis.

In
2012, we reorganized the management and reporting structure of our international operations. As a result of the management and reporting changes, we concluded that we have the
following six reporting units: (1) North America; (2) United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain ("Western Europe"); (3) the
remaining countries in Europe in which we operate, excluding Russia and the Ukraine ("Emerging Markets"); (4) Latin America; (5) Australia, China, Hong Kong and Singapore ("Asia
Pacific"); and (6) India, Russia and the Ukraine ("Emerging Market Joint Ventures"). As of December 31, 2012, the carrying value of goodwill, net

amounted
to $1,762,307, $365,303, $87,492, $56,893 and $62,764 for North America, Western Europe, Emerging Markets, Latin America and Asia Pacific, respectively. Our Emerging Market Joint Ventures
reporting unit had no goodwill as of December 31, 2012 and 2013. As of December 31, 2013, the carrying value of goodwill, net amounted to $1,849,440, $375,954, $88,599, $93,149 and
$56,210 for North America, Western Europe, Emerging Markets, Latin America and Asia Pacific, respectively. Based on our goodwill impairment assessment, all of our reporting units with goodwill had
estimated fair values as of October 1, 2013 that exceeded their carrying values by greater than 15%.

Reporting
unit valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit or a combined approach based on the present
value of future cash flows and market and transaction multiples of revenues and earnings. The income approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected
capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. In conjunction with our
annual goodwill impairment reviews, we reconcile the sum of the valuations of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of such dates.

Long-Lived
Assets

We
review long-lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations
are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then
intangible assets are written

assets.

Consolidated
gain on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net of $2,286 in the year ended December 31, 2011 consisted primarily of a gain of approximately $3,200
related to the disposition of a facility in Canada and a gain of approximately $3,000 on the retirement of leased vehicles accounted for as capital lease assets associated with our North American
Business segment, offset by a loss associated with discontinued use of certain third-party software licenses of approximately $3,500 (approximately $3,050 associated with our International Business
segment and approximately $450 associated with our North American Business segment). Consolidated loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net was $4,400 in the year ended
December 31, 2012 and consisted primarily of approximately $5,500, $1,900 and $500 of asset write-offs in Europe, North America and Latin America, respectively, partially offset by
approximately $3,500 of gains associated with the retirement of leased vehicles accounted for as capital lease assets associated with our North American Business segment. Consolidated gain on
disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net was $1,417 in the year ended December 31, 2013 and consisted primarily of gains of approximately $2,500 on the retirement of leased
vehicles accounted for as capital lease assets associated with our North American Business segment and the sale of two buildings in the United Kingdom of approximately $1,800, partially offset by
approximately $2,000 of asset write-offs in North America and approximately $900 of asset write-offs associated with our European operations.

Customer
Relationships and Acquisition Costs and Other Intangible Assets

Costs
related to the acquisition of large volume accounts are capitalized. Initial costs incurred to transport the boxes to one of our facilities, which includes labor and transportation
charges, are amortized over periods ranging from one to 30 years (weighted average of 26 years at December 31, 2013), and are included in depreciation and amortization in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Payments to a customer's current records management vendor or direct payments to a customer are amortized over periods ranging from one to
10 years (weighted average of five years at December 31, 2013) to the storage and service revenue line items in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. If the customer
terminates its relationship with us, the unamortized cost is charged to expense or revenue. However, in the event of such termination, we generally collect, and record as income, permanent removal
fees that generally equal or exceed the amount of the unamortized costs. Customer relationship intangible assets acquired through business combinations, which represents the majority of the balance,
are amortized over periods ranging from 10 to 30 years (weighted average of 21 years at December 31, 2013). Amounts allocated in purchase accounting to customer relationship
intangible assets are calculated based upon estimates of their fair value utilizing an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Other intangible assets, including
noncompetition agreements, acquired core technology and trademarks, are capitalized and amortized over periods ranging from five to 10 years (weighted average of seven years at
December 31, 2013).

Revenues

Our
revenues consist of storage rental revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes. Storage rental revenues, which are considered a key
driver of financial performance for the storage and information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic rental charges related to the storage of materials or data
(generally on a per unit basis). Service revenues include charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services. Included in core service revenues are:
(1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records and the destruction of records; (2) courier
operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring services, including the
scanning, imaging and document conversion services of active and inactive records, or Document Management Solutions ("DMS"), which relate to physical and digital records, and recurring project
revenues. Our complementary services revenues include special project work, customer termination and permanent withdrawal fees, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services,
technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). Our secure shredding revenues include the sale of recycled paper (included in
complementary services revenues), the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility and reducing the predictability of that revenue stream.

We
recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
collectability of the

resulting
receivable is reasonably assured. Storage rental and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage rental or service is provided, and customers are generally billed on
a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms. Amounts related to future storage rental or prepaid service contracts for customers where storage rental fees or services are billed in advance are
accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the period the applicable storage rental or service is provided or performed. Revenues from the sales of products, which is included as a
component of service revenues, is recognized when products are shipped and title has passed to the customer. Revenues from the sales of products have historically not been significant.

m.

Rent
Normalization

We
have entered into various leases for buildings that expire over various terms. Certain leases have fixed escalation clauses (excluding those tied to the consumer price index or other
inflation-based indices) or other features (including return to original condition, primarily in the United Kingdom) which require normalization of the rental expense over the life of the lease
resulting in deferred rent being reflected as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we have assumed various above and below market leases in connection with certain
of our acquisitions. The difference between the present value of these lease obligations and the market rate at the date of the acquisition was recorded as a deferred rent liability or other long-term
asset and is being amortized over the remaining lives of the respective leases.

Stock-Based
Compensation

We
record stock-based compensation expense, utilizing the straight-line method, for the cost of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and shares of
stock issued under the 2003 employee stock purchase plan and the 2013 employee stock purchase plan (together, "Employee Stock-Based Awards").

Stock-based
compensation expense for Employee Stock-Based Awards included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and
2013 was $17,510, including $260 in discontinued operations, ($8,834 after tax or $0.05 per basic and diluted share), $30,360 ($23,437 after tax or $0.14 per basic and $0.13 per diluted share) and

Flows.
This requirement reduces reported operating cash flows and increases reported financing cash flows. As a result, net financing cash flows from continuing operations included $919, $1,045 and
$2,389 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, from the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost. The tax benefit of any resulting excess
tax deduction increases the Additional Paid-in Capital ("APIC") pool. Any resulting tax deficiency is deducted from the APIC pool.

Stock Options

Under our various stock option plans, options were granted with exercise prices equal to the market price of the stock on the date of
grant. The majority of our options become exercisable ratably over a period of five years from the date of grant and generally have a contractual life of ten years from the date of grant, unless the
holder's employment is terminated sooner. Certain of the options we issue become exercisable ratably over a period of ten years from the date of grant and have a contractual life of 12 years
from the date of grant, unless the holder's employment is terminated sooner. As of December 31, 2013, ten-year vesting options represented 7.5% of total outstanding options. Beginning in 2011,
certain of the options we issue become exercisable ratably over a period of three years from the date of grant and have a contractual life of ten years from the date of grant, unless the holder's
employment is terminated sooner. As of December 31, 2013, three-year vesting options represented 20.5% of total outstanding options. Our non-employee directors are considered employees for
purposes of our stock option plans and stock option reporting. Options granted to our non-employee directors generally become exercisable one year from the date of grant.

In
December 2008, we amended each of the Iron Mountain Incorporated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, the Iron Mountain Incorporated 1997 Stock Option Plan and the LiveVault Corporation 2001
Stock Incentive Plan (each a "Plan") to provide that any unvested options and other awards granted under each respective Plan shall vest immediately should an employee be terminated by the Company, or
terminate his or her own employment for good reason (as defined in each Plan), in connection with a vesting change in control (as defined in each Plan). The Mimosa Systems, Inc. 2009 Equity
Incentive Plan and the Mimosa Systems, Inc. 2003 Stock Plan were similarly amended in June 2010.

A
total of 38,917,411 shares of common stock have been reserved for grants of options and other rights under our various stock incentive plans. The number of shares available for grant
at December 31, 2013 was 5,814,061.

The
weighted average fair value of options granted in 2011, 2012 and 2013 was $7.42, $7.00 and $7.69 per share, respectively. These values were estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following table summarizes the weighted average assumptions used for grants in the year ended December 31:

Expected
volatility is calculated utilizing daily historical volatility over a period that equates to the expected life of the option. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S.
Treasury interest rates whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options. Expected dividend yield is considered in the option pricing model and represents our current annualized
expected per share dividends over the current trade price of our common stock. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) of the stock options granted is estimated using the historical
exercise behavior of employees.

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units

Under our various equity compensation plans, we may also grant restricted stock or restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Our restricted
stock and RSUs generally have a three to five year vesting period from the date of grant. All RSUs accrue dividend equivalents associated with the underlying stock as we declare dividends. Dividends
will generally be paid to holders of RSUs in cash upon the vesting date of the associated RSU and will be forfeited if the RSU does not vest. We accrued approximately $1,378 and $1,854 of cash
dividends on RSUs for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively. We paid approximately $58 and $820 of cash dividends on RSUs for the years ended December 31, 2012 and
2013, respectively. The fair value of restricted stock and RSUs is the excess of the market price of our common stock at the date of grant over the purchase price (which is typically zero).

years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 was $931, $8,296 and $16,638, respectively.

Performance Units

Under our various equity compensation plans, we may also make awards of performance units ("PUs"). For the majority of PUs, the number
of PUs earned is determined based on our performance against predefined calendar year targets of revenue growth and return on invested capital ("ROIC"). The number of PUs earned may range from 0% to
150% of the initial award. The number of PUs earned is determined based on our actual performance as compared to the targets at the end of the one-year performance period. Certain PUs granted in 2013
will be earned based on a market condition associated with the total return on our common stock in relation to a subset of the S&P 500 rather than the revenue growth and ROIC targets noted
above. The number of PUs earned based on this market condition may range from 0% to 200% of the initial award. All of our PUs will be settled in shares of our common stock and are subject to cliff
vesting three years from the date of the original PU grant. Employees who subsequently terminate their employment after the end of the one-year performance period and on or after attaining age 55 and
completing 10 years of qualifying service (the "retirement criteria") shall immediately and completely vest in any PUs earned based on the actual

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

achievement
against the predefined targets as discussed above (but delivery of the shares remains deferred). As a result, PUs are generally expensed over the shorter of (1) the vesting period,
(2) achievement of the retirement criteria, which may occur as early as January 1 of the year following the year of grant, or (3) a maximum of three years. Outstanding PUs accrue
dividend equivalents associated with the underlying stock as we declare dividends. Dividends will generally be paid to holders of PUs in cash upon the settlement date of the associated PU and will be
forfeited if the PU does not vest. We accrued approximately $369 and $681 of cash dividends on PUs for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

In
2011, 2012 and 2013, we issued 154,239, 221,781 and 198,869 PUs, respectively. For PUs that are earned based on our performance against revenue growth and ROIC targets during the
one-year performance period, we forecast the likelihood of achieving the predefined annual revenue growth and ROIC targets in order to calculate the expected PUs to be earned. We record a compensation
charge based on either the forecasted PUs to be earned (during the one-year performance period) or the actual PUs earned (at the one-year anniversary date) over the vesting period for each of the
awards. For the 2013 PUs that will be earned based on a market condition, we utilized a Monte Carlo simulation to fair value these awards at the date of grant, and such fair value will be expensed
over the three-year performance period. No PUs vested during 2011. The total fair value of earned PUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 was $4,285 and $2,962,
respectively. There were no cash dividends paid on PUs for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013. As of December 31, 2013, we expected 70.0% achievement of the predefined
revenue and ROIC targets associated with the awards of PUs made in 2013.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We offer an employee stock purchase plan (the "ESPP") in which participation is available to substantially all U.S. and Canadian
employees who meet certain service eligibility requirements. The



IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

ESPP
provides a way for our eligible employees to become stockholders on favorable terms. The ESPP provides for the purchase of our common stock by eligible employees through successive offering
periods. We have historically had two six-month offering periods per year, the first of which generally runs from June 1 through November 30 and the second of which generally runs from
December 1 through May 31. During each offering period, participating employees accumulate after-tax payroll contributions, up to a maximum of 15% of their compensation, to pay the
purchase price at the end of the offering. Participating employees may withdraw from an offering before the purchase date and obtain a refund of the amounts withheld as payroll deductions. At the end
of the offering period, outstanding options under the ESPP are exercised, and each employee's accumulated contributions are used to purchase our common stock. The price for shares purchased under the
ESPP is 95% of the fair market price at the end of the offering period, without a look-back feature. As a result, we do not recognize compensation expense for the ESPP shares purchased. For the years
ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, there were 154,559 shares, 151,285 shares and 144,432 shares, respectively, purchased under the ESPP. Our prior ESPP was replaced subsequent to the
expiration of our June 1 offering on November 29, 2013, by the Iron Mountain Incorporated 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which was approved by our stockholders at the 2013 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders held on June 6, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, we have 1,000,000 shares available under the ESPP.

As
of December 31, 2013, unrecognized compensation cost related to the unvested portion of our Employee Stock-Based Awards was $41,877 and is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 2.0 years.

We
generally issue shares of our common stock for the exercises of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, PUs and shares of our common stock under our ESPP from unissued reserved shares.

o.

Income
Taxes

Accounting
for income taxes requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and
financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when recovery of deferred tax assets does not meet the more likely than not
standard as defined in GAAP. We have elected to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

p.

Income
(Loss) Per Share—Basic and Diluted

Basic
income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The calculation of diluted income (loss) per
share is consistent with that of basic income (loss) per share but gives effect to all potential common shares (that is, securities such as options, warrants or convertible securities) that were
outstanding during the period, unless the effect is antidilutive.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memo Reserves

We
maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments and potential
disputes regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables and credit memo activity, current
economic conditions and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or
impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. We consider accounts

Concentrations
of Credit Risk

Financial
instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits), restricted cash
(primarily U.S. Treasuries) and accounts receivable. The only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of both December 31, 2012 and 2013 relate to cash and cash equivalents and
restricted cash held on deposit with five global banks and two "Triple A" rated money market funds, and one global bank and one "Triple A" rated money market fund, respectively, all of which we
consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade institutions. As per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any
one mutual fund to a maximum of $50,000 or in any one financial institution to a maximum of $75,000. As of December 31, 2012 and 2013, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balance
was $277,027 and $154,386, respectively, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $218,629 and $36,613, respectively. A substantial portion of the money market funds is invested in
U.S. Treasuries.

Fair
Value Measurements

Entities
are permitted under GAAP to elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at either fair value or cost. We did not elect the fair value measurement option
for any of our financial assets or liabilities.

Our
financial assets or liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. A financial asset or liability's classification within the hierarchy is
determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

Level 1—Inputs
are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.



IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2013

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Level 2—Inputs
include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that
are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or
corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).

Level 3—Unobservable
inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

The
following tables provide the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively:

3. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We have entered into a number of separate forward contracts to hedge our exposures in British pounds sterling, Australian dollars and Euros. As of December 31, 2013, we had
(1) outstanding forward contracts to purchase $206,069 U.S. dollars and sell 127,500 British pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with our United Kingdom operations;
(2) an outstanding forward contract to purchase $62,300 U.S. dollars and sell 70,000 Australian dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with our Australian subsidiary and
(3) outstanding forward contracts to purchase 93,000 Euros and sell $127,219 U.S. dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with our United Kingdom operations. At the maturity of the
forward contracts, we may enter into new forward contracts to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the
forward contract and recognize this amount in other (income) expense, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. At the end of each
month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation. We have not designated these forward contracts as
hedges. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, there was $1,092 in net cash disbursements, $9,116 in net cash disbursements and $6,954 in net cash receipts, respectively,
included in cash from operating activities from continuing operations related to settlements associated with these foreign currency forward contracts.

Our
policy is to record the fair value of each derivative instrument on a gross basis. The following table provides the fair value of our derivative instruments as of December 31,
2012 and 2013 and their gains and losses for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013:

% Notes as a hedge of net investment of certain of our Euro denominated
subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded foreign exchange gains of $8,634 ($5,411, net of tax) related to the change in fair value of such debt due to currency translation adjustments, which is a
component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in Iron Mountain Incorporated Stockholders' Equity for the year ended December 31, 2011. We recorded foreign exchange losses of
$4,408 ($2,668, net of tax) related to the change in fair value of such debt due to currency translation adjustments, which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in
Iron Mountain Incorporated Stockholders' Equity for the year ended December 31, 2012. We recorded foreign exchange losses of $5,311 ($3,238, net of tax) related to the change in fair value of
such debt due to currency translation adjustments, which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in Iron Mountain Incorporated Stockholders' Equity for the year ended

The
capital stock or other equity interests of most of our U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first-tier
foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure these debt instruments, together with all intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) of subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary
guarantors. In addition, Iron Mountain Canada Operations ULC (f/k/a Iron Mountain Canada Corporation) ("Canada Company") has pledged 66% of the capital stock of its subsidiaries, and all
intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) owed to or held by it, to secure the Canadian dollar subfacility under these debt instruments. The fair value (Level 3 of fair value
hierarchy described at Note 2.s.) of this long-term debt approximates the carrying value (as borrowings under these debt instruments are based on current variable market interest rates (plus a
margin that is subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio)), as of December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

Collectively,
the "Parent Notes." IMI is the direct obligor on the Parent Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior or senior
subordinated basis, as the case may be, by substantially all of its direct and indirect 100% owned U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the

Canada

a weighted average interest rate of 5.8% as of December 31, 2013 and (c) other various notes and other obligations, which were assumed by us as a result of certain acquisitions, of
$14,680 and $39,619 as of December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively, and bear a weighted average interest rate of 14.3% as of December 31, 2013. We believe the fair value (Level 3
of fair value hierarchy described at Note 2.s.) of this debt approximates its carrying value.

a.

Revolving
Credit Facility

On
August 7, 2013, we amended our existing credit agreement. The revolving credit facilities (the "Revolving Credit Facility") under our credit agreement, as amended (the "Credit
Agreement"), allow IMI and certain of its U.S. and foreign subsidiaries to borrow in U.S. dollars and (subject to sublimits) a variety of other currencies (including Canadian dollars, British pounds
sterling, Euros, Brazilian reais and Australian dollars, among other currencies) in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed $1,500,000. We have the right to request an increase in the aggregate
amount available to be borrowed
under the Credit Agreement up to a maximum of $2,000,000. At the time of the amendment, we repaid all term loans outstanding under our term loan facility of our original credit agreement. The
Revolving Credit Facility terminates on June 27, 2016, at which point all obligations under the Credit Agreement become due. IMI and substantially all of its U.S. subsidiaries guarantee all
obligations under the Credit Agreement, and have pledged the capital stock or other equity interests of most of their U.S. subsidiaries, up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of
their first-tier foreign subsidiaries, and all intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) owed to or held by them to secure the Credit Agreement. In addition, Canada Company has pledged 66%
of the capital stock of its subsidiaries, and all intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) owed to or held by it to secure the Canadian dollar subfacility under the Credit Agreement. The
interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin, which varies based on our consolidated leverage
ratio. Additionally, the Credit

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2013

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

4. Debt (Continued)

Agreement
requires the payment of a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, which fee ranges from between 0.3% to 0.5% based on certain financial ratios. There are also
fees associated with any outstanding letters of credit. As of December 31, 2013, we had $675,717 of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, $525,538 of which was denominated
in U.S. dollars, 100,000 of which was denominated in Canadian dollars and 40,715 of which was denominated in Euros; we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $3,460. The remaining
amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility on December 31, 2013, based on IMI's leverage ratio, which is calculated based on the last 12 months' earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and rent expense ("EBITDAR"), and other adjustments as defined in the Credit Agreement and current external debt, was $820,823. The average interest rate
in effect under the Revolving Credit Facility was 2.7% and ranged from 2.4% to 4.5% as of December 31, 2013. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013,we recorded commitment
fees and letters of credit fees of $2,123, $2,306 and $3,167, respectively, based on the unused balances under our revolving credit facilities and outstanding letters of credit. We recorded a charge
of $5,544 to other expense (income), net in the third quarter of 2013 related to the amendment of our revolving credit and term loan facilities, representing a write-off of deferred financing costs.

The
Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our
ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger.
Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the Credit Agreement, our indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness. The Credit Agreement, as amended in 2013,
uses EBITDAR-based calculations as the primary measures of financial performance, including leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. IMI's Credit Agreement net total lease adjusted leverage ratio
was 5.0 as of December 31, 2013 (compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5), and its net secured debt lease adjusted leverage ratio was 2.2 as of December 31, 2013 (compared to a
maximum allowable ratio of 4.0). IMI's bond leverage ratio (which is not lease adjusted), per the indentures, was 5.3 and 5.1 as of December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively, compared to a
maximum allowable ratio of 6.5. IMI's Credit Agreement, as amended in 2013, fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.5 as of December 31, 2013, compared to a minimum allowable ratio of 1.5 under the
Credit Agreement. Noncompliance with these
leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.

b.

Notes
Issued under Indentures

As
of December 31, 2013, we had seven series of senior subordinated or senior notes issued under various indentures, six of which are direct obligations of the parent company,
IMI; one (the Senior Subsidiary Notes) is a direct obligation of Canada Company; and all are subordinated to debt outstanding under the Credit Agreement, except the 6% Notes and the Senior Subsidiary

The
Parent Notes and the Senior Subsidiary Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior or senior subordinated basis, as the case may be, by the Guarantors. These
guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the senior or senior subordinated notes. Additionally, IMI guarantees the Senior
Subsidiary Notes. Canada Company does not guarantee the Parent Notes.

In
August 2013, IMI completed an underwritten public offering of $600,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6% Notes, and Canada Company completed an underwritten public offering of
200,000 CAD in aggregate principal amount of Senior Subsidiary Notes, both of which were issued at 100% of par (together, the "August 2013 Offerings"). The net proceeds to IMI and Canada Company of
$782,307, after paying the underwriters' discounts and commissions, were used to redeem all of the outstanding Senior Subordinated Subsidiary Notes, 8% Notes and 8% Notes due 2020, and to fund the
purchase of $137,500 in principal amount of the 8


/


% Notes pursuant to a tender offer. The remaining net proceeds were used to repay existing indebtedness under our Revolving Credit
Facility.

In
August 2013, we redeemed (1) the 175,000 CAD aggregate principal amount outstanding of our Senior Subordinated Subsidiary Notes at 102.5% of par, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, (2) the $50,000 aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 8% Notes at 102.7% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, (3) the $300,000 aggregate principal amount
outstanding of our 8% Notes due 2020 at 104.0% of par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and (4) $137,500 aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 8

5. Selected Consolidated Financial Statements of Parent, Guarantors, Canada Company and Non-Guarantors

The following data summarizes the consolidating results of IMI on the equity method of accounting as of December 31, 2012 and 2013 and for the years ended December 31,
2011, 2012 and 2013 and are prepared on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements.

The
Parent Notes and the Senior Subsidiary Notes are guaranteed by the subsidiaries referred to below as the Guarantors. These subsidiaries are 100% owned by IMI. The guarantees are full
and unconditional, as well as joint and several.

Additionally,
IMI and the Guarantors guarantee the Senior Subsidiary Notes which were issued by Canada Company. Canada Company does not guarantee the Parent Notes. The other subsidiaries
that do not guarantee the Parent Notes or the Senior Subsidiary Notes are referred to below as the Non-Guarantors.

5. Selected Consolidated Financial Statements of Parent, Guarantors, Canada Company and Non-Guarantors (Continued)

In
the normal course of business we periodically change the ownership structure of our subsidiaries to meet the requirements of our business. In the event of such changes, we recast the
prior period financial information within this footnote to conform to the current period presentation in the period such changes occur. Generally, these changes do not alter the designation of the
underlying subsidiaries as Guarantors or Non-Guarantors. However, they may change whether the underlying subsidiary is owned by the Parent, a Guarantor, Canada Company or a Non-Guarantor. If such a
change occurs, the amount of investment in subsidiaries in the below balance sheets and equity in the earnings (losses) of subsidiaries, net of tax in the below statements of operations with respect
to the relevant Parent, Guarantors, Canada Company, Non-Guarantors and Eliminations columns also would change.

In
July 2013, certain of Canada Company's operating subsidiaries (the "Amalgamated Entities") were amalgamated into Canada Company and, as part of our proposed conversion to a real
estate investment trust ("REIT"), Canada Company contributed certain assets and liabilities into two newly-formed wholly owned entities (the "Canadian Subsidiaries"). The assets, liabilities, equity,
results of operations and cash flows of the Amalgamated Entities, previously presented within the Non-Guarantors column, are now presented within the Canada Company column. The assets, liabilities,
equity, results of operations and cash flows of the Canadian Subsidiaries, previously presented within the Canada Company column, are now presented within the Non-Guarantors column.

IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2013

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

6. Acquisitions

We account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, and, accordingly, the results of operations for each acquisition have been included in our consolidated results
from their respective acquisition dates. Cash consideration for our various acquisitions was primarily provided through borrowings under our credit facilities and cash equivalents on-hand. The
unaudited pro forma results of operations (including revenue and earnings) for the current and prior periods are not presented due to the insignificant impact of the 2011, 2012 and 2013 acquisitions
on our consolidated results of operations. Noteworthy acquisitions are as follows:

In
January 2011, we acquired the remaining 80% interest of our joint venture in Poland (Iron Mountain Poland Holdings Limited) in a stock transaction for an estimated purchase price of
approximately $80,000, including an initial cash purchase price of $35,000. As a result, we now own 100% of our Polish operations, which provide storage rental and records and information management
services. The terms of the purchase and sale agreement also required a second payment based upon the audited financial results of the joint venture. This payment of $42,259 was based upon a formula
defined in the purchase and sale agreement and was paid in the second quarter of 2011. Additionally, in July 2012, we paid $2,500 of contingent consideration based upon the satisfaction of certain
performance criteria. The carrying value of the 20% interest that we previously held and accounted for under the equity method of accounting amounted to approximately $5,774, and the fair value on the
date of the acquisition of such interest of the additional 80% interest was approximately $11,694 and resulted in a gain being recorded to other (income) expense, net of approximately $5,920 in the
year ended December 31, 2011. The fair value of our previously held equity interest was derived by reducing the total estimated consideration for the 80% equity interest purchased by 40%, which
represents management's estimate of the control premium paid, in order to derive the fair value of $11,694 for the 20% noncontrolling equity interest which we previously held. We determined that a 40%
control premium was appropriate after considering the size and location of the business acquired, the potential future profits expected to be generated by the Polish entity and publicly available
market data. One of the members of our board of directors and several of his family members held an indirect equity interest in one of the stockholders that received proceeds in connection with this
transaction. As a result of this equity interest, such board member, together with several of his family members, received approximately 24% of the purchase price that we paid (including the
contingent consideration discussed above).

In
April 2012, in order to enhance our existing operations in Brazil, we acquired the stock of Grupo Store, a storage rental and records management and data protection business in Brazil
with locations in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre and Recife, for a purchase price of approximately $79,000 ($75,000, net of cash acquired). Included in the purchase price is approximately
$8,000 being held in escrow to secure a working capital adjustment and the indemnification obligations of the former owners of the business ("Sellers") to IMI. In 2013, approximately $1,500 of the
escrow funds were released to the Sellers in connection with the final working capital adjustment. Unless paid to us in accordance with the terms of the agreement, all amounts remaining in escrow
after any indemnification payments are paid out will be released to the Sellers in four annual installments, commencing in April 2014.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2013

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

6. Acquisitions (Continued)

In
May 2012, we acquired a controlling interest of our joint venture in Switzerland (Sispace AG), which provides storage rental and records and information management services, in a
stock transaction for a cash purchase price of approximately $21,600. The carrying value of the 15% interest that we previously held and accounted for under the equity method of accounting amounted to
approximately $1,700 as of the date of acquisition, and the fair value on the date of the acquisition of such interest was approximately $2,700. This resulted in a gain being recorded to other income
(expense), net of approximately $1,000 in the second quarter of 2012. The fair value of our previously held equity interest was derived by reducing the total estimated consideration for the
controlling interest purchased by 30%, which represents management's estimate of the control premium paid, in order to derive the fair value of $2,700 for the 15% noncontrolling equity interest which
we previously held. We determined the 30% control premium was appropriate after considering the size and location of the business acquired, the potential future profits expected to be generated by the
Swiss entity and other publicly available market data.

In
May 2013, in order to further enhance our existing operations in the U.S., we acquired a storage rental and records management business in Texas with locations in Michigan, Texas and
Florida, in a cash transaction for a purchase price of approximately $25,000. Included in the purchase price is approximately $1,600 held in escrow to secure a post-closing working capital adjustment.
The amounts held in escrow for purposes of the post-closing working capital adjustment will be distributed either to us or the former owners based on the final agreed upon post-closing working capital
amount.

In
June 2013, in order to further enhance our existing operations in Brazil, we acquired the stock of Archivum Comercial Ltda. and AMG Comercial Ltda., storage rental and
records management businesses in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in a single transaction for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $29,000. Included in the purchase price is approximately $2,900 held in
escrow to secure a post-closing working capital adjustment and the indemnification obligations of the former owners of the businesses to us.

In
September 2013, in order to further enhance our existing operations in Latin America, we acquired certain entities with operations in Colombia and Peru. We acquired the stock of G4S
Secure Data Solutions Colombia S.A.S. and G4S Document Delivery S.A.S (collectively, "G4S"). G4S, a storage rental and records management business with operations in Bogota, Cali,
Medellin and Pereira, Colombia, was acquired in a single transaction for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $54,000, subject to post-closing working capital and net debt adjustments. We also
acquired the stock of File Service S.A., a storage rental and records management business in Peru, for a purchase price of approximately $16,000, subject to post-closing working capital and net
debt adjustments.

In
October 2013, in order to further enhance our existing operations in the U.S., we acquired Cornerstone Records Management, LLC and its affiliates, a national, full solution
records and information-management company, in a cash transaction for a purchase price of approximately $191,000. Included in the purchase price is approximately $9,000 held in escrow to secure
indemnification obligations and certain working capital adjustments.

other payments of $132 and $76, respectively related to acquisitions made in the current and previous years.

(2)

Consists
primarily of racking structures, leasehold improvements and computer hardware and software.

(3)

The
weighted average lives of customer relationship assets associated with acquisitions in 2011, 2012 and 2013 was 20 years, 17 years and
22 years, respectively.

(4)

Consists
primarily of accounts payable, accrued expenses, notes payable, deferred revenue and deferred income taxes.

Allocations
of the purchase price for acquisitions completed in 2013 were based on estimates of the fair value of net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment. We are not aware of
any information that would indicate that the final purchase price allocations will differ meaningfully from preliminary estimates. The purchase price allocations of the 2013 acquisitions are subject
to finalization of the assessment of the fair value of intangible assets (primarily customer relationship assets), property, plant and equipment (primarily racking structures), operating leases,
contingencies and income taxes (primarily deferred income taxes).

As
of December 31, 2012 and 2013, we have reclassified approximately $123,946 and $26,916, respectively, of long-term deferred income tax liabilities to current deferred income
taxes (included within accrued expenses within current liabilities) and prepaid and other assets (included within current assets) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the
depreciation recapture associated with our characterization of certain racking structures as real estate rather than personal property and amortization associated with other intangible assets in
conjunction with our potential conversion to a REIT.

We
have federal net operating loss carryforwards, which expire in 2021 through 2033, of $70,329 ($24,615, tax effected) at December 31, 2013 to reduce future federal taxable
income. We have assets for state net operating losses of $2,738 (net of federal tax benefit), which expire in 2014 through 2025, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 45%. We have assets
for foreign net operating losses of $53,771, with various expiration dates (and in some cases no expiration date), subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 72%. We also have foreign tax
credits of $10,229, which will begin to expire in 2024.

We
receive a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options or upon the disqualifying disposition by employees of incentive stock options and certain shares acquired
under our ESPP for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise or disqualifying disposition. The tax benefit for non-qualified
stock options is included in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which compensation expense is recorded. The tax benefit associated with compensation expense recorded in the
consolidated financial statements related to incentive stock options is recorded in the period the disqualifying disposition occurs. All tax benefits for awards issued prior to January 1, 2003
and incremental tax benefits in excess of compensation expense recorded in the consolidated financial statements are credited directly to equity and amounted to $919, $1,045 and $2,389 for the years

Our
effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 were 30.2%, 38.5% and 38.7%, respectively. Our effective tax rate is subject to variability in the
future due to, among other items: (1) changes in the mix of income from foreign jurisdictions; (2) tax law changes; (3) volatility in foreign exchange gains (losses);
(4) the timing of the establishment and reversal of tax reserves; (5) our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and net operating losses that we generate; and (6) our proposed
REIT conversion. The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 were the impact from the
repatriation discussed below, which increased our 2013 effective tax rate by 13.1%, and state income taxes (net of federal tax benefit). These expenses were partially offset by a favorable impact
provided by the



IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

7. Income Taxes (Continued)

recognition
of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits due to expirations of statute of limitation periods and settlements with tax authorities in various jurisdictions and differences in the
rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. The primary reconciling items between the
federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 were differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including
foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates and state income taxes (net of federal tax benefit). During the year ended December 31, 2012, foreign
currency gains were recorded in lower tax jurisdictions associated with our marking-to-market of intercompany loan positions while foreign currency losses were recorded in higher tax jurisdictions
associated with our marking-to-market of debt and derivative instruments, which lowered our 2012 effective tax rate by 2.2%. The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and
our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 was a favorable impact provided by the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits due to expirations of
statute of limitation periods and settlements with tax authorities in various jurisdictions and differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange
gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. This benefit was partially offset by state income taxes (net of federal tax benefit). Additionally, to a lesser extent, a goodwill
impairment charge included in income from continuing operations as a component of intangible impairments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, of which a majority was non-deductible for tax
purposes, is a reconciling item that impacts our effective tax rate.

During
2013, we completed a plan to utilize both current and carryforward foreign tax credits by repatriating approximately $252,700 (approximately $65,200 of which was previously
subject to U.S. taxes) from our foreign earnings. Due to uncertainty in our ability to fully utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards, we previously did not recognize a full benefit for such foreign
tax credit carryforwards in
our tax provision. As a result, we recorded an increase in our tax provision from continuing operations in the amount of $63,504 in 2013. This increase was offset by decreases of $18,753 from current
year foreign tax credits and $23,301 reversal of valuation allowances related to foreign tax credit carryforwards, resulting in a net increase of $21,450 in our tax provision from continuing
operations.

After
the repatriation, we have a net tax over book outside basis difference related to our foreign subsidiaries. We do not expect this net basis difference to reverse in the foreseeable
future and we intend to reinvest any future undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the U.S. We have instances where we have book over tax outside basis differences
for certain foreign subsidiaries. These basis differences arose primarily through undistributed book earnings of such foreign subsidiaries of $52,103 and could be reversed through a sale of such
foreign subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from such subsidiaries or certain other events or actions on our part, each of which would result in an increase in our provision for income taxes. It is
not practicable to calculate the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these book over tax outside basis differences because of the complexities of the hypothetical calculation. We may
record additional deferred taxes on book over tax outside basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries in the future depending upon a number of factors, decisions and events in connection
with our potential conversion to a REIT, including favorable indications from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") with regard to our private letter ruling requests, finalization of countries
to be included in our plan to convert to a REIT,

shareholder
approval of certain modifications to our corporate charter and final board of director approval of our conversion to a REIT.

On
January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the "ATRA") was signed into law. In part, the ATRA retroactively reinstated and extended the controlled foreign
corporation look-through rule, which provides for the exception from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013 of certain foreign earnings from U.S. federal taxation as Subpart F
income. As a result, our income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 included a discrete tax benefit of $4,025 relating to the previously expired period from January 1, 2012 to
December 31, 2012.

On
September 13, 2013, the IRS released final tangible property regulations under Sections 162(a) and 263(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), regarding
the deduction and capitalization of expenditures related to tangible property. The final regulations replace temporary regulations that were issued in December 2011. Also released were proposed
regulations under Section 168 of the Code regarding dispositions of tangible property. These final and proposed regulations will be effective for our tax year beginning on January 1,
2014. Early adoption is available, and as such, we intend to elect early adoption of the regulations. Changes for tax treatment elected by us or required by the regulations will generally be effective
prospectively; however, implementation of many of the regulations' provisions will require a calculation of the cumulative effect of the changes on prior years, and it is expected that such amount
will have to be included in the determination of our taxable
income over a four-year period beginning in 2013. Transition guidance providing the procedural rules to comply with such regulations is expected to be released in the near term. We do not believe
these regulations will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

The
evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a measurement process whereby
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the
largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

We
have elected to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Operations. We recorded a decrease of $(8,477), an increase of $1,257 and an increase of $1,459 for gross interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and
2013, respectively. We had $3,554 and $4,874 accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

The
normal statute of limitations for U.S. federal tax purposes is three years from the date the tax return is filed. The 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax years remain subject to
examination for U.S. federal tax purposes as well as net operating loss carryforwards utilized in these years. We utilized net operating losses from 1998, 1999, and 2000 in our federal income tax
returns for these tax years. The normal statute of limitations for state purposes is between three to five years. However, certain of our state statute of limitations remain open for periods longer
than this when audits are in progress.

We
are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have business
operations or a taxable presence. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2012 and 2013,
we had $37,563 and $51,146, respectively, of reserves related to uncertain tax positions included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although we believe
our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates.

believe that it is reasonably possible that an amount up to approximately $2,800 of our unrecognized tax positions may be recognized by the end of 2014 as a result of a lapse of statute of limitations
or upon closing and settling significant audits in various worldwide jurisdictions.

costs and certain asset write-downs associated with facility consolidations and other asset impairments, (2) $6,400 in legal fees and reserves and $4,000 in professional fees associated with

The
change in net income (loss) attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2013 is primarily
attributable to a benefit for income taxes recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to a provision recorded in the third quarter of 2013 for a net benefit of approximately $50,200 as well as a
decrease in other expenses, net of approximately $34,700 primarily as a result of debt extinguishment charges recorded in the third quarter of 2013 of approximately $43,600 that did not repeat in the
fourth quarter of 2013 offset by an increase in foreign exchange transaction losses of approximately $11,000. Offsetting these benefits was a decrease in operating income of approximately $42,900. The
decrease in operating income is primarily attributable to: (1) $18,700 of restructuring costs associated with our organizational realignment, (2) $11,200 of facilities costs primarily
associated with facility consolidation, (3) $8,100 of other cost increases, including costs associated with recent acquisitions and executing our strategy, (4) $3,600 of increased
depreciation and amortization, primarily related to business acquisitions, (5) $3,000 in sales, marketing and account management costs within our North American Business segment (primarily
associated with sales commissions), (6) $2,200 of increased bad debt expense and (7) $2,000 of charitable contributions, partially offset by a $7,100 decrease in REIT Costs (defined at
Note 9) incurred in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2013.

Corporate—consists of costs related to executive and staff functions, including finance, human resources and
information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. These costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of
programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. Corporate also includes stock-based employee
compensation expense associated with all Employee Stock-Based Awards.

9. Segment Information (Continued)

The
accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 2. Adjusted OIBDA for each segment is defined as operating income before depreciation,
amortization, intangible
impairments, (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net and REIT Costs (defined below) directly attributable to the segment. Internally, we use Adjusted OIBDA as the
basis for evaluating the performance of, and allocating resources to, our operating segments.

A
reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to income from continuing operations before provision (benefit) for income taxes on a consolidated basis is as follows:

10. Commitments and Contingencies

a.

Leases

Most
of our leased facilities are leased under various operating leases that typically have initial lease terms of five to ten years. A majority of these leases have renewal options with
one or more five year options to extend and may have fixed or Consumer Price Index escalation clauses. We also lease equipment under operating leases (primarily computers) which have an average lease
life of three years. Vehicles and office equipment are also leased and have remaining lease lives ranging from one to seven years. Total rent expense (including common area maintenance charges) under
all of our operating leases was $242,954, $250,986 and $244,390 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Included in total rent expense was sublease income of $2,974,
$3,407 and $3,109 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

Estimated
minimum future lease payments (excluding common area maintenance charges) include payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew results in an
economic disincentive due to significant capital expenditure costs (e.g., racking structures), thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease. Such payments in effect at
December 31, are as follows:

2016, 2017, 2018 and thereafter, respectively.

b.

Self-Insured
Liabilities

We
are self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers' compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under
employee healthcare and short-term disability programs. At December 31, 2012 and 2013 there were $34,806 and $32,850, respectively, of self-insurance accruals reflected in accrued expenses of
our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We
account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2013

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

10. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

including
those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date.

c.

Litigation—General

We
are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. A portion of the defense and/or settlement costs associated with such litigation is covered by various
commercial liability insurance policies purchased by us and, in limited cases, indemnification from third parties. Our policy is to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the losses are both
probable and reasonably estimable. We record legal costs associated with loss contingencies as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. The matters described below represent our significant
loss contingencies. We have evaluated each matter and, if both probable and estimable, accrued an amount that represents our estimate of any probable loss associated with such matter. In addition, we
have estimated a reasonably possible range for all loss contingencies including those described below. We believe it is reasonably possible that we could incur aggregate losses in addition to amounts
currently accrued for all matters up to an additional $46,500 over the next several years, of which certain amounts would be covered by insurance or indemnity arrangements.

d.     Government
Contract Billing Matter

Since
October 2001, we have provided services to the U.S. Government under several General Services Administration ("GSA") multiple award schedule contracts (the "Schedules"). From
October 1, 2001 through December 31, 2013, we billed approximately $73,100 under the Schedules. The earliest of the Schedules was renewed in October 2006 with certain modifications to
its terms. The Schedules contain a price reductions clause ("Price Reductions Clause") that requires us to offer to reduce the prices billed under the Schedules to correspond to the prices billed to
certain benchmark commercial customers. In 2011, we initiated an internal review covering the contract period commencing in October 2006, and we discovered potential non-compliance with the Price
Reductions Clause. We voluntarily disclosed the potential non-compliance for that period to the GSA and its Office of Inspector General ("OIG") in June 2011.

In
April 2012, the U.S. Government sent us a subpoena seeking information that substantially overlaps with the subjects that are covered by the voluntary disclosure process that we
initiated with the GSA and OIG in June 2011, except that the subpoena seeks information dating back to 2000, including the initial GSA schedule period of 2001 to 2006, and seeks information about
non-GSA federal and state and local customers. Despite the substantial overlap, we understand that the subpoena relates to a separate inquiry, under the civil False Claims Act, that has been initiated
independent of the GSA and OIG voluntary disclosure matter.

We
continue to review this matter and provide the U.S. Government with information, including pricing practices and the proposed pricing adjustment amount to be refunded. The U.S.
Government, however, may not agree with our determination of the refund amount and may request additional pricing adjustments, refunds, civil penalties, up to treble damages and/or interest.

Given
the above, it is reasonably possible that an adjustment to our estimates may be required in the future as a result of updated facts and circumstances. To the extent that an
adjustment to our



IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2013

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

10. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

estimates
is necessary in a future period, we will assess, at that time, whether the adjustment is a result of a change in estimate or the correction of an error. A change in estimate would be
reflected as an adjustment through the then-current period statement of operations. A correction of an error would require a quantitative and qualitative analysis to determine the approach to
correcting the error. A correction of an error could be reflected in the then-current period statement of operations or as a restatement of prior period financial information, depending upon the
underlying facts and circumstances and our quantitative and qualitative analysis.

e.

State
of Massachusetts Assessment

During
the third quarter of 2012, we applied for an abatement of assessments from the state of Massachusetts. The assessments, issued in the second quarter of 2012, related to a
corporate excise audit of the 2004 through 2006 tax years in the aggregate amount of $8,191, including tax, interest and penalties through the assessment date. The applications for abatement were
denied during the third quarter of 2012. On October 19, 2012 we filed petitions with the Massachusetts Appellate Tax Board challenging the assessments. We intend to defend this matter
vigorously at the Massachusetts Appellate Tax Board. In addition, during the second quarter of 2013, Massachusetts assessed tax for the 2007 and 2008 tax years in the aggregate amount of $4,120,
including tax, interest and penalties through the assessment date. The assessment is for issues consistent with those assessed in the earlier years. In the third quarter of 2013, we filed an
application for abatement for the 2007 and 2008 tax years, which Massachusetts denied on October 15, 2013. On December 13, 2013, we filed a petition with the Massachusetts Appellate Tax
Board to challenge the assessment for the 2007 and 2008 tax years and will vigorously defend the matter. Additionally, the state is auditing us for the 2009-2011 tax years.

f.

Italy
Fire

On
November 4, 2011, we experienced a fire at a facility we leased in Aprilia, Italy. The facility primarily stored archival and inactive business records for local area
businesses. Despite quick response by local fire authorities, damage to the building was extensive, and the building and its contents were a total loss. We continue to assess the impact of the fire,
and, although our warehouse legal liability
insurer has reserved its rights to contest coverage related to certain types of potential claims, we believe we carry adequate insurance. We have been sued by three customers, and all three of those
matters have been settled. We have also received correspondence from other customers, under various theories of liabilities. We deny any liability with respect to the fire and we have referred these
claims to our warehouse legal liability insurer for an appropriate response. We do not expect that this event will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows. As discussed in Note 14, we sold our Italian operations on April 27, 2012, and we indemnified the buyers related to certain obligations and contingencies associated with
the fire.



IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2013

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

10. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

Our policy related to business interruption insurance recoveries is to record gains within other (income) expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and proceeds received
within cash flows from operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Such amounts are recorded in the period the cash is received. Our policy with respect to involuntary
conversion of property, plant and equipment is to record any gain or loss within (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net within operating income in our Consolidated
Statements of Operations and proceeds received within cash flows from investing activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Losses are recorded when incurred and gains are recorded in
the period when the cash received exceeds the carrying value of the related property, plant and equipment. As a result of the sale of the Italian operations, statements of operation and cash flow
impacts related to the fire will be reflected as discontinued operations.

11. Related Party Transactions

We formerly leased space to an affiliated company, Schooner Capital LLC ("Schooner"), for its corporate headquarters located in Boston, Massachusetts until February 6,
2014. For the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, Schooner paid rent to us totaling $188, $196 and $194, respectively. One of the members of our board of directors and several of his family members held an
indirect equity interest in one of the stockholders that received proceeds in connection with the acquisition of our joint venture in Poland. As a result of this equity interest, such board member,
together with several of his family members, received approximately 24% of the purchase price that we paid in connection with this transaction. See Note 6.

Paul
F. Deninger, one of our directors, is a senior managing director at Evercore Group L.L.C. ("Evercore"). In May 2013, we entered into an agreement with Evercore, which was amended
and restated in August 2013 (the "Evercore Engagement"), pursuant to which Evercore agreed to provide financial advisory services to us in exchange for an aggregate fee of up to $3,000 (the
"Engagement Fees"). In connection with the Evercore Engagement, Mr. Deninger agreed, and Evercore represented, that Mr. Deninger would not be involved with the Evercore Engagement and
would not receive any fees or direct compensation in connection with the Evercore Engagement. The Evercore Engagement was approved by the audit committee of our board of directors in accordance with
our Related Persons Transaction Policy. As of December 31, 2013, we have incurred $2,750 of fees associated with the Evercore Engagement, including fees associated with the amendment of our
Credit Agreement in August 2013 and discounts and commissions attributable to Evercore's participation as one of the underwriters in the August 2013 Offerings, as well as monthly retention fees.

12. 401(k) Plans

We have a defined contribution plan, which generally covers all non-union U.S. employees meeting certain service requirements. Eligible employees may elect to defer from 1% to 25% of
compensation per pay period up to the amount allowed by the Code. In addition, Iron Mountain Europe (Group) Limited operates a defined contribution plan, which is similar to the U.S.'s 401(k) Plan. We
make matching contributions based on the amount of an employee's contribution in accordance with the plan

documents.
We have expensed $18,133, $18,026 and $19,999 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

13. Stockholders' Equity Matters

Our board of directors has authorized up to $1,200,000 in repurchases of our common stock. All repurchases are subject to stock price, market conditions, corporate and legal requirements
and other factors. As of December 31, 2013, we had a remaining amount available for repurchase under our share repurchase program of $66,035, which represents approximately 1% in the aggregate
of our outstanding common stock based on the closing stock price on such date.

In
February 2010, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we have paid, and in the future intend to pay, quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Declaration
and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors. We may pay certain distributions in the form of cash and common stock if we are successful in converting to a
REIT. In 2012 and 2013, our board of directors declared the following dividends:

In
December 2013, our board of directors approved, and we entered into, a REIT Protection Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement") which provides for a dividend of one preferred stock
purchase right (a "Right") for each share of our common stock outstanding on December 20, 2013. Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from us one one-thousandth of a share of our
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for a purchase price of $114.00, subject to adjustment as provided in the Rights Agreement and our Amended Certificate of Designations for our
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, each of which was filed with the SEC on December 9, 2013, on a Current Report on Form 8-K. We anticipate that we will seek
stockholder approval to impose ownership limitations in our charter documents, as is customary for REITs, if we are ultimately successful in converting to a REIT. The Rights Agreement is intended to
help protect our potential status as a REIT under the Code until the approval of those ownership limitations by our stockholders, or, if earlier, until the Rights expire, which will be no later than
December 9, 2014.

On
October 11, 2012, we announced the declaration by our board of directors of a special dividend of $700,000 (the "Special Dividend"), payable, at the election of the
stockholders, in either common stock or cash to stockholders of record as of October 22, 2012 (the "Record Date"). The Special

13. Stockholders' Equity Matters (Continued)

Dividend,
which is a distribution to stockholders of a portion of our accumulated earnings and profits, was paid in a combination of common stock and cash. The Special Dividend was paid on
November 21, 2012 (the "Distribution Date") to stockholders as of the Record Date. Stockholders elected to be paid their pro rata portion of the Special Dividend in all common stock or cash.
The total amount of cash paid to all stockholders associated with the Special Dividend was approximately $140,000 (including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares). Our shares of common stock were
valued for purposes of the Special Dividend based upon the average closing price on the three trading days following November 14, 2012, or $32.87 per share, and as such, the number of shares of
common stock we issued in the Special Dividend was approximately 17,000,000 and the total amount of common stock paid to all stockholders associated with the Special Dividend was approximately
$560,000. These shares impact weighted average shares outstanding from the date of issuance, thus impacting our earnings per share data prospectively from the Distribution Date.

14. Discontinued Operations

Digital Operations

On June 2, 2011, we sold the Digital Business to Autonomy pursuant to the Digital Sale Agreement. In the Digital Sale, Autonomy
purchased (1) the shares of certain of IMI's subsidiaries through which we conducted the Digital Business and (2) certain assets of IMI and its subsidiaries relating to the Digital
Business. The Digital Sale qualified as discontinued operations and, as a result, the financial position, operating results and cash flows of the Digital Business, for all periods presented, including
the gain on the sale, have been reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes.

Pursuant
to the Digital Sale Agreement, IMI received approximately $395,400 in cash, consisting of the initial purchase price and a working capital adjustment. Transaction costs relating
to the Digital Sale amounted to $7,387. Additionally, $11,075 of inducements payable to Autonomy have been netted against the proceeds in calculating the gain on the Digital Sale. Also, a tax
provision of $45,126 associated with the gain recorded on the Digital Sale was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2011. A gain on sale of discontinued operations in the amount of $243,861
($198,735, net of tax) was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2011, as a result of the Digital Sale. Approximately $3,828 of cumulative translation adjustment associated with our
Digital Business was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive items, net and reduced the gain on the Digital Sale by the same amount.

Includes
the results of operations of our Digital Business through June 2, 2011, the date the Digital Sale was consummated.

There
have been no allocations of corporate general and administrative expenses to discontinued operations. In accordance with our policy, we have allocated corporate interest associated
with all debt that is not specifically allocated to a particular component based on the proportion of the assets of the Digital Business to our total consolidated assets at the applicable weighted
average interest rate associated with such debt for such reporting period. Interest allocated to the Digital Business included in loss from discontinued operations amounted to $2,396 for the year
ended December 31, 2011.

New Zealand Operations

We completed the sale of our New Zealand operations on October 3, 2011 for a purchase price of approximately $10,000. During the
second quarter of 2011, we recorded an impairment charge of $4,900 to write-down the long-lived assets of our New Zealand operations to its estimated net realizable value, which is included in income
(loss) from discontinued operations. In the calculation of the carrying value of our New Zealand operations, we allocated the goodwill of our Australia/New Zealand reporting unit between Australia and
New Zealand on a relative fair value basis. Additionally, we recorded a tax benefit of $7,883 during the year ended December 31, 2011 associated with the outside tax basis of our New Zealand
operations, which is also reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations. No valuation allowance was provided against this benefit as such amount is recoverable against the capital gain
associated with the Digital Sale. We recorded a gain on the sale of discontinued operations associated with our New Zealand operations of $1,884 during the fourth quarter of 2011 which primarily
represents cumulative translation adjustment associated with our New Zealand operations which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive items, net and increased the gain on the sale of New
Zealand by that same amount. Our New Zealand operations were previously included within the International Business segment. For all periods presented, the

Italian Operations

We sold our Italian operations on April 27, 2012, and we agreed to indemnify the buyers of our Italian operations for certain
possible obligations and contingencies associated with the fire in Italy discussed more fully in Note 10.f. We recorded a loss on sale of discontinued operations in the amount of $1,885 during
the year ended December 31, 2012 as a result of the sale of our Italian operations. Approximately $383 of cumulative translation adjustment associated with our Italian operations was
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive items, net and reduced the loss on the sale by the same amount. We allocated the goodwill of our Continental Western European reporting unit between
our Italian operations and the remainder of this reporting
unit on a relative fair value basis. During the third quarter of 2011, we recorded an impairment charge of $17,100 to write down the long-lived assets of our Italian operations to its estimated net
realizable value, which is included in loss from discontinued operations. Our Italian operations were previously included within the International Business segment. For all periods presented, the
financial position, operating results and cash flows of our Italian operations, including the loss on the sale, have been reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes.

Includes
the results of operations of Italy through April 27, 2012, the date the sale of our Italian operations was consummated.

During
the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized income before provision for income taxes of discontinued operations of $2,290 and income from discontinued operations, net
of tax of $1,360 associated with our Italian operations. This income primarily represents the recovery of insurance proceeds in excess of carrying value.

15. Restructuring

In the third quarter of 2013, we implemented a plan that calls for certain organizational realignments to advance our growth strategy and reduce operating costs. As a result, we recorded
restructuring costs of approximately $23,400 in 2013, primarily related to employee severance and associated benefits. Of the total restructuring costs incurred in 2013, $14,800, $3,700 and $4,900 are
reflected in the results of operations of our North American Business, International Business and Corporate segments, respectively. In our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended
December 31, 2013, $20,000 and $3,400 of these restructuring costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and cost of sales, respectively. We expect to incur an additional
$6,900 of employee severance and associated benefit costs in 2014 in connection with this organizational realignment primarily in our North American Business segment. As a result of the restructuring
of our operations late in 2013 and early in 2014, we are evaluating changes to our internal financial reporting to better align our internal reporting to how we will manage our business going forward.
This evaluation could result in changes to our reportable segments and reporting units during 2014.

16. Subsequent Events

In January 2014, we redeemed the 150,000 British pounds sterling (approximately $248,000) in aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 7


/


% Notes at 100% of par, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, utilizing borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and cash on-hand.

During
the first quarter of 2014, in order to further enhance our international operations, we acquired, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $39,600, Tape Management
Services Pty Ltd, a data management company with operations in Australia, and RM Arsiv Yönetim Hizmetleri Ticaret Anonim Sirketi, a records and
information management company with operations in Turkey.

In
January 2014, in conjunction with a facility consolidation plan, we disposed of two facilities in the United Kingdom which resulted in net cash proceeds of approximately $16,500. We
will record a gain of approximately $9,300 within (gain)/loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net in the first quarter of 2014 as a result of these dispositions.

On
February 5, 2014, we experienced a fire at a facility we own in Buenos Aires, Argentina. As a result of the quick response by local fire authorities, the fire was contained
before the entire facility was destroyed and all employees were safely evacuated; however, a number of first responders lost their lives, or in some cases, were severely injured. The cause of the fire
is currently being investigated. We believe we carry adequate insurance and are in the process of assessing the impact of the fire but do not expect that this event will have a material impact to our
consolidated financial condition. Revenues from our operations at this facility represent less than 0.5% of our consolidated revenues.
