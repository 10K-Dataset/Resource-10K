CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

We have made statements in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K that constitute “forward-looking
statements” as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements
concern our operations, economic performance, financial condition, goals,
beliefs, future growth strategies, investments objectives, plans and current
expectations. The forward-looking statements are subject to various known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. When we use words such as “believes,”
“expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates” or similar expressions, we are making
forward-looking statements.

Although
we believe that our forward-looking statements are based on reasonable
assumptions, our expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may
differ materially from our expectations. Important factors that could cause
actual results to differ from expectations include, among others:

·

changes in customer
preferences and demand for our services;

·

changes in the price for
our services relative to the cost of providing such services;

·

in the various digital
businesses in which we are engaged, capital and technical requirements will be
beyond our means, markets for our services will be less robust than
anticipated, or competition will be more intense than anticipated;

·

the cost to comply with
current and future legislation or regulation relating to privacy issues;

·

the impact of litigation
that may arise in connection with incidents of inadvertent disclosures of
customers’ confidential information;

·

our ability or inability to
complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms and to integrate acquired companies
efficiently;

·

the cost and availability
of financing for contemplated growth;

·

business partners upon whom
we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise
outside the U.S. will not perform as anticipated;

·

changes in the political
and economic environments in the countries in which our international
subsidiaries operate; and

·

other trends in competitive
or economic conditions affecting our financial condition or results of
operations not presently contemplated.

Other risks may adversely
impact us, as described more fully under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

You should not rely upon
forward-looking statements except as statements of our present intentions and
of our present expectations, which may or may not occur. You should read these
cautionary statements as being applicable to all forward-looking statements
wherever they appear. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to
release publicly the result of any revision to these forward-looking statements
that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to
reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Readers are also urged to
carefully review and consider the various disclosures we have made in this
document, as well as our other periodic reports filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “Commission” or “SEC”).

PART I

Item 1. Business.

A. Development of
Business.

We believe we are the global leader in information
protection and storage services. We help organizations around the world reduce
the costs and risks associated with information protection and storage. We
offer comprehensive records management and data protection solutions, along
with the expertise and experience to address complex information challenges
such as rising storage costs, litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster
recovery. Founded in 1951, Iron Mountain is a trusted partner to more than
90,000 corporate clients throughout North America, Europe, Latin America and
Asia Pacific. We have a diversified customer base comprised of commercial,
legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government
organizations, including more than 90% of the Fortune 1000 and more than 85% of
the FTSE 100.

Our information protection and storage services can be
broadly divided into three major service categories:  records management, data protection &
recovery, and information destruction. We offer both physical services and
technology solutions in each of these categories, and we continue to expand our
geographic footprint in order to protect and store our customers’ information
without regard to media format or geographic location.

Our physical records management services include:
records management program development and implementation based on
best-practices to help customers comply with specific regulatory requirements,
implementation of policy-based programs that feature secure, cost-effective
storage for all major media, including paper (which is the dominant form of
records storage), flexible retrieval access and retention management. Our
technology-based records management services are comprised primarily of digital
archiving and related services for secure, legally compliant and cost-effective
long-term archiving of electronic records. Within the records management
services category, we have developed specialized services for vital records and
regulated industries such as healthcare, energy and financial services.

Our physical data protection & recovery
services include disaster preparedness, planning, support and secure, off-site
vaulting of data backup media for fast and efficient data recovery in the event
of a disaster, human error or virus. Our technology-based data protection &
recovery services include online backup and recovery solutions (also known as
electronic vaulting) for desktop and laptop computers and remote servers. Additionally,
we serve as a trusted, neutral third party and offer technology escrow services
to protect and manage source code and other proprietary information.

Our information destruction services are comprised
almost exclusively of secure shredding services. Secure shredding services
complete the life cycle of a record and involve the shredding of sensitive
documents in a way that ensures privacy and a secure chain of record custody. These
services typically include the scheduled pick-up of loose office records which
customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide. Our
technology-based information destruction services include DataDefense, which
provides automatic, intelligent encryption of sensitive PC data and, when
behaviors that are inconsistent with authorized use are detected, that data is
automatically eliminated and the PC is disabled—this is designed to render the
data useless to unauthorized users.

In addition to our core records management, data
protection & recovery, and information destruction services, we sell
storage materials, including cardboard boxes and magnetic media, and provide
consulting, facilities management, fulfillment and other outsourcing services.

Our vision is to protect and store the world’s
information and to that end we have organized our business into a geographic
model with separate management teams for each of the following major geographic
regions:  North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. The one
exception to this


model is our Digital
Services business unit. Digital services, by their nature, are deployed in a
virtual fashion leveraging a common set of intellectual property and a global
technology infrastructure. Our largest segment, the North American Physical
Business, offers all of our physical records management services, data
protection & recovery services, and information destruction services. We
expect that over time all of these products and services will be available on a
global basis throughout all of our geographic segments.

Iron Mountain was founded in 1951 in an underground
facility near Hudson, New York. Now in our 56

th year, we have experienced
tremendous growth and organizational change, particularly since successfully
completing the initial public offering of our common stock in February 1996.
Since then, we have grown from a regional business with limited product
offerings and annual revenues of $104 million in 1995 into a global
enterprise providing a broad range of information protection and storage
services to customers in markets around the world. For the year ended December 31,
2006, we had total revenues of $2.4 billion.

Our growth since 1995 has been accomplished primarily
through the acquisition of U.S. and international information protection and
storage services companies. The goals of our current acquisition program
are:  to supplement internal growth in
our physical businesses by continuing to establish a footprint in targeted
international markets and adding fold-in acquisitions both in the U.S. and
internationally; and to accelerate our strategy, leadership and time to market
in our digital businesses. We expect our digital acquisitions will be of two
primary types, those that bring us new or improved technologies to enhance our
existing technology portfolio and those that increase our market position
through technology and established revenue streams. To date, we completed two
significant technology acquisitions: 
Connected Corporation (“Connected”) in November 2004 and LiveVault
Corporation (“LiveVault”) in December 2005.

Having substantially completed our North American
geographic expansion by the end of 2000, we shifted our focus from growth
through acquisitions to internal revenue growth. In 2001, as a result of this
shift, internal revenue growth exceeded growth through acquisitions for the
first time since we began our acquisition program in 1996.This has been the
case in each year since 2001 with the exception of 2004, when revenue growth
from acquisitions exceeded internal revenue growth due primarily to the
acquisition of the records management operations of Hays plc (“Hays IMS”) in July 2003.
In the absence of unusual acquisition activity, we expect to achieve most of
our revenue growth internally in 2007 and beyond.

We expect to achieve our internal revenue growth
objectives primarily through a sophisticated sales and account management
coverage model designed to drive incremental revenues by acquiring new customer
relationships and increasing business with new and existing customers by
selling them our products and services in new geographies and selling
additional products and services such as secure shredding and digital data
protection. These selling efforts will be augmented and supported by an
expanded marketing program, which includes product management as a core
discipline. We are also developing an extensive worldwide network of channel
partners through which we are selling a wide array of technology solutions,
primarily our digital data protection and recovery products and services.

As of December 31,
2006, we provided services to over 90,000 corporate clients in 85 markets in
the U.S. and 86 markets outside of the U.S., employed over 18,600 people and
operated over 900 records management facilities in the U.S., Canada, Europe,
Latin America and Asia Pacific.


B. Description of
Business.

The Information
Protection and Storage Services Industry

Overview

Companies in the
information protection and storage services industry store and manage
information in a variety of media formats, which can broadly be divided into
physical and electronic records, and provide a wide range of services related
to the records stored. We define physical records to include paper documents,
as well as all other non-electronic media such as microfilm and microfiche,
master audio and videotapes, film, X-rays and blueprints. Electronic records
include various forms of magnetic media such as computer tapes and hard drives
and optical disks.

Physical Records

Physical records may be
broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. Active records relate
to ongoing and recently completed activities or contain information that is
frequently referenced. Active records are usually stored and managed on-site by
the organization that originated them to ensure ready availability. Inactive
physical records are the principal focus of the information protection and
storage services industry. Inactive records consist of those records that are
not needed for immediate access but which must be retained for legal,
regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of
ongoing business operations. A large and growing specialty subset of the
physical records market is medical records. These are active and semi-active
records that are often stored off-site with and serviced by an information
protection and storage services vendor. Special regulatory requirements often
apply to medical records.

Electronic Records

Electronic records management focuses on the storage
of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of
recently processed data or archival in nature. Customer needs for data backup
and recovery and archiving are distinctively different. Backup data exists
because of the need of many businesses to maintain backup copies of their data
in order to be able to recover the data in the event of a system failure,
casualty loss or other disaster. It is customary (and a best practice) for data
processing groups to rotate backup tapes to off-site locations on a regular
basis and to require multiple copies of such information at multiple sites.

In addition to the physical rotation and storage of
backup data that our physical business segments provide, our Worldwide Digital
Business segment offers electronic vaulting services as an alternative way for
businesses to transfer data to us, and to access the data they have stored with
us. Electronic vaulting is a Web-based service that automatically backs up
computer data from servers or directly from desktop and laptop computers over
the Internet and stores it in one of our secure data centers. In early 2003, we
announced an expansion of the electronic vaulting service to include backup and
recovery for personal computer data, answering customers’ needs to protect
critical business data, which is often unprotected on employee laptop and
desktop personal computers. In November 2004, we acquired Connected, a
market leader in the backup and recovery of this distributed data, and in December 2005,
we acquired LiveVault, a market leader in the backup and recovery of server
data.

There is a growing need for better ways of archiving
electronic records for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons and for
occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. Historically,
businesses have relied on backup tapes for storing archived data in electronic
format, but this process can be costly and ineffective when attempting to
search and retrieve the data for litigation or other needs. In addition, many
industries, such as healthcare and financial services, are facing increased
governmental regulation mandating the way in which electronic records are
stored and managed. To help customers


meet these growing storage
challenges, we introduced digital archiving services. We have experienced
increasing market adoption of these services, especially for e-mail archiving,
which enables businesses to identify and retrieve electronic records quickly
and cost-effectively, while maintaining regulatory compliance.

We believe the issues
encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar
to the ones they face in their physical records management programs and consist
primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access
to and control over the data in a secure environment; and (3) the need to
retain electronic records due to regulatory compliance or for litigation
support. Our digital services offerings are representative of our commitment to
address evolving records management needs and expand the array of services we
offer.

Growth of Market

We believe that the volume of stored physical and
electronic records will continue to increase for a number of reasons,
including: (1) inexpensive document producing technologies such as
facsimile, desktop publishing software and desktop printing; (2) the
continued proliferation of data processing technologies such as personal
computers and networks; (3) regulatory requirements; (4) concerns
over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and
holding periods of records; (5) the high cost of reviewing records and
deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many
entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and (7) audit
requirements to keep backup copies of certain records in off-site locations.

We believe that
paper-based information will continue to grow, not in spite of, but because of,
new “paperless” technologies such as e-mail and the Internet. These
technologies have prompted the creation of hard copies of such electronic
information and have also led to increased demand for electronic records
services, such as the storage and off-site rotation of backup copies of
magnetic media. In addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital
information technologies and distributed data networks has created a growing
need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality technology solutions for
electronic data protection, digital archiving and the management of electronic
documents.

Consolidation of a
Highly Fragmented Industry

There was significant consolidation within the highly
fragmented information protection and storage services industry in North
America from 1995 to 2000 and at a slower but continuing pace in recent years.
Most information protection and storage services companies serve a single local
market, and are often either owner-operated or ancillary to another business,
such as a moving and storage company. We believe that the consolidation trend,
both in North America and other regions, will continue because of the industry’s
capital requirements for growth, opportunities for large information protection
and storage services providers to achieve economies of scale and customer
demands for more sophisticated technology-based solutions.

We believe that the
consolidation trend in the industry is also due to, and will continue as a
result of, the preference of certain large organizations to contract with one
vendor in multiple cities and countries for multiple services. In particular,
customers increasingly demand a single, large, sophisticated company to handle
all of their important physical and electronic records needs. Large national
and multinational companies are better able to satisfy these demands than
smaller competitors. We have made, and intend to continue to make, acquisitions
of our competitors, many of whom are small, single-city operators.

Description of Our
Business

We generate our revenues by providing storage for both
physical and electronic records in a variety of information media formats, core
records management, data protection & recovery, and information


destruction services and
an expanding menu of complementary products and services to a large and diverse
customer base. Providing outsourced information protection and storage services
is the mainstay of our customer relationships and provides the foundation for
our revenue growth. Core services, which are a vital part of a comprehensive
records management program, consist primarily of the handling and
transportation of stored records and information. In our secure shredding
operations, core services consist primarily of the scheduled collection and
handling of sensitive records.  As is the
case with storage revenues, core service revenues are highly recurring in
nature and therefore very predictable. In 2006, our storage and core service
revenues represented approximately 87% of our total consolidated revenues. In
addition to our core services, we offer a wide array of complementary products
and services such as performing special project work, selling records
management services related products, providing fulfillment services and
consulting on records management issues. These services address more specific
needs and are designed to enhance our customers’ overall records management
programs. These services complement our core services; however, they are more
episodic and discretionary in nature. Revenue generated by all of our operating
segments includes both core and complementary components.

Our various operating
segments offer the products and services discussed below. In general, our North
American Physical Business segment offers physical records management services,
including business records management, healthcare information services, vital
records services, physical data protection & recovery services,
service and courier operations, secure shredding, fulfillment and consulting
services, in the U.S. and Canada. Our International Physical Business segment
offers elements of our physical product and services lines outside the U.S. and
Canada. Our Worldwide Digital Business segment includes our online backup and
recovery solutions for server data and personal computers, digital archiving
services, intellectual property management services and electronic information
destruction services. Some of our complementary services and products are
offered within all of our segments. The amount of revenues derived from our
North American Physical Business, International Physical Business and Worldwide
Digital Business operating segments and other relevant data, including
financial information about geographic areas and product and service lines, for
fiscal years 2004, 2005 and 2006 are set forth in Note 9 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business Records
Management

The hard copy business
records stored by our customers with us by their nature are not very active.
These types of records are stored in cartons packed by the customer. We use a
proprietary order processing and inventory management system known as the

SafekeeperPLUS

® system to efficiently
store and later retrieve a customer’s cartons. Storage charges are generally
billed monthly on a per storage unit basis, usually either per carton or per
cubic foot of records, and include the provision of space, racking,
computerized inventory and activity tracking and physical security.

Healthcare
Information Services

Healthcare information
services principally include the handling, storage, filing, processing and
retrieval of medical records used by hospitals, private practitioners and other
medical institutions. Medical records tend to be more active in nature and are
typically stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide easier
access to individual files. Healthcare information services also include
recurring project work and ancillary services. Recurring project work involves
the on-site removal of aged patient files and related computerized file
indexing. Ancillary healthcare information services include release of
information (medical record copying), temporary staffing, contract coding,
facilities management and imaging.


Vital Records
Services

Vital records contain
critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film
and other highly proprietary information. Vital records may require special
facilities or services, either because of the data they contain or the media on
which they are recorded. Our charges for providing enhanced security and
special climate-controlled environments for vital records are higher than for
typical storage services. We provide the same ancillary services for vital
records as we provide for our other storage operations.

Physical Data
Protection & Recovery Services

Physical data protection &
recovery services consist of the storage and rotation of backup computer media
as part of corporate disaster recovery and business continuity plans. Computer
tapes, cartridges and disk packs are transported off-site by our courier
operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where
they are available to customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to facilitate
data recovery in the event of a disaster. We use various proprietary
information technology systems such as

MediaLink

™
and

SecureBase

™ software to
manage this process. We also manage tape library relocations and support
disaster recovery testing and execution.

Service and Courier
Operations

Service and courier operations are an integral part of
a comprehensive records management program for all physical media including
paper and certain electronic records. They include adding records to storage, temporary
removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, permanent
withdrawals from storage, destruction of records and the rotation of back-up
computer media. Service charges are generally assessed for each procedure on a
per unit basis. The

SafekeeperPLUS

®
system controls the service processes from order entry through transportation
and invoicing for business records management while the

MediaLink

™ and

SecureBase

™ systems manage the process for the physical
data protection services business.

Courier operations consist
primarily of the pick-up and delivery of records upon customer request. Charges
for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location and
are billed monthly. As of December 31, 2006, we were utilizing a fleet of
approximately 3,000 owned or leased vehicles.

Secure Shredding

Secure shredding is a natural extension of our records
management services, completing the life cycle of a record, and involves the
shredding of sensitive documents for corporate customers that, in many cases,
also use our services for management of less sensitive archival records. These
services typically include the scheduled pick-up of loose office records which
customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide. We
believe that customers are motivated by increased privacy regulations, such as
the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act (“FACTA”) and the desire to
protect their proprietary trade secrets and personal information. Regulations
issued pursuant to FACTA list secure shredding as a preferred method of
destroying personal data that exists in many hard copy records. Complementary
to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste paper to
third-party recyclers. Through a combination of plant-based shredding
operations and mobile shredding units comprised of custom built trucks, we are
able to offer secure shredding services to our customers in all of our existing
markets throughout the U.S. and Canada. In December 2005, we acquired
Secure Destruction Limited, the largest provider of secure shredding services
in the U.K.

We seek to expand our
presence in this business through acquisitions and internal start-ups that
leverage our existing records management infrastructure.


Electronic Vaulting
Services

Electronic vaulting is our
Web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or
directly from desktop or laptop computers over the Internet and stores it in
one of our secure data centers. Customers using electronic vaulting for the
online backup of desktop or laptop computer and server data can choose our
off-site hosted Software as a Service solution or they can license the software
from us as part of a customer on-site solution.

Digital Archiving
Services

Our digital archiving services focus on archiving
digital information with long-term preservation requirements. These services
represent the digital analogy to our physical records management services.
Because of increased litigation risks and regulatory mandates, companies are increasingly
aware of the need to apply the same records management policies and retention
schedules to electronic data as they do physical records. Typical digital
records include e-mail, e-statements, images, electronic documents retained for
legal or compliance purposes and other data documenting business transactions.

The growth rate of
mission-critical digital information is accelerating, driven in part by the use
of the Internet as a distribution and transaction medium. The rising cost and
increasing importance of digital information management, coupled with the
increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may
create meaningful opportunities for us. We continue to cultivate marketing and
technology partnerships to support this anticipated growth.

Intellectual
Property Management Services

Our intellectual property
management services specialize in third party technology escrow services that
protect intellectual property assets such as software source code. In addition,
we assist in securing intellectual property as collateral for lending,
investments and joint ventures, in managing domain name registrations and
transfers, and in providing expertise and assistance to brokers and dealers in
complying with electronic records regulations of the SEC.

Complementary
Services and Products

We offer a variety of additional services which
customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. These services
include conducting records inventories, packing records into cartons or other containers,
and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. We also
provide services for the management of active records programs. We can provide
these services, which generally include document and file processing and
storage, both off-site at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel
to perform management functions on-site at the customer’s premises.

Other complementary lines of business that we operate
include fulfillment services and professional consulting services. Fulfillment
services are performed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, COMAC, Inc. (“COMAC”).
COMAC stores customer marketing literature and delivers this material to sales
offices, trade shows and prospective customers’ sites based on current and
prospective customer orders. In addition, COMAC assembles custom marketing
packages and orders, and manages and provides detailed reporting on customer
marketing literature inventories.

We provide professional consulting services to
customers, enabling them to develop and implement comprehensive records and
information management programs. Our consulting business draws on our
experience in information protection and storage services to analyze the
practices of companies and assist them in creating more effective programs of
records and information management. Our consultants work with these customers
to develop policies and schedules for document retention and destruction.


We sell software licenses
to our electronic vaulting customers who prefer an on-site solution for the
online backup and recovery of server and personal computer data. We also sell: (1) a
full line of specially designed corrugated cardboard, metal and plastic storage
containers; (2) magnetic media products including computer tapes,
cartridges and drives, tape cleaners and supplies and CDs; and (3) computer
room equipment and supplies such as racking systems and furniture.

Financial
Characteristics of Our Business

Our financial model
is based on the recurring nature of our various revenue streams. The historical
predictability of our revenues and the resulting operating income before
depreciation and amortization

(“OIBDA”)


allow
us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. Our primary financial
goal has always been, and continues to be, to increase consolidated OIBDA in
relation to capital invested, even as our focus has shifted from growth through
acquisitions to internal revenue growth. Our business has the following
financial characteristics:

·

Recurring Revenues.

We derive a majority of our consolidated
revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, fees charged to customers based
on the volume of records stored. Once a customer places physical records in
storage with us and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed,
for which we typically receive a service fee, we receive recurring payments for
storage fees without incurring additional labor or marketing expenses or
significant capital costs. Similarly, contracts for the storage of electronic
backup media consist primarily of fixed monthly payments. Our quarterly
revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 72 consecutive
quarters.  For each of the five years
2002 through 2006, storage revenues, which are stable and recurring, have
accounted for over 56% of our total consolidated revenues. This stable and
growing storage revenue base also provides the foundation for increases in
service revenues and OIBDA.

·

Historically Non-Cyclical Storage Business.

We have not
experienced any significant reductions in our storage business as a result of
past economic downturns, although we can give no assurance that this would be
the case in the future. We believe that companies that have outsourced records
management services are less likely during economic downturns to incur the
move-out costs and other expenses associated with switching vendors or moving
their records management services programs in-house. However, during a recent
economic slowdown, the rate at which some customers added new cartons to their
inventory was below historical levels. The net effect of these factors has been
the continued growth of our storage revenue base, albeit at a lower rate. For
each of the five years 2002 through 2006, total net volume growth in North
America has ranged between 6% and 7%.

·

Inherent Growth from Existing Physical Records Customers.

Our physical records customers have on average generated additional cartons at
a faster rate than stored cartons have been destroyed or permanently removed.
We estimate that inherent growth from existing customers represents
approximately half of our total net volume growth in North America. We believe
the consistent growth of our physical records storage revenues is the result of
a number of factors, including: (1) the trend toward increased records retention;
(2) customer satisfaction with our services; and (3) the costs and
inconvenience of moving storage operations in-house or to another provider of
information protection and storage services.


For a more
detailed definition and reconciliation of OIBDA and a discussion of why we
believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current
and potential investors, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Measures.”


·

Diversified and Stable Customer Base.

As of December 31,
2006, we had over 90,000 corporate clients in a variety of industries. We
currently provide services to commercial, legal, banking, healthcare,
accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including
more than 90% of the Fortune 1000 and 85% of the FTSE 100. No customer
accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2005 and 2006. For each of the three years 2004 through 2006, the average
volume reduction due to customers terminating their relationship with us was
less than 2%.

·

Capital Expenditures Related Primarily to Growth.

Our
information protection and storage business requires limited annual capital
expenditures made in order to maintain our current revenue stream. For the
years 2004 through 2006, over 85% of our aggregate capital expenditures were
growth-related investments, primarily in storage systems, which include
racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and
software, and buildings. These growth-related capital expenditures are
primarily discretionary and create additional capacity for increases in
revenues and OIBDA. In addition, since shifting our focus from growth through
acquisitions to internal revenue growth, our capital expenditures, made
primarily to support our internal revenue growth, have exceeded the aggregate
acquisition consideration we conveyed in both 2001 and 2002. Although this was
not the case in 2003 due to the acquisition of Hays IMS and in 2004 due to the
acquisition of Connected and the 49.9% equity interest held by Mentmore plc (“Mentmore”)
in Iron Mountain Europe Limited (“IME”), it was the case in both 2005 and 2006
and we expect this trend to continue in the future absent unusual acquisition
activity.

Growth Strategy

Our objective is to
maintain a leadership position in the information protection and storage
services industry around the world, protecting and storing our customers’
information without regard to media format or geographic location. In the U.S.
and Canada, we seek to be one of the largest information protection and storage
services providers in each of our markets. Internationally, our objectives are
to continue to capitalize on our expertise in the information protection and
storage services industry and to make additional acquisitions and investments
in selected international markets. Our primary avenues of growth are: (1) increased
business with existing customers; (2) the addition of new customers; (3) the
introduction of new products and services such as secure shredding and
electronic vaulting; and (4) selective acquisitions in new and existing
markets.

Growth from
Existing Customers

Our existing customers storing physical records
contribute to storage and storage-related service revenues growth because on
average they generate additional cartons at a faster rate than old cartons are
destroyed or permanently removed. In order to maximize growth opportunities
from existing customers, we seek to maintain high levels of customer retention
by providing premium customer service through our local account management
staff.

Our sales coverage model
is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by
allocating our sales resources based on a sophisticated segmentation of our
customer base and selling additional records management, data protection &
recovery and information destruction services, in new and existing markets,
within our existing customer relationships. We also seek to leverage existing
business relationships with our customers by selling complementary services and
products. Services include records tracking, indexing, customized reporting,
vital records management and consulting services.


Addition of New
Customers

Our sales forces are
dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer
account relationships; (2) generating additional revenue from existing
customers; and (3) expanding new and existing customer relationships by
effectively selling a wide array of complementary services and products. In
order to accomplish these objectives, our sales forces draw on our U.S. and
international marketing organizations and senior management.

Introduction of New
Products and Services

We continue to expand our
menu of products and services. We have established a national presence in the
secure shredding industry in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. and offer our
electronic vaulting management services worldwide. These new products and
services allow us to further penetrate our existing customer accounts and
attract new customers in previously untapped markets.

Growth through
Acquisitions

Our acquisition strategy
includes expanding geographically, as necessary, and increasing our presence
and scale within existing markets through “fold-in” acquisitions. We have a
successful record of acquiring and integrating information protection and
storage services companies. Between January 1, 1996, when we began our
acquisition program, and December 31, 2006, we completed 187 acquisitions
in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific for total
consideration of approximately $3.1 billion, including approximately
$1 billion associated with our merger with Pierce Leahy Corp. (“Pierce
Leahy”) in February 2000. During that period, we substantially completed
our geographic expansion in North America, Europe and Latin America and began
our expansion into Asia Pacific.

Acquisitions in the
U.S. and Canada

We intend to continue our
acquisition program in the U.S. and Canada focusing primarily on the secure
shredding industry, expanding geographically, as necessary and building scale
in some of our smaller markets through “fold-in” acquisitions. However, given
the small number of large acquisition prospects and our increased revenue base,
future acquisitions are expected to be less significant to overall U.S. and
Canadian revenue growth.

International
Acquisition Strategy

We also intend to continue to make acquisitions and
investments in information protection and storage services businesses outside
the U.S. and Canada. We have acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire and
invest in, information protection and storage services companies in countries,
and, more specifically, markets within such countries, where we believe there
is sufficient demand from existing multinational customers or the potential for
significant growth. Since beginning our international expansion program in January 1999,
we have directly and through joint ventures, expanded our operations into 26
countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. These transactions have
taken, and may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of the entire
business or controlling or minority investments, with a long-term goal of full
ownership. In addition to the criteria we use to evaluate U.S. and Canadian
acquisition candidates, we also evaluate the presence in the potential market
of our existing customers as well as the risks uniquely associated with an
international investment, including those risks described below.

The experience, depth and strength of local management
are particularly important in our international acquisition strategy. As a
result, we have formed joint ventures with, or acquired significant interests
in, target businesses throughout Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. We
began our international expansion by acquiring a 50.1% controlling interest in
each of our IME, Iron Mountain


South America, Ltd.
(“IMSA”) and Sistemas de Archivo Corporativo (a Mexican limited liability
company) subsidiaries.

In 2006, we established a majority-owned joint venture
serving four major markets in India, completed minority investments in information
protection and storage businesses with operations in Poland and Russia, and
signed a definitive agreement to establish a majority-owned joint venture in
Asia Pacific. The Asia Pacific transaction is expected to close in the first
quarter of 2007 for consideration of approximately $2 million and gives us an
initial presence in Singapore, Hong
Kong-SAR, China, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and Malaysia.

We believe this strategy, rather than an outright
acquisition, may, in certain markets, better position us to expand the existing
business. The local partner benefits from our expertise in the information
protection and storage services industry, our multinational customer
relationships, our access to capital and our technology, and we benefit from
our local partner’s knowledge of the market, relationships with local customers
and their presence in the community.

Our long-term goal is to acquire full ownership of
each such business. To that end, in February 2004, we acquired the
remaining 49.9% minority equity interest in IME, in January 2005, we
acquired the remaining 49.9% minority equity interest in IMSA and in April 2006,
we acquired the remaining minority equity ownership in our Mexican operations. In
addition, we have bought out partnership interests, in whole or in part, in
Chile, Eastern Europe and the Netherlands. As a result of these transactions we
own more than 98% of our international operations, measured as a percentage of
consolidated revenues.

Our international investments are subject to risks and
uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and
economic structures of other countries, as well as fluctuations in currency
valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting
returns to foreign investors.

The amount of our revenues
derived from international operations and other relevant financial data for
fiscal years 2004, 2005 and 2006 are set forth in Note 9 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. For the years ended December 31, 2004,
2005 and 2006, we derived approximately 27%, 28%

and
30%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside of the U.S. As of December 31,
2004, 2005 and 2006, we have long-lived assets of approximately 31%, 31% and
33%, respectively, from outside of the U.S.

Digital Growth and
Technology Innovation Strategy

Similar to our physical businesses, we seek to grow
revenues in our Worldwide Digital Segment by selling our products and services
to existing and new customers. Our focus on technology innovation allows us to
bring leading products and services to market designed to solve customer
problems in the areas of data protection and e-records management. Our approach
to innovation has three major components: build, buy and partner. We will build
or develop our own technology in areas core to our strategy in order to protect
and extend our lead in the market. Examples include, back up and archiving
Software as a Service and data reduction technologies. Our technology
acquisition strategy is designed to accelerate our product strategy, leadership
and time to market and past examples include the Connected and LiveVault
acquisitions. Finally, we are developing global technology partnerships that
complement our product and service offerings, allow us to offer a complete
solution to the marketplace and keep us in contact with emerging technology
companies.


Customers

Our customer base is
diversified in terms of revenues and industry concentration. As of December 31,
2006, we had over 90,000 corporate clients in a variety of industries. We
currently provide services to commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting,
insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 90%
of the Fortune 1000 and more than 85% of the FTSE 100. No customer accounted
for more than 2% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2005 and 2006.

Competition

We compete with our current and potential customers’
internal information protection and storage services capabilities. We can
provide no assurance that these organizations will begin or continue to use an
outside company such as Iron Mountain for their future information protection
and storage services.

We compete with multiple information protection and
storage services providers in all geographic areas where we operate. We believe
that competition for customers is based on price, reputation for reliability,
quality of service and scope and scale of technology and that we generally
compete effectively based on these factors.

We also compete with other
information protection and storage services providers for companies to acquire.
Some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources.
If any such competitor were to devote additional resources to the information
protection and storage services business and such acquisition candidates or
focus their strategy on our markets, our results of operations could be
adversely affected.

Alternative
Technologies

We derive most of our
revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage-related services. This
storage requires significant physical space. Alternative storage technologies
exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents.
These technologies include computer media, microform, CD-ROM and optical disk.
To date, none of these technologies has replaced paper documents as the
principal means for storing information. However, we can provide no assurance
that our customers will continue to store most of their records in paper
documents format. We continue to invest in additional services such as
electronic vaulting and e-records management, designed to address our customers’
need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality solutions for electronic
records and information management.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, we employed over 10,400
employees in the U.S. and over 8,200 employees outside of the U.S. At December 31,
2006, an aggregate of 600 employees were represented by unions in California,

Georgia and two cities in Canada.

All non-union employees
are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include
medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability, retirement/401(k) and
accidental death and dismemberment plans. Unionized employees receive these
types of benefits through their unions. In addition to base compensation and
other usual benefits, all full-time employees participate in some form of
incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues,
profits, collections or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in
which they work. Management believes that we have good relationships with our
employees and unions. However, as of December 31 2006, certain of our labor
contracts had expired, and we were operating under the expired contracts while attempting
to negotiate replacement agreements.


Insurance

For strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a
comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable
and that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be
appropriate. Property insurance is purchased on an all-risk basis, including
flood and earthquake, subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and
deductibles, and inclusive of the replacement cost of real and personal
property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra
expense. Separate excess policies for insurer defined Critical Earthquake Zone
exposures are maintained at what we believe to be appropriate limits and
deductibles for that exposure. Included among other types of insurance that we
carry, subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles, are:
workers compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional,
warehouse legal and directors and officers liability policies. In 2002, we
established a wholly-owned Vermont domiciled captive insurance company as a
subsidiary; through the subsidiary we retain and reinsure a portion of our
property loss exposure.

Our standard form of
storage contract in the U.S. sets forth an agreed maximum valuation for each
carton or other storage unit held by us, which serves as a limitation of liability
for loss or damage, as permitted under the Uniform Commercial Code. In
contracts containing such limits, such values are nominal, and we believe that
in typical circumstances our liability would be so limited in the event of loss
or damage to stored items for which we may be held liable. Outside the U.S.,
most of our contracts have similar limited valuation and liability provisions
that we believe are in accordance with local business customs and statutes.
However, some of our agreements with large volume accounts and some of the
contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher
limits or supplemental insurance arrangements.

Environmental
Matters

Some of our current and formerly owned or leased
properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or
other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of
hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. In some
instances these properties included the operation of underground storage tanks
or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. Although we have from time to
time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at
some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental
review of all of our properties. We therefore may be potentially liable for
environmental costs and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use
contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. Under various federal, state
and local environmental laws, we may be potentially liable for environmental
compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at
owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination,
whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the
contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. Environmental
conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we
may acquire in the future. In addition, future regulatory action and
environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not
exist today.

We transfer a portion of
our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by
purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers
all owned and leased locations. Coverage is provided for both liability and
remediation costs.

Reincorporation

On May 27, 2005, Iron
Mountain Incorporated, a Pennsylvania corporation (“Iron Mountain PA”),
reincorporated as a Delaware corporation. The reincorporation was effected by
means of a statutory merger (the “Merger”) of Iron Mountain PA with and into
Iron Mountain Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (“Iron Mountain DE”), a
wholly owned subsidiary of Iron Mountain PA. In connection with


the
Merger, Iron Mountain DE succeeded to and assumed all of the assets and
liabilities of Iron Mountain PA. Apart from the change in its state of
incorporation, the Merger had no effect on Iron Mountain PA’s business, board
composition, management, employees, fiscal year, assets or liabilities, or
location of its facilities, and did not result in any relocation of management
or other employees. The Merger was approved at the Annual Meeting of
Stockholders held on May 26, 2005. Upon consummation of the Merger, Iron
Mountain DE succeeded to Iron Mountain PA’s reporting obligations and continued
to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “IRM.”

Item 1A. Risk
Factors.

Our business faces many
risks. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks
actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations
could suffer and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could
decline. Our investors and prospective investors should consider the following
risks and the information contained under the heading “Cautionary Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” before deciding to invest in our
securities.

Operational Risks

We face competition
for customers.

We compete with our
current and potential customers’ internal information protection and storage
services capabilities. These organizations may not begin or continue to use an
outside company, such as our company, for their future information protection
and storage services needs or may not use us to provide these services. We also
compete with multiple information protection and storage services providers in
all geographic areas where we operate.

Governmental focus
on data security could increase our costs of operations. In addition, our
failure to protect our customers’ confidential information against security
breaches could damage our reputation, harm our business and adversely impact
our

results of
operations.

Many new state and federal laws and regulations are
being contemplated and enacted relative to privacy issues in general and the
care and handling of personal information in particular. In reaction to
publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost,
illegally accessed or stolen, many states have adopted breach of data security
statutes and regulations that require notification to consumers if the security
of their personal information, such as social security numbers, is breached. In
addition, the United States Congress is considering several bills that are
intended to address data security, including by requiring notification to
affected persons of breaches of data security. We have cooperated with a U.S.
federal agency in a non-public inquiry regarding our information security
practices, and we may


be subject to additional
inquiries in the future. We have experienced incidents in which customers’
backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed by
customers in some incidents that the lost media or records contained personal
information. The increased focus on data security may lead to governmental
action and/or changes in customer demand as a result of which we may modify our
operations with the goal of further improving data security or accept increased
liabilities or obligations if breaches of data security occur with respect to
data in our custody. However, we may be unable to increase our rates
sufficiently to counter our increased expenses due to such modifications in
operations or such acceptance of increased liabilities and obligations, and
that would adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, any
compromise of security, accidental loss or theft of customer data in our
possession could damage our reputation and expose us to risk of liability,
which could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations.

We may not be able
to effectively expand our digital businesses.

We are implementing
our planned expansion into various digital businesses. Our entrance into these
markets poses certain unique risks. For example, we may be unable to:

·

raise
the amount of capital necessary to effectively participate in these businesses;

·

develop,
hire or otherwise obtain the necessary technical expertise;

·

accurately
predict the size of the markets for any of these services; or

·

compete
effectively against other companies that possess greater technical expertise,
capital or other necessary resources.

In addition, the digital
solutions we offer may not gain or retain market acceptance, or business
partners upon whom we depend for technical and management expertise, as well as
the hardware and software products we need to complement our services, may not
perform as expected.

Our customers may
shift from paper storage to alternative technologies that require less physical
space.

We derive most of our
revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage related services. This
storage requires significant physical space. Alternative storage technologies
exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents.
These technologies include computer media, microform, CD-ROM and optical disk.
We can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of
their records in paper documents format. A significant shift by our customers
to storage of data through non-paper based technologies, whether now existing
or developed in the future, could adversely affect our business.

We may be subject
to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate
required for our businesses.

Because our
businesses are heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks
attributable to the real estate we own or lease. Such risks include:

·

variable
occupancy costs and difficulty locating suitable sites due to fluctuations in
the real estate market;

·

uninsured
losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full
coverage on a cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as earthquakes, or
any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist
activities;

·

loss
of our investment in, and anticipated profits and cash flow from, damaged
property that is uninsured; and


·

liability
under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of
contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not we know of, or
were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we
owned or leased the property.

Some of our current and
formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than
us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation
and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum
products. In some instances these properties included the operation of
underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials.
Although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental
investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current
facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of
our properties. We therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs
like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use
contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. Environmental conditions for
which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in
the future. In addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may
impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today.

International
operations may pose unique risks.

As of December 31,
2006, we provided services in 86 markets outside the U.S. As part of our growth
strategy, we expect to continue to acquire information protection and storage
services businesses in foreign markets. International operations are subject to
numerous risks, including:

·

the
impact of foreign government regulations;

·

the
volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate;

·

political
uncertainties;

·

the
risk that the business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or
management and acquisition expertise outside of the U.S. will not perform as
expected;

·

differences
in business practices; and

·

foreign
currency fluctuations.

In particular, our net
income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies associated
with certain intercompany balances among our U.S. entities and our foreign
subsidiaries and our U.K. entity and subsidiaries on the European continent.

Risks Relating to Our Common Stock

No Intention to Pay
Dividends

We have never declared or
paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We intend to retain future earnings
for use in our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash
dividends on shares of common stock in the foreseeable future. The terms of our
credit agreement and our indentures contain provisions permitting the payment
of cash dividends and stock repurchases subject to certain limitations.


Risks Relating to
Our Indebtedness

Our substantial
indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from
fulfilling our obligations under our various indebtedness.

We have a significant
amount of indebtedness. The following table shows important credit statistics
as of December 31, 2006:

At December 31, 2006

  debt

x

Our substantial indebtedness could have important
consequences to you. Our indebtedness may increase as we continue to borrow
under existing and future credit arrangements in order to finance future
acquisitions and for general corporate purposes, which would increase the
associated risks. These risks include:

·

inability
to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various indebtedness;

·

inability
to adjust to adverse economic conditions;

·

inability
to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other
general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases of our
various indebtedness;

·

limits
on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and
the information protection and storage services industry;

·

limits
on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which
could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity
needs;

·

inability
to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; and

·

restrictions on our ability
to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms.

Restrictive loan
covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy.

Our credit facility
and our indentures contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to,
among other things:

·

incur
additional indebtedness;

·

pay
dividends or make other restricted payments;

·

make
asset dispositions;

·

create
or permit liens; and

·

make
capital expenditures and other investments.

These restrictions may
adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth
strategies.

We may not have the
ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding
senior subordinated indebtedness upon a change of control event as required by
our indentures.

Upon the occurrence of a
change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding
senior subordinated indebtedness. However, it is possible that we will not have
sufficient funds at the time


of the
change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes or that
restrictions in our revolving credit facility will not allow such repurchases.
In addition, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged
recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not
constitute a ‘‘change of control’’ under our indentures.

Since Iron Mountain
is a holding company, our ability to make payments on our various indebtedness
depends in part on the operations of our subsidiaries.

Iron Mountain is a holding
company, and substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our
subsidiaries and substantially all of our operations are conducted by our
direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to make
payments on our various indebtedness will be dependent upon the receipt of
sufficient funds from our subsidiaries. However, our various indebtedness is
guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by most,
but not all, of our direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries.

Acquisition and
International Expansion Risks

Failure to
successfully integrate acquired operations could reduce our future results of
operations.

The success of any
acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company.
The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen
difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management’s
attention and our financial and other resources. We can give no assurance that
we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations
of any acquired business. Nor can we assure you that we will be able to
maintain or improve the historical financial performance of Iron Mountain or
our acquisitions. The failure to successfully integrate these cultures,
operating systems, procedures and information technologies could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We may be unable to
continue our international expansion.

Our growth strategy
involves expanding operations into international markets, and we expect to
continue this expansion. Europe and Latin America have been our primary areas
of focus for international expansion and we recently began our expansion into
the Asia Pacific region. We have entered into joint ventures and have acquired
all or a majority of the equity in information protection and storage services
businesses operating in these areas and are actively pursuing additional
opportunities. This growth strategy involves risks. We may be unable to pursue
this strategy in the future. For example, we may be unable to:

·

identify
suitable companies to acquire;

·

complete
acquisitions on satisfactory terms;

·

incur
additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay
the purchase price out of working capital, common stock or other equity
securities; or

·

enter
into successful business arrangements for technical assistance or management
and acquisition expertise outside of the U.S.

We also compete with other
information protection and storage services providers for companies to acquire.
Some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources.
If any such competitor were to devote additional resources to such acquisition
candidates or focus its strategy on our international markets, our results of
operations could be adversely affected.

Item
1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.


Item 2. Properties.

As of December 31,
2006, we conducted operations through 739 leased facilities and 214 facilities
that we own. Our facilities are divided among our reportable segments as
follows: North American Physical Business (644), International Physical
Business (301) and Worldwide Digital Business (8). These facilities contain a
total of 59.2 million square feet of space. Facility rent expense was
$153.1 million and $169.9 million for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2006, respectively. The leased facilities typically have initial lease
terms of ten to fifteen years with one or more five year options to extend. In
addition, some of the leases contain either a purchase option or a right of
first refusal upon the sale of the property. Our facilities are located
throughout North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, with the
largest number of facilities in California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey,
Texas, Canada and the U.K. We believe that the space available in our
facilities is adequate to meet our current needs, although future growth may
require that we acquire additional real property either by leasing or
purchasing. See Note 10 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
information regarding our minimum annual rental commitments.

Item 3. Legal
Proceedings.

We are involved in
litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business with a portion
of the defense and/or settlement costs being covered by various commercial
liability insurance policies purchased by us. In the opinion of management, no
material legal proceedings are pending to which we, or any of our properties,
are subject.

Item
4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There were no matters
submitted to a vote of security holders of Iron Mountain during the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006.


PART II

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related
Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange,
or NYSE, under the symbol “IRM.” On December 7, 2006, our board authorized
and approved a three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a dividend on
our common stock. We issued the additional shares of common stock resulting
from this stock dividend on December 29, 2006 to all stockholders of
record as of the close of business on December 18, 2006.

The
following table sets forth the high and low sale prices on the NYSE, for the
years 2005 and 2006, giving effect to such stock split:

The closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on February 15,
2007 was $28.51. As of February 15, 2007, there were 526 holders of record
of our common stock. We believe that there are more than 77,000 beneficial
owners of our common stock.

The only dividends we have paid on our common stock
during the last two years was the stock dividend paid in connection with the
stock split referenced above. Our Board currently intends to retain future
earnings, if any, for the development of our business and does not anticipate
paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any
determinations by our Board to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the
future will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of
operations and business requirements. Our Credit Facility permits the payment
of cash dividends and stock repurchases subject to certain limitations.

There was no common stock
repurchased or sales of unregistered securities for the fourth quarter ended December 31,
2006.

We recorded specific
charges associated with the integration of the operations of Pierce Leahy in
2002 within merger related expenses as a result of the Pierce Leahy acquisition
in 2000.

(2)

Effective January 1,
2003, we began using the fair value method of accounting in our financial
statements using the prospective method in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure.” As a result, we
recorded $1,664, $3,857, $6,189 and $12,387 for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively, associated with such stock
compensation expenses. We adopted SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based
Payment.” effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method,
as permitted under SFAS No. 123R. We record stock-based compensation
expense for the cost of stock options, restricted stock and shares issued under
the employee stock purchase plan based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R
beginning January 1, 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the
incremental stock-based compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R
caused income before provision for income taxes and minority interest to
decrease by $894, and net income to decrease by $539, and had no impact on
basic and diluted earnings per share.

OIBDA is defined as
operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses. OIBDA Margin is
calculated by dividing OIBDA by total revenues. For a more detailed definition
and


reconciliation of OIBDA
and a discussion of why we believe these measures provide relevant and useful
information to our current and potential investors, see Item 7. “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP
Measures.”

(4)

In connection with the
sale of Arcus Staffing Resources, Inc., which was accounted for as a
discontinued operation, we recorded income from discontinued operations of
$1,116 (net of tax of $768) in 2002 related to the reversal of remaining
liabilities associated with certain contingencies which have been resolved.

(5)

Effective January 1,
2002, we reviewed goodwill for impairment consistent with the guidelines of
SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and other Intangible Assets,” using a discounted
future cash flow approach to approximate fair value. The result of testing our goodwill
for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, as of January 1,
2002, was a non-cash charge of $6,396 (net of minority interest of $8,487)
related to the impairment of goodwill associated with our investment in South
America due primarily to the deterioration of the economy and the devaluation
of the currency in Argentina.

(6)

Effective
December 31, 2005, we adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.”
As a result, a non-cash charge of $2,751 net of tax benefit was recorded in the
fourth quarter of 2005 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See Note 2(f) to
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 7.

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following
discussion should be read in conjunction with “Item 6. Selected Financial Data”
and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other
financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing.

This discussion contains
“forward-looking statements,” as that term is defined in the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other federal securities laws. See
“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page ii of this
filing and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” beginning on page 14 of this filing.

Overview

Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service
and storage material sales revenues. Storage revenues, both physical and
digital, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information
protection and storage services industry, consist of largely recurring periodic
charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit or
per cubic foot of records basis), which are typically retained by customers for
many years, and have accounted for over 56% of total consolidated revenues in
each of the last five years. Our quarterly revenues from these fixed periodic
storage fees have grown for 72 consecutive quarters. Service and storage
material sales revenues are comprised of charges for related service activities
and courier operations and the sale of software licenses and storage materials.
Included in service and storage materials sales are related core service
revenues arising from: (1) the handling of records including the addition
of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed
records, destruction of records, and permanent withdrawals from storage;
(2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of
records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive
documents; and (4) other recurring services including maintenance and
support contracts. Our complementary services revenues arise from special
project work, including data restoration, providing fulfillment services,
consulting services and product sales, including software licenses, specially
designed storage containers, magnetic media (including computer tapes) and
related supplies. Our consolidated revenues are subject to variations caused by
the net effect of foreign currency


translation on revenue
derived from outside the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005
and 2006, we derived approximately 27%, 28% and 30%, respectively, of our total
revenues from outside the U.S.

We recognize revenue when the following criteria are
met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered,
the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the resulting
receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized
in the month the respective storage or service is provided and customers are
generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms. Amounts
related to future storage or prepaid service contracts, including maintenance
and support contracts, for customers where storage fees or services are billed
in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over
the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed.
Storage material sales are recognized when shipped to the customer and include
software license sales (less than 1% of consolidated revenues in 2006). Sales
of software licenses to distributors are recognized at the time a distributor
reports that the software has been licensed to an end-user and all
revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.

Cost of sales (excluding depreciation) consists
primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs
(including rent and utilities), transportation expenses (including vehicle
leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and
supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the
most significant. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a
percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount
and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets,
workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical
insurance and workers compensation. Trends in facility occupancy costs are
similarly impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of
properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases,
fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization
of these properties.

The expansion of our European, secure shredding and
digital services businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components.
Our European and secure shredding operations are more labor intensive than our
core physical businesses and therefore increase our labor costs as a percent of
consolidated revenues. This trend is partially offset by our digital services
businesses, which require significantly less direct labor. Our secure shredding
operations incur less facility costs and higher transportation costs as a
percent of revenues compared to our core physical businesses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist
primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information
technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as
expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional
fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wages
and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are
influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of
incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs
associated with medical insurance. The overhead structure of our expanding
European operations, as compared to our North American operations, is more
labor intensive and has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage, which
may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a
percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European operations become a more
meaningful percentage of our consolidated results. Similarly, our digital services
business requires a higher level of overhead, particularly in the area of
information technology, than our core physical businesses.


Our adoption of the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123
as amended by SFAS No. 148 has resulted in increasing amounts of selling,
general and administrative expenses. We began using the fair value method of
accounting for stock-based compensation in our financial statements beginning January 1,
2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing
expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of
adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. We
adopted SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” effective January 1,
2006 using the modified prospective method, as permitted under SFAS No. 123R.
We record stock-based compensation expense for the cost of stock options,
restricted stock and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan based
on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R beginning January 1, 2006. We
recorded approximately $0.9 million of additional stock compensation expense in
2006 associated with unvested stock option grants issued prior to January 1,
2003 associated with adopting SFAS No. 123R.

Our depreciation and amortization charges result
primarily from the capital-intensive nature of our business. The principal
components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking,
building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software,
and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationships and
acquisition costs and core technology and is impacted by the nature and timing
of acquisitions.

Our consolidated revenues
and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign
currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside
the U.S. During 2006, we have seen increases in both revenues and expenses as a
result of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, and
decreases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the weakening of the
British pound sterling and the Euro, based on an analysis of weighted average
rates for the comparable periods. It is difficult to predict how much foreign
currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future and how those fluctuations
will impact individual balances reported in our consolidated statement of
operations. Given the relative increase in our international operations, these
fluctuations may become material on individual balances. However, because both
the revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency of the country
in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations on
our operating income, operating margin and net income is mitigated.

Non-GAAP Measures

Operating Income
Before Depreciation and Amortization, or OIBDA

OIBDA is defined as
operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses. OIBDA Margin is
calculated by dividing OIBDA by total revenues. We use these measures to
evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated business. As such, we
believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current
and potential investors. We use OIBDA for planning purposes and multiples of
current or projected OIBDA-based calculations in conjunction with our
discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and
to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe OIBDA and OIBDA Margin are useful
measures to evaluate our ability to grow our revenues faster than our operating
expenses and they are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use
to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. OIBDA does
not include certain items, specifically (1) minority interest in earnings
(losses) of subsidiaries, net; (2) other (income) expense, net; (3) income
from discontinued operations and loss on sale of discontinued operations; and (4) cumulative
effect of change in accounting principle that we believe are not indicative of
our core operating results. OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net
and the provision for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our
capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the
operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, OIBDA does not include
depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of
capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to
incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. OIBDA and
OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for,
other measures of financial


performance
reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
Unites States of America, or GAAP, such as operating or net income or cash
flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP).

Critical Accounting
Policies

Our discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon
our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
for the period then ended. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the estimates
used, including those related to accounting for acquisitions, allowance for
doubtful accounts and credit memos, impairment of tangible and intangible
assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation and self-insured liabilities. We
base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current
conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical
accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular
order:

Accounting for
Acquisitions

Part of our growth strategy has included the
acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions
has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market
research, strategic planning, and the forecasting of expected future results
and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to
revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources.

Each acquisition has been accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting
standards at the date of each acquisition, including, Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 16, “Accounting for Business Combinations,” and SFAS No. 141,
“Business Combinations.” Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the
capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired
in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the
assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these
estimates are subject to adjustment. These estimates are subject to final
assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible
assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these
assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. We are not aware of any
information that would indicate that the final


purchase price allocations
for acquisitions completed in 2006 would differ meaningfully from preliminary
estimates. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In connection with each of
our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired
businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings. Our
restructuring activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities,
reductions in staffing levels, and other costs associated with exiting certain
activities of the businesses we acquire. The estimated cost of these
restructuring activities are included as costs of the acquisition and are
recorded as goodwill consistent with the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) Issue No. 95-3, “Recognition of Liabilities in Connection
with a Purchase Business Combination.” While we finalize our plans to
restructure the businesses we acquire within one year of the date of
acquisition, it may take more than one year to complete all activities related
to the restructuring of an acquired business.

Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memos

We maintain an allowance
for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the
potential inability of our customers to make required payments and disputes
regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we
consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged
receivables and credit memo activity, current economic conditions, and specific
circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of
our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant
improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of
the allowance may be required. As of December 31, 2005 and 2006, our
allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos balance totaled
$14.5 million and $15.2 million, respectively.

Impairment of
Tangible and Intangible Assets

Assets subject to
amortization:

In accordance
with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets,” we review long-lived assets and all amortizable intangible
assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these
assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of
the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The
operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic
region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover
the carrying amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down
first, followed by the other long-lived assets of the operation, to fair value.
Fair value is based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending
upon the nature of the assets.

Goodwill—Assets not subject to amortization:

We apply the provisions of SFAS No. 142 to
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives which are not amortized
but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators
arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives
are amortized over their useful lives. We have selected October 1 as our
annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill
impairment review as of October 1, 2004, 2005 and 2006 and noted no
impairment of goodwill. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of
factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections,
anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There
are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in
applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31,
2006, no factors were identified that would alter this assessment. When changes
occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, the goodwill is
reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values.
Our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment
analysis as of October 31, 2006 were as follows: North America excluding
Fulfillment; Fulfillment; U.K.; Continental Europe; Worldwide Digital Business
excluding Iron Mountain Intellectual Property Management, Inc. (“IPM”);
IPM; South America; Mexico and Asia Pacific. Goodwill valuations have been
calculated using an income


approach
based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This
approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount
factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in
economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in a
goodwill impairment in future periods.

Accounting for
Internal Use Software

We develop various software applications for internal
use. We account for those costs in accordance with the provisions of Statement
of Position (“SOP”) 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.” SOP 98-1 requires computer
software costs associated with internal use software to be expensed as incurred
until certain capitalization criteria are met. SOP 98-1 also defines
which types of costs should be capitalized and which should be expensed.
Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and
who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects,
to the extent time is spent directly on the project, are capitalized and
depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization
begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is
probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function
intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer
software costs that are capitalized are evaluated for impairment in accordance with
SFAS No.144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”

It may be necessary for us to write-off amounts
associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot
be completed as intended. Our expansion into new technology-based service
offerings requires the development of internal use software that will be
susceptible to rapid and significant changes in technology. We may be required
to write-off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal
use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of
the software’s estimated useful life. General uncertainties related to
expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and
market acceptance of our services, may adversely impact the recoverability of
these assets. See Note 2(f) to Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

During the year ended December 31,
2006, we wrote-off $6.3 million of previously deferred costs, primarily
internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development
projects that were discontinued, and such costs are included as a component of
selling, general and administrative expenses. During the year ended December 31,
2005, we replaced internal use software programs, which resulted in the
write-off to loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net
of the remaining net book value of $1.1 million. We did not have any such
write-offs during 2004.

Income Taxes

We have recorded a valuation allowance, amounting to
$27.3 million as of December 31, 2006, to reduce our deferred tax assets
to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In the ordinary
course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the
ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. If actual results differ unfavorably from
certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our
net deferred income tax assets and additional valuation allowances may be
required. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be
given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will
equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our
income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such
determination is made.

We are subject to examination by various tax
authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations.
We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities
and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2006, we
had approximately $62 million of reserves related to uncertain tax positions.
Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final


determination of tax
audits and any related litigation could result in favorable or unfavorable
changes in our estimates.

We have not provided
deferred taxes on book basis differences related to certain foreign
subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the
foreseeable future and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S.
These basis differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings
of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis differences could be reversed through a
sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries as well as
certain other events or actions on our part, which would result in an increase
in our provision for income taxes.

Stock-Based
Compensation

As of January 1, 2003, we adopted the measurement
provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148. As a result
we began using the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation
in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the
prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the
fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and
thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. We have applied the
fair value recognition provisions to all stock based awards granted, modified
or settled on or after January 1, 2003 and provided the required pro forma
information for all awards previously granted, modified or settled before January 1,
2003 in our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS
No. 123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”.
We adopted SFAS No. 123R effective January 1, 2006 using the
modified prospective method, as permitted under SFAS No. 123R. We record
stock-based compensation expense for the cost of stock options, restricted
stock and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan based on the
requirements of SFAS No. 123R beginning January 1, 2006.
Stock-based compensation expense, included in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations, for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $12.4 million
($9.2 million after tax or $0.05 per basic and diluted share). For the year
ended December 31, 2006, the incremental stock-based compensation expense
due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R caused income before provision for
income taxes and minority interest to decrease by $0.9 million, and net income
to decrease by $0.5 million, and had no impact on basic and diluted earnings
per share.

SFAS No. 123R also requires that the benefits
associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be
reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow, reducing
net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in future
periods.

The fair values of option,
employee stock purchase and restricted stock grants are estimated on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility and
the expected term are the input factors to that model which require the most
significant management judgment. Expected volatility is calculated utilizing
daily historical volatility over a period that equates to the expected life of
the option. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) is
estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees.

Self-Insured
Liabilities

We are self-insured up to certain limits for costs
associated with workers’ compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and
general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and
long-term disability programs. At December 31, 2005 and 2006 there were
approximately $30.4 million and $28.2 million, respectively, of self-insurance
accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The measurement of these
costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments
about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these
costs primarily through actuarial


methods, which develop
estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those
claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future
ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date.

We believe the use of
actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and
effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of
any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the
magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is
known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are appropriate.
Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity, and
other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”), an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SFAS No. 109”).
FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a
company’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109

.

FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.

The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with
FIN 48 is a two-step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby
the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals
or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The
second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more
likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of
benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured
at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being
realized upon ultimate settlement.

The provisions of FIN 48 are effective January 1,
2007. The provisions of FIN 48 are to be applied to all tax positions upon
initial adoption of this standard. Only tax positions that meet the more likely
than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or
continue to be recognized upon adoption of FIN 48. The cumulative effect of
applying the provisions of FIN 48 should be reported as an adjustment to the
opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year. We are in the
process of evaluating the effect of FIN 48 on our consolidated results of
operations and financial position.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
“Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157 defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under
other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements,
and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal
years. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a
material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (“SAB 108”), “Considering the Effects of Prior
Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements,” which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the
carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in
quantifying a current year misstatement. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal
years ending after November 15, 2006. We have completed our analysis
related to the implementation of SAB 108 and have concluded it has no effect on
our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities-Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“SFAS
No. 159”). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many
financial instruments and certain other items at fair


value.
SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of SFAS No. 159 on
our consolidated results of operations and financial position.

Revenue

Our consolidated storage revenues increased $145.6
million, or 12.3%, to $1,327.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2006 and $138.2 million, or 13.2%, to $1,181.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2005, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The increase is attributable to internal revenue growth (10%
during 2006 and 9% during 2005) resulting from net increases in records and
other media stored by existing customers, sales to new customers and the net
result of pricing actions, acquisitions (2% during 2006 and 3% during 2005),
and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (0% during 2006 and 1% during
2005).

Consolidated service and storage material sales
revenues increased $126.6 million, or 14.1%, to $1,023.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2006 and $122.4 million, or 15.8%, to $896.6 million
for the year ended December 31, 2005, in comparison to the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase is attributable to acquisitions (7%
during 2006 and 7% during 2005), internal revenue growth (7% during 2006 and 7%
during 2005) resulting from net increases in service and storage material sales
to existing customers and sales to new customers, and foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations (0% during 2006 and 1% during 2005).


For the reasons stated
above, our consolidated revenues increased $272.2 million, or 13.1%, to
$2,350.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $260.6 million,
or 14.3%, to $2,078.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, in
comparison to the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2005, foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations that impacted our revenues were primarily due to the strengthening
of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S.
dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable
periods. For the year ended December 31, 2006, foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were primarily due to the
weakening of the British pound sterling and Euro, net of the strengthening of
the Canadian dollar, against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted
average rates for the comparable periods. Internal revenue growth was 8%, 8% and
9% for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. We
calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international
operations.

Our internal revenue growth rate represents the
weighted average year over year growth rate of our revenues after removing the
effects of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the
impact of the fire in our London, England facility. Over the past eight
quarters, the internal growth rate of our storage revenues has increased from a
range of 8% to 9% to a range of 10% to 11%. In our North American Physical
Business, net carton volume growth remained stable and we benefited from an
increasingly positive pricing environment in 2005 and 2006. Strong growth rates
in our digital services business more than offset the impact of reduced growth
rates in Europe in 2005 resulting from the inclusion of the slower growing Hays
IMS business in our base revenues for internal growth calculation purposes. In
2006, our European business posted improved storage internal revenue growth
rates. Net carton volume growth is a function of the rate new cartons are added
by existing and new customers offset by the rate of carton destructions and
other permanent removals.

The internal growth rate for service and storage
material sales revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage revenue
internal growth rate due to the more discretionary nature of the services we
offer such as large special projects or data products and carton sales, as well
as the price of recycled paper. These revenues are often event driven and
impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel
the purchase of these services as a way to reduce their short-term costs. As a
commodity, recycled paper prices are subject to the volatility of that market.

The internal growth rate for service and storage material
sales revenues reflects the following: (1) stronger data product sales in
2005; (2) a large data restoration project completed by our digital
services business in the third quarter of 2005; (3) improved growth rates
in our data protection and fulfillment businesses; (4) continued growth in
our secure shredding operations; and (5) growth in North American storage
related service revenues. These positive factors were partially offset
by lower special project revenues related to the public sector business in
the U.K. in 2005.

Labor

For the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared
to the year ended December 31, 2005, labor expense as a percentage of
consolidated revenue increased as a result of higher labor costs resulting from
our Australia/New Zealand acquisition and our recent shredding acquisitions in
Europe, which have a higher service revenue component and are therefore more
labor intensive. Our digital business had higher costs of labor associated with
internal information technology personnel and consultants dedicated to revenue
producing projects.

For the year ended December 31,
2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, labor expense as a
percentage of consolidated revenue decreased as a result of strong revenue
growth, an increasing proportion of revenue from less labor intensive digital
services and product sales. We also experienced improvement in our ratio of
labor costs to revenues in our European operations as a result of completing
the integration of Hays IMS in 2004.

Facilities

Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated
revenues increased to 13.7% for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in facilities
costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues was primarily a result of
increases in utilities and maintenance costs, as well as, increased insurance
deductibles and security costs associated with protecting our assets, as a
response to the fires in Ottawa, Canada and London, England. Rent expense
decreased slightly as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31,
2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a
decrease in overall base rent per square foot in our North American operations
when comparing 2005 to 2006. The largest component of our facilities cost is
rent expense, which increased in dollar terms by $17.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005.
Given current property insurance market conditions, especially in relation


to catastrophe exposures
of earthquake, flood and wind, we expect our insurance costs associated with
our real estate portfolio to rise in 2007 when compared to 2006.

Facilities costs as a
percentage of consolidated revenues decreased to 13.3% for the year ended December 31,
2005 from 13.6% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in
facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues was primarily a
result of maintaining approximately the same overall base rent per square foot
in our North American operations during 2004 and 2005 while consolidated
revenues increased. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent
expense, which increased $15.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of
properties under lease acquired through acquisitions in both Europe and North
America. The expansion of our secure shredding business, which incurs lower
facilities costs than our core physical businesses, also helped lower our
facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues.

Transportation

Our transportation expenses, which remained consistent
as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31,
2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, are influenced by
several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased
vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses and maintenance. Higher
fuel costs, increased maintenance expenses resulting from the accelerated
implementation of a fleet-wide maintenance program in North America and vehicle
leasing expenses were primarily responsible for the dollar increase in
transportation expenses.

Our transportation
expenses, which increased 0.2% as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31,
2004, are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles,
owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses and
maintenance. Higher fuel expenses during the year ended December 31, 2005
compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 were primarily responsible
for the increase in transportation expenses as a percentage of consolidated
revenues.

Product and Other
Cost of Sales

Product and other cost of
sales are highly correlated to complementary revenue streams. Product cost of
sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased due to a
corresponding reduction in product sales in the comparable periods. Product and
other cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 were higher than
the year ended December 31, 2004 as a percentage of consolidated revenues
due to increased sales of data products at lower margins in North America,
increased royalty payments associated with our electronic vaulting revenues and
increases in technology costs associated with these revenue producing
activities.

General and
Administrative

The increase in general and administrative expenses as
a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006
compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 is mainly attributable to (a) increased
compensation expense due to expansion through acquisitions, (b) costs
associated with our North American reorganization which added a new level of
field management, and (c) costs associated with a North American field
operations meeting held in 2006 that was not held in 2005.

The decrease in general
and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31,
2004 is attributable to strong revenue growth and controls over overhead
spending implemented in late 2004. These decreases were partially offset by
increased incentive compensation expense and growth of our North American and
European operations due to expansion and acquisitions.

Sales, Marketing &
Account Management

The majority of our sales, marketing and account
management costs are labor related and are primarily driven by the headcount in
each of these departments. Increased headcount and related compensation and
commissions are the most significant contributors to the increase in sales,
marketing expenses and account management for the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005. Throughout the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and into
2006, we invested in the expansion and improvement of our sales, marketing and
account management functions.

During 2006 in North America, while our sales force
headcount increased at a slower rate than revenue growth, the shift to higher
end resources drove an increase in the level of spending due to higher costs
per sales person and the additional support required. We have significantly
increased the size of our digital sales force through our acquisition of
LiveVault and the hiring of new sales employees, particularly in Europe.
Additionally, costs associated with an enterprise-wide sales meeting held in
2006 and not held in 2005 also contributed to this increase. Our larger North
American sales force generated a $6.3 million increase in sales commissions and
an increase of $13.6 million of compensation expense for the year ended December 31,
2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005.

Our North American sales
force generated a $3.0 million increase in sales commissions and an increase of
$14.8 million of compensation expense for the year ended December 31,
2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Marketing expenses for
the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $3.3 million due to the
introduction of several new marketing and promotional efforts to continue to
develop awareness in the marketplace of our entire portfolio of services,
especially our digital services.

Information
Technology

Information technology expenses increased as a
percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006
compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 due to increases in technology


development activities
within our digital services business, including the acquisition of LiveVault
and associated research and development activities and increased spending to
support our growing digital archiving business. Additionally, during 2006, we
wrote-off $5.9 million of previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor
costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were
discontinued. Higher utilization of existing information technology resources
to revenue producing projects, which are charged to costs of goods sold and
decreased information technology spending in our European operations, partially
offset this increase.

Information technology
expenses increased as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31,
2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 due to increases in
internal software development projects within our digital services business,
the acquisitions of Connected and LiveVault and associated research and
development activities, and increased information technology spending in our
European operations. Higher utilization of existing information technology
resources to revenue producing projects, which are charged to cost of goods
sold, partially offset this increase.

Bad Debt Expense

Consolidated bad debt
expense for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 reflects what we
believe to be more normal levels of bad debt expense compared to 2004. The
decrease in consolidated bad debt expense for the year ended December 31,
2004 is primarily attributable to the success of our centralized collection
efforts within the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in improved cash collections
and an improved accounts receivable aging that allowed us to reduce our
allowance for doubtful accounts.

Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) and Loss on
Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense
increased $21.5 million to $208.4 million (8.9% of consolidated revenues) for
the year ended December 31, 2006 from $187.0 million (9.0% of consolidated
revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005. Consolidated depreciation
and amortization expense increased $23.3 million to $187.0 million (9.0% of
consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $163.6
million (9.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31,
2004. Depreciation expense increased $17.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 and increased $18.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31,
2004, primarily due to the additional depreciation expense related to recent
capital expenditures and acquisitions, including storage systems, which include
racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and
software, and buildings.

Amortization expense increased $4.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31,
2005 and increased $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to
amortization of intangible assets, such as customer relationship intangible
assets and intellectual property acquired through business combinations. We
expect that amortization expense will continue to increase as we acquire new
businesses and reflect the full year impact of our 2006 acquisitions.

Consolidated gains on
disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $9.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 2006, consisted primarily of a gain on the
sale of a property in the U.K. of $10.5 million offset by disposals and
writedowns. Consolidated gains on disposal/writedown of property, plant and
equipment, net of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005,
consisted primarily of a gain on the sale of a property in the U.K. of $4.5
million offset primarily by software asset writedowns of $1.1 million.
Consolidated gains on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net
of


$0.7 million
for the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted primarily of a $1.2 million
gain on the sale of a property in Florida during the second quarter of 2004
offset by disposals and asset writedowns.

Operating Income

As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated
operating income increased $20.4 million, or 5.3%, to $407.2 million (17.3% of
consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $386.8
million (18.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31,
2005.

Consolidated operating
income increased $42.3 million, or 12.3%, to $386.8 million (18.6% of
consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $344.5
million (19.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31,
2004.

OIBDA

As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated
OIBDA increased $41.9 million, or 7.3%, to $615.6 million (26.2% of
consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $573.7 million
(27.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Consolidated OIBDA
increased $65.6 million, or 12.9%, to $573.7 million (27.6% of consolidated
revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $508.1 million (28.0%
of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Interest Expense,
Net

Consolidated interest expense, net increased $11.4 million
to $195.0 million (8.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31,
2006 from $183.6 million (8.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31,
2005. The change is primarily due to increased borrowings to fund our 2005 and
2006 acquisitions, particularly LiveVault and Pickfords Records Management
(“Pickfords”).

Consolidated interest
expense, net decreased $2.2 million to $183.6 million (8.8% of
consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $185.7
million (10.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31,
2004. The dollar decrease in interest expense, net was primarily due to the
recording of interest expense totaling $21.5 million for the year ending December 31,
2004 compared to interest expense totaling $2.3 million for the year ending December 31,
2005 related to the net impact of mark-to-market adjustments and cash payments
on all of our interest rate swap contracts. This was offset by increased
borrowings, primarily an additional $150.0 million of term loans borrowed in November 2004
as permitted under our IMI Credit Agreement and the full year effect of the March 2004
IME Credit Agreement.

Foreign currency gains of $12.5 million based on
period-end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31,
2006 primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling and
Canadian dollar, and the weakening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar as these
currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our Canadian,
U.K., and European subsidiaries, borrowings denominated in certain foreign
currencies under our revolving credit facility and British pounds sterling
denominated debt held by our U.S. parent company.

Foreign currency losses of $7.2 million based on
period-end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31,
2005 primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling, and Euro,
net of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar as
these currencies relate to our inter-company balances with and between our
Canadian, U.K. and European subsidiaries, borrowings denominated in foreign
currencies under our revolving credit facility and British pounds sterling
denominated debt held by our U.S. parent company.

Foreign currency gains $8.9 million based on
period-end exchange rates were recorded during the year ended December 31,
2004, primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Euro,
and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar as these currencies relate to
our inter-company balances with and between our Canadian, U.K., and European
subsidiaries, U.S. dollar denominated debt held by our Canadian subsidiary,
borrowings denominated in foreign currencies under our revolving credit
facility, British pounds sterling denominated debt held by our U.S. parent
company, British pounds sterling currency held in the U.S. and our British
pound sterling denominated cross currency swap, which was terminated in March 2004.

During 2006, we redeemed
or purchased a portion of our outstanding 8


¤


% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 and


¤


% Senior Subordinated Notes
due 2013 resulting in a charge of $2.8 million, which consists of tender
premiums and transaction costs, deferred financing costs, as well as original
issue discounts and premiums. During 2004, we redeemed the remaining
outstanding principal amount of the 8


¤


% Senior Notes due 2008 of our Canadian
subsidiary, resulting in a charge of $2.0 million, and we repaid a portion of
our real estate term loans, which resulted in a charge of $0.4 million. The
charges consisted primarily of the call and tender premiums associated with the
extinguished debt and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing cost and
discounts.

Provision for
Income Taxes

Our effective tax rates
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005, and 2006 were 41.7%, 41.4% and
41.8%, respectively. The primary reconciling items between the statutory rate
of 35% and our effective rate are state income taxes (net of federal benefit)
and differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject.
During  2006, we recorded a reduction in
income tax expense as a result of a new Texas law changing the way state income
tax is calculated in that state. As a result of this change, we have
reversed a deferred tax liability of $1.7 million, net of federal tax benefit,
related to our Texas state taxes. We are subject to income taxes in both the
U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by
various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business
operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax
authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. Although we believe
our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and
any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates.


Minority Interest

Minority interest in
earnings of subsidiaries, net resulted in a charge to income of $3.0 million
(0.2% of consolidated revenues), $1.7 million (0.1% of consolidated revenues)
and  $1.6 million (0.1% of consolidated
revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005, and 2006,
respectively. This represents our minority partners’ share of earnings in our
majority-owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our
operating results. The decrease during 2005 is the result of our acquisition of
various Latin American minority partner interests.

Cumulative Effect
of Change in Accounting Principle

In March 2005, the
FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations” (“FIN 47”), an interpretation of SFAS No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (“SFAS No. 143”). FIN 47
clarifies that conditional asset retirement obligations meet the definition of
liabilities and should be recognized when incurred if their fair values can be reasonably
estimated. Uncertainty surrounding the timing and method of settlement that may
be conditional on events occurring in the future are factored into the
measurement of the liability rather than the existence of the liability. SFAS
No. 143 established accounting and reporting standards for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets legally required
by law, regulatory rule or contractual agreement and the associated asset
retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value
of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is
incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the
cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset, which
is then depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The liability is
increased over time through income as a component of depreciation expense, such
that the liability will equate to the future cost to retire the long-lived
asset at the expected retirement date.  Upon settlement of the liability,
an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a
gain or loss upon settlement. Our obligations are primarily the result of
requirements under our facility lease agreements which generally have “return
to original condition” clauses which would require us to remove or restore
items such as shred pits, vaults, demising walls and office build-outs, among
others. As of December 31, 2005, we have recognized the cumulative effect
of initially applying FIN 47 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle as prescribed in FIN 47, which resulted in a gross charge of $4.4
million ($2.8 million, net of tax).

Net Income

As a result of all the foregoing factors, for the year
ended December 31, 2006, consolidated net income increased $17.8 million,
or 16.0%, to $128.9 million (5.5% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $111.1
million (5.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31,
2005.

As a result of all the
foregoing factors, for the year ended December 31, 2005, consolidated net
income increased $16.9 million, or 18.0%, to $111.1 million (5.3% of
consolidated revenues) from net income of $94.2 million (5.2% of consolidated
revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Segment Analysis
(in thousands)

The results of our various
operating segments are discussed below. Beginning January 1, 2006, we
changed our reportable segments as a result of certain management and
organizational changes within our North American business. Therefore, the
presentation of all historical segment reporting has been changed to conform to
our new management reporting. Our reportable segments are now North American
Physical Business, International Physical Business and Worldwide Digital
Business. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our North
American Physical Business, which consists of the United States and Canada,
offers the storage of paper documents, as well as all other non-electronic
media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film,
X-rays and blueprints, including healthcare


information
services, vital records services, service and courier operations, and the
collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents for corporate
customers (“Hard Copy”); the storage and rotation of backup computer media as
part of corporate disaster recovery plans, including service and courier
operations (“Data Protection”); secure shredding services (“Shredding”); and
the storage, assembly, and detailed reporting of customer marketing literature
and delivery to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers’ sites
based on current and prospective customer orders, which we refer to as the “Fulfillment”
business. Our International Physical Business segment offers information
protection and storage services throughout Europe, South America, Mexico and
Asia Pacific, including Hard Copy, Data Protection and Shredding. Our Worldwide
Digital Business offers information protection and storage services for
electronic records conveyed via telecommunication lines and the Internet,
including online backup and recovery solutions for server data and personal

basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Contribution to
income before provision for income taxes and minority interest on a
consolidated basis.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, revenue
in our North American Physical Business segment increased 9.2% primarily due to
increasing storage internal growth rates resulting from stable net volume
growth and an increasingly positive pricing environment, increasing service
revenue growth rates particularly in data protection and fulfillment, growth of
our secure shredding operations, and acquisitions. In addition, favorable
currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2006 in Canada
increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $9.8 million when compared
to the year ended December 31, 2005. Contribution as a percent of segment
revenue decreased in the year ended December 31, 2006 due mainly to (a) higher
transportation costs, primarily fuel and rental costs associated with a larger
fleet of leased vehicles, and the accelerated implementation of a fleet-wide
maintenance program in North America, (b) increased facility costs,
primarily utilities, maintenance and insurance, (c) increased investment
in sales, marketing and account management primarily related to a shift in
hiring more experienced personnel at a higher cost, (d) costs associated
with the North American reorganization, including a new level of field
management, and (e) costs associated with our enterprise-wide sales
meeting and a field operations meeting, both held in 2006 but not in 2005.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, revenue
in our North American Physical Business segment increased 10.2% primarily due
to increasing storage internal growth rates resulting from higher net volume
growth and a more positive pricing environment, increasing service revenue
growth rates, growth of our secure shredding operations, higher internal growth
rates from product sales and acquisitions. In addition,


favorable currency
fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2005 in Canada increased
revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $8.7 million when compared to the year
ended December 31, 2004. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue
decreased in the year ended December 31, 2005 due to our (a) increased
investment in sales, marketing and account management, including higher sales
commissions and compensation due to increased headcount, (b) increased bad
debt expense, (c) increased incentive compensation expense, (d) higher
transportation costs, primarily fuel, and (e) product sales at lower
margins, offset by strong revenue growth, reduced facility expenses and the
effectiveness of recent labor and cost management initiatives, including
controls over overhead spending implemented in late 2004. The expansion of our
secure shredding business, which incurs lower facilities costs than our core physical
business, also lowers our facilities costs as a percentage of revenues.

Included in our North
American Physical Business segment are certain costs related to staff
functions, including finance, human resources and information technology, which
benefit the enterprise as a whole. These costs are primarily related to the
general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and
development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in
the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of
implementation. Management has decided to allocate these costs to the North
American segment as further allocation is impracticable.

Revenue in our International Physical Business segment
increased 24.0% during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to
acquisitions, which contributed $92.0 million or 18.6%. This was partially
offset by net unfavorable currency fluctuations in Europe and Latin America of
$6.3 million or 1.5% during the year ended December 31, 2006. The balance
of the increase in revenue represents internal growth. Contribution as a
percent of segment revenue decreased primarily due to the acquisition
of two shredding businesses in the U.K. that operate at lower margins, the
acquisition of Pickfords, which is in the process of rationalizing its real
estate portfolio, and costs associated with the facility fire in London,
England.

Revenue in our
International Physical Business segment increased 14.5% during the year ended December 31,
2005 primarily due to acquisitions completed in Europe and in South America and
strong internal growth in Latin America, offset by lower revenue in our U.K.
public sector business. Favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31,
2005 in Europe, Mexico and South America increased revenue, as measured in U.S.
dollars, by $13.8 million compared to the year ended December 31,


2004.
Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to
improvements in both cost of sales and overhead labor ratios as a result of
completing the integration of Hays IMS in the second half of 2004 offset by
increased compensation associated with additional sales, marketing, and account
management personnel, several new marketing and promotional efforts, and
increased bad debt expense.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, revenue
in our Worldwide Digital Business segment increased 23.4% primarily due to
internal growth of 16%, primarily attributable to growth in digital storage revenue
and our online backup service offerings for both personal computer and server
data. The internal growth rate of our digital business was offset by a large
data restoration project in the third quarter of 2005, which was not repeated
in 2006 but drove the increase in the digital storage growth rate beginning in
the fourth quarter of 2005. The acquisition of LiveVault in December 2005
contributed approximately $12 million in revenue during the year ended December 31,
2006. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased primarily due to
the acquisition of LiveVault, increased investment in the European sales force,
increases in information technology costs, including the write-off of $5.9
million of previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs,
associated with internal use software development projects that were
discontinued, and the benefit of a large data restoration project in the third
quarter of 2005. This decrease was offset by higher absorption of fixed costs
as a result of increased revenues and a reduction in royalty payments.

During the year ended December 31,
2005, revenue in our Worldwide Digital Business segment increased 128.8%
primarily due to the acquisition of Connected in November 2004, which
represents an increase of $33.7 million over the partial year of revenue
recorded in 2004 and strong internal growth of 41%, including the impact
of a large data restoration project completed in 2005. Contribution as a
percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to strong revenue growth and
improved overhead leverage, partially offset by increases in information
technology costs, the acquisitions of Connected and LiveVault and associated
research and development activities and the growth of our sales and account
management force, including higher sales commissions.

Net cash provided by operating activities was
$377.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $374.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease resulted primarily from
an increase in operating income and non-cash items, such as depreciation offset
by gain on foreign currency, and further offset by the net change in working
capital. The net change in working capital is primarily associated with the
timing of accounts payable payments.

Due to the nature of our businesses, we make
significant capital expenditures and additions to customer acquisition costs.
Our capital expenditures are primarily related to growth and include
investments in storage systems, information systems and discretionary
investments in real estate. Cash paid for our capital expenditures and
additions to customer acquisition costs during the year ended December 31,
2006 amounted to $382.0 million and $14.3 million, respectively. From time to
time and in the normal course of business we sell certain fixed assets,
primarily real estate. In the year ended December 31, 2006, we received $17.8 million
of net proceeds from the sales of assets. For the year ended December 31,
2005 and 2006, capital expenditures, net and additions to customer acquisition
costs were funded primarily with cash flows provided by operating activities.
Excluding acquisitions, we expect our capital expenditures to be between $390
million and $420 million in the year ending December 31, 2007. Included in
our estimated capital expenditures for 2007 is $50 million to $60 million of
opportunity driven real estate purchases.

In the year ended December 31, 2006, we paid net
cash consideration of $81.2 million for acquisitions, primarily related to the
acquisition of two shredding businesses in the U.K., the buyout of minority
partners in France and Mexico and contingent payments associated with a
shredding acquisition in the U.S. and another acquisition in Europe. Cash flows
provided from operating activities, borrowings under our revolving credit
facilities, the proceeds from the sale of senior subordinated notes, and cash
equivalents on-hand funded these acquisitions.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $82.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2006. During the year ended
December 31, 2006, we had gross borrowings under our revolving credit
facilities and term loan facilities of $543.9 million, $282.0 million of
net proceeds from the sale of Senior Subordinated Notes and $22.2 million of
proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan.
We used the proceeds from these financing transactions to repay debt and term
loans ($655.0 million), repurchase $78.1 million of our 8

(1)

All intercompany notes
and the capital stock of most of our U.S. subsidiaries are pledged to secure
these debt instruments.

(2)

Most of IME’s
non-dormant subsidiaries have either guaranteed this indebtedness or their
shares of capital stock and intercompany indebtedness have been pledged
to secure this indebtedness. Iron Mountain has not guaranteed or otherwise
provided security for this indebtedness nor have any of Iron Mountain’s U.S.,
Canadian, Asia Pacific, Mexican or South American subsidiaries.

(3)

These debt instruments
are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by
substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries
(the “Guarantors”). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the
Guarantors. The remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee these debt
instruments.

Our indentures use OIBDA-based calculations as primary
measures of financial performance, including leverage ratios. Our key bond
leverage ratio, as calculated per our bond indentures, was 5.0 as of
December 31, 2005 and 4.6 as of December 31, 2006. Noncompliance with
this leverage ratio would have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and liquidity. Our target for this ratio is generally in the range of
4.5 to 5.5 while the maximum ratio allowable under the bond indentures
is 6.5.

Our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our
indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and
capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial,
competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our
control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow
from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable
terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our
indebtedness, or to make necessary capital expenditures.


In March 2004, IME and certain of its
subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the “IME Credit Agreement”) with
a syndicate of European lenders. The IME Credit Agreement provides for maximum
borrowing availability in the principal amount of 200 million British pounds
sterling, including a 100 million British pounds sterling revolving credit
facility (the “IME revolving credit facility”), which includes the ability to
borrow in certain other foreign currencies and a 100 million British pounds
sterling term loan (the “IME term loan facility”). The IME revolving credit
facility matures on March 5, 2009. The IME term loan facility is payable
in three installments; two installments of 20 million British pounds sterling
on March 5, 2007 and 2008, respectively, and the final payment of the
remaining balance on March 5, 2009. The interest rate on borrowings under
the IME Credit Agreement varies depending on IME’s choice of currency options
and interest rate period, plus an applicable margin. The IME Credit Agreement
includes various financial covenants applicable to the results of IME, which
may restrict IME’s ability to incur indebtedness under the IME Credit Agreement
and from third parties, as well as limit IME’s ability to pay dividends to us.
Most of IME’s non-dormant subsidiaries have either guaranteed the obligations
or have their shares pledged to secure IME’s obligations under the IME Credit
Agreement. We have not guaranteed or otherwise provided security for the IME
Credit Agreement nor have any of our U.S., Canadian, Asia Pacific, Mexican or
South American subsidiaries. Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
2006 includes 77 million British pounds sterling and 94.7 million Euro of
borrowings (totaling $266.8 million) under the IME Credit Agreement; we
also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling 1.7 million British
pounds sterling ($3.2 million). The remaining availability, based on IME’s current
leverage ratio which is calculated based on current earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and current external debt,
under the IME revolving credit facility on October 31, 2006, was
approximately 59.0 million British pounds sterling ($112.1 million).
The interest rate in effect under the IME revolving credit facility ranged from
4.4% to 6.2% as of October 31, 2006.

On April 2, 2004 and subsequently on July 8,
2004, we entered into a new amended and restated revolving credit facility and
term loan facility (the “IMI Credit Agreement”) to replace our prior credit
agreement and to reflect more favorable pricing of our term loans. The IMI
Credit Agreement had an aggregate principal amount of $550 million and was
comprised of a $350 million revolving credit facility (the “IMI revolving
credit facility”), which included the ability to borrow in certain foreign
currencies, and a $200 million term loan facility (the “IMI term loan facility”).
The IMI revolving credit facility matures on April 2, 2009. With respect
to the IMI term loan facility, quarterly loan payments of $0.5 million began in
the third quarter of 2004 and will continue through maturity on April 2,
2011, at which time the remaining outstanding principal balance of the IMI term
loan facility is due. In November 2004, we entered into an additional $150
million of term loans as permitted under our IMI Credit Agreement. The new term
loans will mature at the same time as our current IMI term loan facility with
quarterly loan payments of $0.4 million that began in the first quarter of
2005 and are priced at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.75%. On October 31, 2005,
we entered into the second amendment to the IMI Credit Agreement, increasing
availability under the revolving credit facility from $350 million to $400
million. As a result, the IMI Credit Agreement had an aggregate maximum
principal amount of $750 million as of December 31, 2006. The interest
rate on borrowings under the IMI Credit Agreement varies depending on our
choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin. All
intercompany notes and the capital stock of most of our U.S. subsidiaries are
pledged to secure the IMI Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2006, we
had $170.5 million of borrowings under our IMI revolving credit facility, of
which $4 million was denominated in U.S. dollars and the remaining balance was
denominated in Canadian dollars (“CAD”) (CAD 194 million); we also had various
outstanding letters of credit totaling $27.0 million. The remaining
availability, based on Iron Mountain’s current leverage ratio which is calculated
based on current EBITDA and current external debt, under the IMI revolving
credit facility on December 31, 2006, was $113.8 million. The interest
rate in effect under the IMI revolving credit facility and IMI term loan
facility ranged from 6.0% to 9.0% and 7.0% to 7.2%, respectively, as of December 31,
2006.


In July 2006, we completed an underwritten public
offering of $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8


¤


% Senior Subordinated Notes
due 2018, which were issued at par. Our net proceeds of $196.6 million, after
paying the underwriters’ discounts, commissions and transaction fees, were used
to (a) fund our offer to purchase and consent solicitation of $78.1
million in aggregate principle amount of our outstanding 8


¤


% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011, (b) fund
our purchase in the open market of $33.0 million in aggregate principal amount
of our 8


¤


% Senior Subordinated Notes
due 2013 and (c) repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As
a result, we recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $2.8 million
in the third quarter of 2006 related to the early extinguishment of the 8

¤


% Senior Subordinated Notes, which
consists of tender premiums and transaction costs, deferred financing costs, as

In July 2006, we experienced a significant fire
in a records and information management facility in London, England that
resulted in the complete destruction of the leased facility. London fire
authorities recently issued a report in which it was concluded that the fire resulted
from a deliberate act of arson; the report also stated that the actions of a
guard employed by a third-party security service contractor resulted in the
disabling of the automatic sprinkler system in the building. We believe we
carry adequate property and liability insurance and are in the process of
assessing the cause of, and other circumstances involved with, the fire. We do
not expect that this event will have a material impact to our consolidated
results of operations or financial condition. Revenues from this facility
represent less than 1% of our consolidated enterprise revenues. As of December 31,
2006, we have approximately $9.6 million recorded as an insurance receivable
which is included in prepaid expenses and other in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet which primarily represents the net book value of the
property, plant and equipment associated with this facility at the time of the
incident, net of $1.8 million of property insurance proceeds received through
IME’s October 31, 2006 fiscal year-end. Subsequent to IME’s October 31,
2006 fiscal year-end, IME received payment from our insurance carrier of
approximately 8.6 million British pounds sterling ($16.9 million). We expect to
utilize cash received from our insurance carriers to fund capital expenditures
and for general working capital needs. Such amount represents a portion of our
business personal property, business interruption, and expense claims with our
insurance carrier. We will record approximately $8.8 million to other (income)
expense, net in the first quarter of 2007 related to recoveries associated with
our business interruption portion of our insurance claim to date. We expect to
settle the remaining property portion of our insurance claim with our insurance
carriers within the next twelve months and have, therefore, classified the
remaining insurance receivable as a current asset. We expect to receive recoveries
related to our property claim with our insurance carriers that will exceed the
carrying value of such assets. We, therefore, expect to record gains on the
disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net in our statement of
operations in future periods when the cash received to date exceeds the
remaining carrying value of the related property, plant and equipment, net. Recoveries
from the insurance carriers related to business personal property claims are
reflected in our statement of cash flows under proceeds from sales of property
and equipment and other, net included in investing activities section when
received. Recoveries from the insurance carriers related to business
interruption claims are reflected in our statement of cash flows as a component
of net income included in the operating activities section when received.

In October 2006, we issued, in a private
placement, $50 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2018, which were issued at a price of 99.3% of par; and
30 million Euro in aggregate principal amount of our 6


¤


% Euro Senior Subordinated
Notes due 2018, which were issued at a price of 99.5% of par. Our net
proceeds of $85.5 million, after sales commission, were used to repay
outstanding indebtedness under the IMI term loan and IME revolving credit
facilities.

The IME Credit Agreement, IMI Credit Agreement, our
indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain
restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that


restrict our ability to
complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make
investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The
covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating
would not trigger a default under the IME Credit Agreement, IMI Credit
Agreement and our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness.
We were in compliance with all debt covenants in material agreements as of December 31,
2006.

In January 2007, we
completed an offering of 225.0 million Euro in aggregate principal amount of
our 6


¤


% Euro Senior Subordinated
Notes due 2018, which were issued at a price of 98.99% of par and priced to
yield 6.875%. Our net proceeds of 219.2 million Euro ($283.8 million), after
paying the underwriters’ discounts and commissions and estimated expenses
(excluding accrued interest payable by purchasers of the notes from October 17,
2006). These net proceeds were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the
IMI term loan and revolving credit facilities. We recorded a charge to other
(income) expense, net of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2007 related to
the early retirement of the IMI term loans, representing the write-off of a
portion of our deferred financing costs. In addition, in January 2007, we
entered into forward contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for 96 million Euros
and 194 million CAD for 127.5 million Euros to hedge our intercompany exposures
with Canada and our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Euro. These
forward contracts settle on a monthly basis, at which time we enter into new
forward contracts for the same underlying amounts, to continue to hedge
movements in CAD and Euros against the U.S. dollar. At the time of settlement,
we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract.

In addition, in
connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn-out
obligations that may be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet
certain operational objectives. These payments are based on the future results
of these operations, and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn-out
payments we may be required to make under all such agreements as of December 31,
2006 is approximately $6.6 million.

We expect to meet our cash
flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from
operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, borrowings under the IMI and IME
revolving credit facilities and other financings, which may include secured credit
facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. We expect
to meet our long-term cash flow requirements using the same means described


above,
as well as the potential issuance of debt or equity securities as we deem
appropriate. See Notes 4, 7 and 10 to Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

We have no off-balance
sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4)(ii).

Net Operating Loss
Carryforwards

We have federal net
operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2018 through 2021 of
$172.7 million at December 31, 2006 to reduce future federal taxable
income, if any. We also have an asset for state net operating loss of $18.2
million (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to expire in 2007 through
2024, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 98%. As a result of
these loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay any significant U.S. federal
and state income taxes in 2007.

Inflation

Certain of our expenses,
such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and
replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we
have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased
operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long-term real estate
leases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future
inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased
storage or service charges.

Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Interest Rate Risk

Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the
long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to
use long term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby
helping to preserve our long term returns on invested capital. We target a
range 80% to 85% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest
rates. Occasionally, we will use floating to fixed interest rate swaps as a
tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. As part of this
strategy, in May 2001 and June 2006 we and IME entered into a total
of two derivative financial contracts, which are variable-for-fixed interest
rate swaps consisting of (a)  one contract based on interest payments
previously payable on our real estate term loans of an aggregate principal
amount of $97.0 million that have been subsequently repaid, and (b) one
contract for interest payments payable on IME’s term loan facility of an
aggregate principal amount of 75.0 million British pounds sterling. See
Note 3 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

After consideration of the
swap contracts mentioned above, as of December 31, 2006, we had
$517.9 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average
variable interest rate of 6.4%, and $2,150.9 million of fixed rate debt
outstanding. As of December 31, 2006, 80.6% of our total debt outstanding
was fixed. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate
debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31,
2006 would have been reduced by $2.9 million. See Note 4 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for a
discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such
indebtedness as of December 31, 2006.

Currency Risk

Our investments in IME, Iron Mountain Canada
Corporation (“IM Canada”), Iron Mountain Mexico, SA de RL de CV, IMSA and other
international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to
fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar.
However, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the
currencies of the countries in which we operate,


primarily the Euro,
Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. The currencies of many Latin
American countries, particularly the Argentine peso, have experienced
substantial volatility and depreciation. Declines in the value of the local
currencies in which we are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues
in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase
in local currency.

The impact on our earnings is mitigated somewhat by
the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in
the local currency. We also have several intercompany obligations between our
foreign subsidiaries and Iron Mountain and our U.S.-based subsidiaries and our
foreign subsidiaries and IME. These intercompany obligations are primarily
denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary.

We have adopted and implemented a number of strategies
to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. One
strategy is to finance our largest international subsidiaries with local debt
that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. In
determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax
strategies among other factors. Another strategy we utilize is to borrow in
foreign currencies at the U.S. parent level to hedge our intercompany financing
activities. Finally, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily
or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to
lock in certain transaction economics. We have implemented these strategies for
our three foreign investments in the U.K., Canada and Asia Pacific.
Specifically, through IME borrowing under the IME Credit Agreement and our
150 million British pounds sterling denominated 7


¤


% Senior
Subordinated Notes, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany
loan with IME. IM Canada has financed their capital needs through direct
borrowings in Canadian dollars under the IMI revolving credit facility. This
creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. To fund the acquisition of
Pickfords in Australia and New Zealand, Iron Mountain borrowed Australian and
New Zealand dollars under its multi-currency revolving credit facility. These
borrowings provided a tax efficient natural hedge against the intercompany
loans created at the time of the acquisition. Subsequently, we repaid such
borrowings under our multi-currency revolving credit facility and
contemporaneously in September 2006, we entered into forward contracts to
exchange U.S. dollars for 55 million in Australian dollars (“AUD”) and 20.2
million in New Zealand dollars (“NZD”) to hedge our intercompany exposure in
these countries. In addition, in January, 2007 we entered into forward
contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for 96 million Euros and 194 million CAD for
127.5 million Euros to hedge our intercompany exposures with Canada and our
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Euro. These forward contracts
settle on a monthly basis, at which time we enter into new forward contracts
for the same underlying amounts, to continue to hedge movements in AUD, NZD,
CAD and Euros against the U.S. dollar. At the time of settlement, we either pay
or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract. As of December 31,
2006, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances
are unhedged.

The impact of devaluation
or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the
local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce
expenses. Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential
substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect
of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect of a change in foreign
exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in
the “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items, net” component of stockholders’
equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2006 functional currencies, relative to
the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction in our stockholders’ equity of
approximately $41.1 million.

Disclosure Controls
and Procedures

The term “disclosure
controls and procedures” is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These rules refer
to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure
that information is recorded, processed, summarized and communicated to
management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding what is required to be
disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act. As
of December 31, 2006 (the “Evaluation Date”), we carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that
evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have
concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and
procedures are effective.

Management’s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation
under the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006. Our management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which appears below.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Iron Mountain Incorporated:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, that Iron Mountain Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating


effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal
control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error
or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections
of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2006 of the Company and our report dated March 1,
2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and
includes an explanatory paragraph relating to the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R),

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Iron Mountain Incorporated

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Iron Mountain Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Iron
Mountain Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 2n, the Company adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

effective January 1, 2006.

We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated March 1, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2006

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

1. Nature of Business

On May 27, 2005, Iron Mountain Incorporated, a
Pennsylvania corporation (“Iron Mountain PA”), reincorporated as a Delaware
corporation. The reincorporation was effected by means of a statutory merger
(the “Merger”) of Iron Mountain PA with and into Iron Mountain Incorporated, a
Delaware corporation (“Iron Mountain DE”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Iron
Mountain PA. In connection with the Merger, Iron Mountain DE succeeded to and
assumed all of the assets and liabilities of Iron Mountain PA. Apart from the
change in its state of incorporation, the Merger had no effect on Iron Mountain
PA’s business, board composition, management, employees, fiscal year, assets or
liabilities, or location of its facilities, and did not result in any relocation
of management or other employees. The Merger was approved at the Annual Meeting
of Stockholders held on May 26, 2005. Upon consummation of the Merger,
Iron Mountain DE succeeded to Iron Mountain PA’s reporting obligations and
continued to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “IRM.”

On December 7, 2006, our board authorized and
approved a three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a dividend on our
common stock. We issued the additional shares of common stock resulting from
this stock dividend on December 29, 2006 to all stockholders of record as
of the close of business on December 18, 2006.

All share data has been
adjusted for such stock split.

The accompanying financial
statements represent the consolidated accounts of Iron Mountain Incorporated, a
Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. We are an international
full-service provider of information protection and storage and related
services for all media in various locations throughout the United States,
Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico and South America to commercial,
legal, banking, health care, accounting, insurance, entertainment and
government organizations, including more than 90% of the Fortune 1000 and more
than 85% of the FTSE 100.

2. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

a.      Principles
of Consolidation

The
accompanying financial statements reflect our financial position and results of
operations on a consolidated basis. Financial position and results of
operations of Iron Mountain Europe Limited (“IME”), our European subsidiary,
are consolidated for the appropriate periods based on its fiscal year ended October 31.
All significant intercompany account balances have been eliminated or presented
to reflect the underlying economics of the transactions.

b.     Use of
Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and for the period then ended. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the
estimates used, including those related to accounting for acquisitions,
allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos, impairments of tangible and
intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation and
self-insured liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience,
actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we
believe to be reasonable

under
the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

c.      Cash and
Cash Equivalents

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on hand and cash invested in short-term
securities which have remaining maturities at the date of purchase of less than
90 days. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates
fair value.

d.     Foreign
Currency

Local
currencies are considered the functional currencies for our operations outside
the United States, with the exception of certain foreign holding
companies, whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar. All assets and
liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates, and revenues and
expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the applicable period, in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 52,
“Foreign Currency Translation.” Resulting translation adjustments are reflected
in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of stockholders’ equity.

net, on our consolidated statements of operations. The total of such net gain
amounted to $8,915, a net loss of $7,201 and a net gain of $12,534 for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.

e.      Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” requires that every derivative instrument
be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at
its fair value. Periodically, we acquire derivative instruments that are
intended to hedge either cash flows or values which are subject to foreign
exchange or other market price risk, and not for trading purposes. We have
formally documented our hedging relationships, including identification of the
hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives
and strategies for undertaking each hedge transaction. Given the recurring
nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the
ability and the preference to use long term, fixed interest rate debt to
finance our business, thereby preserving our long term returns on invested
capital. We target a range 80% to 85% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with
respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we will use floating to fixed interest
rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. In
addition, we will use borrowings in foreign currencies, either obtained in the
U.S. or by our foreign subsidiaries, to naturally hedge foreign

risk associated with our international investments. Sometimes we enter into
currency swaps to temporarily hedge an overseas investment, such as a major
acquisition, while we arrange permanent financing or to hedge our exposures
related to foreign currency exchange movements related to our intercompany
accounts with and between our foreign subsidiaries.

f.      Property,

Minor maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Major
improvements which extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety
or the efficiency of property owned are capitalized. Major improvements to
leased buildings are capitalized as leasehold improvements and depreciated.

We develop various software applications for internal
use. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with,
and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software
projects (to the extent of the time spent directly on the project) are
capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position 98-1, “Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use” (“SOP 98-1”).
Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been
completed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to
perform the function intended. Capitalized software costs are depreciated over
the estimated useful life of the software beginning when

the software is placed in
service. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we wrote-off $6,329 of
previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with
internal use software development projects that were discontinued, and such
costs are included as a component of selling, general and administrative
expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” (“FIN 47”), an interpretation of
SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (“SFAS No. 143”).
FIN 47 clarifies that conditional asset retirement obligations meet the
definition of liabilities and should be recognized when incurred if their fair
values can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty surrounding the timing and
method of settlement that may be conditional on events occurring in the future
are factored into the measurement of the liability rather than the existence of
the liability. SFAS No. 143 established accounting and reporting standards
for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets
legally required by law, regulatory rule or contractual agreement and the
associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to
record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the
period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the
entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related
long-lived asset, which is then depreciated over the useful life of the related
asset. The liability is increased over time through income such that the
liability will equate to the future cost to retire the long-lived asset at the
expected retirement date. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either
settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon
settlement. Our obligations are primarily the result of requirements under our
facility lease agreements which generally have “return to original condition”
clauses which would require us to remove or restore items such as shred pits,
vaults, demising walls and office build-outs, among others. As of December 31,
2005, we have recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying FIN 47 as
a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as prescribed in FIN 47.
The impact of adopting FIN 47 as of December 31, 2005 was a gross charge
of $4,422 ($2,751, net of tax), an increase in property, plant and equipment,
net of $1,889 and long-term liabilities of $6,311. The significant
assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are
the timing of removals, estimated cost and associated expected inflation rates
that are consistent with historical rates and credit-adjusted risk-free rates
that approximate our incremental borrowing rate.

A
reconciliation of liabilities for asset retirement obligations is as follows:

6,311

Liabilities

Liabilities
  Settled

)

Had we applied the provisions of FIN 47 as of January 1,
2004, the pro forma impacts on net income and basic and diluted earnings per
common share would not be material for 2004 and 2005.

g.      Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

We apply the provisions of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets.” Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed
annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.
Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives are
amortized over their useful lives.

We have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill
impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as
of October 1, 2004, 2005 and 2006 and noted no impairment of goodwill. In
making this assessment, we rely on a number of factors including operating
results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows,
transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to
these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill
impairment. As of December 31, 2006, no factors were identified that would
alter this assessment. Our reporting units at which level we performed our
goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2006 were as follows: 
North America excluding Fulfillment, Fulfillment, U.K., Continental Europe, Worldwide
Digital Business excluding Iron Mountain Intellectual Property Management, Inc.
(“IPM”), IPM, South America, Mexico and Asia Pacific. When changes occur
in the composition of one or more reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned
to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair value.

Goodwill valuations have been calculated using an
income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each
reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future
growth rates, discount factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax
cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these
assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods.

h.     Long-Lived
Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” we review long-lived assets
and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted
undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to
their carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the
business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation
is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then
intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long-lived
assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is determined based on
discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the
assets.

Consolidated gains on
disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $681 for the year
ended December 31, 2004, consisted primarily of a gain on the sale of a
property in Florida during the second quarter of 2004 of approximately $1,200
offset by disposals and asset writedowns. Consolidated gains on
disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $3,485 for the year
ended December 31, 2005, consisted primarily of a gain on the sale of a
facility in the U.K. during the fourth quarter of 2005 of approximately $4,500
offset by software asset writedowns. Consolidated gains on disposal/writedown
of property, plant and equipment, net of $9,560 in the year ended December 31,

consisted
primarily of a gain on the sale of a facility in the U.K. in the fourth quarter
of 2006 of approximately $10,499 offset by disposals and asset writedowns.

i.      Customer
Relationships and Acquisition Costs and Other Intangible Assets

Costs related to the acquisition of large volume
accounts, net of revenues received for the initial transfer of the records, are
capitalized. Costs incurred to transport the boxes to one of our facilities,
which includes labor and transportation charges, are amortized over periods
ranging from five to 30 years (weighted average of 27 years at December 31,
2006) and are included in depreciation and amortization in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. Payments to a customer’s current records
management vendor or direct payments to a customer are amortized over
approximately 5 years to the storage and service revenue line items in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations. If the customer terminates
its relationship with us, the unamortized cost is charged to expense or
revenue. However, in the event of such termination, we generally collect, and
record as income, permanent removal fees that generally equal or exceed the
amount of the unamortized costs. Customer relationship intangible assets
acquired through business combinations, which represents the majority of the
balance, are amortized over periods ranging from six to 30 years (weighted
average of 19 years at December 31, 2006). Amounts allocated in purchase
accounting to customer relationship intangible assets are calculated based upon
estimates of their fair value. As of December 31, 2005 and 2006, the gross
carrying amount of customer relationships and acquisition costs was $264,728
and $339,591, respectively, and accumulated amortization of those costs was
$35,722 and $56,835, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2004,
2005 and 2006, amortization expense was $10,044, $12,910 and $16,292,
respectively, included in depreciation and amortization in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31,
2006, the charge to revenues associated with large volume accounts was $3,681,
which represents the level anticipated over the next 5 years.

Other intangible assets, including noncompetition
agreements, acquired core technology and trademarks, are capitalized and
amortized over a weighted average period of eight years. As of December 31,
2005 and 2006, the gross carrying amount of other intangible assets was $30,094
and $32,985, respectively, and accumulated amortization of those costs was
$5,082 and $9,521, respectively, included in other in other assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December 31,
2004, 2005 and 2006, amortization expense was $1,638, $3,314 and $4,336,
respectively, included in depreciation and amortization in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.

Estimated amortization
expense for existing intangible assets (excluding deferred financing costs
which are amortized through interest expense) for the next five succeeding
fiscal years is as follows:

j.       Deferred
Financing Costs

Deferred
financing costs are amortized over the life of the related debt using the
effective interest rate method. If debt is retired early, the related
unamortized deferred financing costs are written off in the period the debt is
retired to other (income) expense, net. As of December 31, 2005 and 2006,
gross carrying amount of deferred financing costs was $46,697 and $50,775,
respectively, and accumulated amortization of those costs was $15,091 and $20,980,
respectively, and was recorded in other assets, net in the accompanying

l.      Revenues

Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as
service and storage material sales revenues. Storage revenues consist of
periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a
per unit or per cubic foot of records basis). Service and storage material
sales revenues are comprised of charges for related service activities and
courier operations and the sale of software licenses and storage materials.
Included in service and storage materials sales are related core service
revenues arising from: (a) the handling of records including the addition
of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed
records, destruction of records, and permanent withdrawls from storage; (b) courier
operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer
request; (c) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (d) other
recurring services including maintenance and support contracts. Our
complementary services revenues arise from special project work, including data
restoration, providing fulfillment services, consulting services and product
sales, including software licenses, specially designed storage containers,
magnetic media including computer tapes and related supplies.

We recognize revenue when
the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and
service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service
is provided and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on

contractually agreed-upon terms. Amounts related to
future storage or prepaid service contracts, including maintenance and support
contracts, for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance
are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the
applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Storage
material sales are recognized when shipped to the customer and include software
license sales (less than 1% of consolidated revenues in 2006). Sales of
software licenses to distributors are recognized at the time a distributor
reports that the software has been licensed to an end-user and all revenue
recognition criteria have been satisfied.

m.    Rent
Normalization

We
have entered into various leases for buildings. Certain leases have fixed
escalation clauses or other features which require normalization of the rental
expense over the life of the lease resulting in deferred rent being reflected
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we have assumed
various above and below market leases in connection with certain of our
acquisitions. The difference between the present value of these lease
obligations and the market rate at the date of the acquisition was recorded as
a deferred rent liability or other long-term asset and is being amortized over
the remaining lives of the respective leases.

n.     Stock-Based
Compensation

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R,
“Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123
and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB No. 25”). We adopted the measurement
provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as
amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition
and Disclosure” in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003
using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing
expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of
adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. We
have applied the fair value recognition provisions to all stock based awards
granted, modified or settled on or after January 1, 2003.

We adopted SFAS No. 123R effective January 1,
2006 using the modified prospective method, as permitted under SFAS No. 123R.
We record stock-based compensation expense, utilizing the straight-line method,
for the cost of stock options, restricted stock and shares issued under the
employee stock purchase plan (together, “Employee Stock-Based Awards”) based on
the requirements of SFAS No. 123R beginning January 1, 2006.

Stock-based compensation expense, included in the

decrease by $894, and net
income to decrease by $539, and had no impact on basic and diluted earnings per
share.

SFAS No. 123R also requires that the benefits
associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be
reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as
required under APB No. 25. This requirement reduces reported operating
cash flows and increases reported financing cash flows. As a result, net
financing cash flows included $4,387 for the year ended December 31, 2006,
from the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost.
Under prior accounting rules, this amount would have been included in net
operating cash flows. We used the short form method to calculate the Additional
Paid-in Capital (“APIC”) pool, the tax benefit of any resulting excess tax
deduction should increase the APIC pool; any resulting tax deficiency should be
deducted from the APIC pool.

Stock Options

Under our various stock option plans, options were
granted with exercise prices equal to the market price of the stock at the date
of grant. The majority of our options become exercisable ratably over a period
of five years and generally have a contractual life of 10 years, unless
the holder’s employment is terminated. Our Directors are considered employees
under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

A total of 29,112,685 shares of common stock have been
reserved for grants of options and other rights under our various stock
incentive plans. The number of shares available for grant at December 31,
2006 was 7,301,608.

The
weighted average fair value of options granted in 2004, 2005 and 2006 was
$8.58, $11.85 and $14.84 per share, respectively. The values were estimated on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following

rates whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options.
Expected dividend yield was not considered in the option pricing model since we
do not pay dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future. The
expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) of the stock options
granted was estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees.

Restricted Stock

Under our various stock option plans, we may also
issue grants of restricted stock. We granted restricted stock in July 2005
which had a 3-year vesting period. The fair value of restricted stock is
the excess of the market price of our common stock at the date of grant over
the exercise price, which is zero. Included in our stock-based compensation
expense for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 is a portion of the
cost related to restricted stock granted in July 2005. We did not
grant restricted stock in 2004 and 2006.

Employee Stock
Purchase Plan

We offer an employee stock purchase plan in which
participation is available to substantially all U.S. and Canadian employees who
meet certain service eligibility requirements (the “ESPP”). The ESPP provides a
way for our eligible employees to become stockholders on favorable terms. The
ESPP provides for the purchase of our common stock by eligible employees
through successive offering periods. We generally have two 6-month
offering periods, the first of which begins June 1 and ends November 30
and the second begins December 1 and ends May 31. During each
offering period, participating employees accumulate after-tax payroll
contributions, up to a maximum of 15% of their compensation, to pay the
exercise price of their options. Participating employees may withdraw from an
offering period before the purchase date and obtain a refund of the amounts
withheld as payroll deductions. At the end of the offering period, outstanding
options are exercised, and each employee’s accumulated contributions are used
to purchase our common stock. The price for shares purchased under the ESPP is
85% of the fair market price at either the beginning or the end of the offering
period, whichever is lower. The ESPP was amended and approved by our
stockholders on May 26, 2005 to increase the number of shares from
1,687,500 to 3,487,500. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and
2006, there were 522,480, 579,173 and 535,826 shares, respectively, purchased
under the ESPP. The number of shares available for purchase at December 31,
2006 was 1,650,413. Beginning with the December 1, 2006 ESPP offering
period, the price for shares purchased under the ESPP will be changed to 95% of
the fair market price at the end of the offering period without a look back
feature. As a result, we no longer need to recognize

compensation cost for our
ESPP shares purchased beginning with the December 1, 2006 offering period
and will, therefore, no longer have disclosure relative to our weighted average
assumptions associated with determining the fair value stock option expense in
our consolidated financial statements on a prospective basis relative to new
offering periods.

The
fair value of the ESPP offerings is estimated on the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the
following table for the respective periods. Expected volatility was calculated
utilizing daily historical volatility over a period that equates to the
expected life of the option. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S.
Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected life equates
to the 6-month offering period over which employees accumulate payroll
deductions to purchase our common stock. Expected dividend yield was not
considered in the option pricing model since we do not pay dividends and have
no current plans to do so in the future.

As of December 31, 2006, unrecognized
compensation cost related to the unvested portion of our Employee Stock-Based
Awards was $28,983 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 3.7 years.

We
generally issue shares for the exercises of stock options, issuance of
restricted stock and issuance of shares under our ESPP from unissued reserved
shares.

o.     Income
Taxes

We account for income
taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SFAS
No. 109”), which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the tax and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and for
loss and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when recovery
of deferred tax assets is not considered more likely than not.

p.     Income Per
Share—Basic and Diluted

In accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per
Share,” basic net income per common share is calculated by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The calculation of
diluted net income per share is consistent with that of basic net income per
share but gives

common shares (that is, securities such as options, warrants or convertible
securities) that were outstanding during the period, unless the effect is
antidilutive. Potential common shares,

attributable to stock options, included in the calculation of diluted net
income per share totaled 3,139,247, 2,116,623 and 2,347,203 shares for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Potential
common shares of 136,568, 961,407 and 725,398 for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively, have been excluded from the calculation of
diluted net income per share, as their effects are antidilutive.

q.     New
Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”), an interpretation
of SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income
taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109

.

FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.

The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with
FIN 48 is a two-step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby
the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals
or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The
second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more
likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of
benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured
at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being
realized upon ultimate settlement.

The provisions of FIN 48 are effective January 1,
2007. The provisions of FIN 48 are to be applied to all tax positions upon
initial adoption of this standard. Only tax positions that meet the more likely
than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or
continue to be recognized upon adoption of FIN 48. The cumulative effect of
applying the provisions of FIN 48 should be reported as an adjustment to the
opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year. We are in the
process of evaluating the effect of FIN 48 on our consolidated results of
operations and financial position.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
“Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under
other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements,
and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal
years. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a
material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

2. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies (Continued)

In
September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (“SAB 108”), “Considering the Effects of Prior
Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements,” which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the
carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in
quantifying a current year misstatement. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal
years ending after November 15, 2006. We have completed our analysis
related to the implementation of SAB 108 and have concluded it has no effect on
our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities-Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115”
(“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure
many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159
is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are in
the process of evaluating the effect of SFAS No. 159 on our consolidated
results of operations and financial position.

t.     Concentrations
of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that
potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
temporary cash investments and accounts receivable. We have no significant
concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2006.

u.     Available-for-sale
Securities

We have one trust that
holds marketable securities. Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale,
as defined by SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments and Debt
and Equity Securities.” As of December 31, 2005 and 2006, the fair value
of the money market and mutual funds included in this trust amounted to $5,917
and $7,414, respectively, included in prepaid expenses and other in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Included in other (income) expense,
net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were net realized
gains of $208, $127 and $336 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005
and 2006, respectively. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive items, net in the accompanying consolidated
statement of stockholder’s equity.

3. Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities

We previously entered into two interest rate swap
agreements, which were derivatives as defined by SFAS No. 133 and
designated as cash flow hedges. These swap agreements hedge interest rate risk
on certain amounts of our term loan. Both of these swap agreements expired in
the first quarter of 2006. As a result of the foregoing, for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2005 and 2006, we recorded additional interest expense of $8,460, $3,952
and $127 resulting from interest rate swap payments. We entered into a third
interest rate swap agreement, which was designated as a cash flow hedge. This
swap agreement hedged interest rate risk on certain amounts of our variable
operating lease commitments. This swap expired in March 2005. The total
impact of marking to market the fair market value of the derivative liability
and cash payments associated with this interest rate swap agreement resulted in
our recording additional interest expense of $1,246 and interest income of $6
for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively.

In connection with certain real estate loans, we
swapped $97,000 of floating rate debt to fixed rate debt. Since the time we
entered into the swap agreement, interest rates have fallen. As a result, the
estimated cost to terminate these swaps (fair value of derivative liability)
would be $2,458 and $760 at December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively,
included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As a result of the
repayment of the real estate term loans in the third quarter of 2004, we began
marking to market the fair value of the derivative liability through earnings.
The total impact of marking to market the fair market value of the derivative
liability and cash payments associated with the interest rate swap agreement resulted
in our recording interest expense of $11,565, interest income of $1,698 and interest
income of $646 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006,
respectively.

In July 2003, we provided the initial financing
totaling 190,459 British pounds sterling to IME for all of the consideration
associated with the acquisition of the European information management services

business of Hays plc (“Hays
IMS”) using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In
March 2004, IME repaid 135,000 British pounds sterling with proceeds from
their new credit agreement. We recorded a foreign currency gain of $11,866 in
other (income) expense, net for this intercompany balance in the first quarter
of 2004. In order to minimize the foreign currency risk associated with
providing IME with the consideration necessary for the acquisition of the
European operations of Hays IMS, we borrowed 80,000 British pounds sterling
under our revolving credit facility to create a natural hedge. In the first
quarter of 2004, these borrowings were repaid and we recorded a foreign
currency loss of $2,995 on the translation of this revolving credit balance to
U.S. dollars in other (income) expense, net.

In addition, on July 16, 2003, we entered into
two cross currency swaps with a combined notional value of 100,000 British
pounds sterling. We settled these swaps in March 2004 by paying our
counter parties a total of $27,714 representing the fair market value of the
derivative and the associated swap costs, of which $18,978 was accrued for as
of December 31, 2003. In the first quarter of 2004, we recorded a foreign
currency loss for this swap of $8,736 in other (income) expense, net in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Upon cash payment, we
received $162,800 in exchange for 100,000 British pounds sterling. We did not
designate these swaps as hedges and, therefore, all mark to market fluctuations
of the swaps were recorded in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated
statements of operations from inception to cash payment of the swaps.

In April 2004, IME entered into two floating for
fixed interest rate swap contracts, each with a notional value of 50,000
British pounds sterling and a duration of two years, which were designated as
cash flow hedges. These swap agreements hedged interest rate risk on IME’s
100,000 British pounds sterling term loan facility. Both of these swap
agreements expired in the second quarter of 2006. We have recorded, in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet, the fair value of the derivative
liability, a deferred tax asset and a corresponding charge to accumulated other
comprehensive items of $207 (recorded in accrued expenses), $68 and $139,
respectively, as of December 31, 2005. For the years ended December 31,
2004, 2005 and 2006, we recorded additional interest expense of $202, $32 and
$184 resulting from interest rate swap cash payments.

In June 2006, IME entered into a floating for
fixed interest rate swap contract with a notional value of 75,000 British
pounds sterling, which will expire on March 2008 and was designated as a
cash flow hedge. This swap agreement hedges interest rate risk on IME’s British
pounds multi-currency term loan facility. The notional value of the swap will
decline to 60,000 British pounds sterling in March 2007 to match the
remaining term loan amount outstanding as of that date. We have recorded, in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, the fair value of the derivative
liability, a deferred tax asset and a corresponding charge to accumulated other
comprehensive items of $364 ($273 recorded in accrued expenses and $91 recorded
in other long-term liabilities), $109 and $255, respectively, as of December 31,
2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded additional
interest expense of $124 resulting from interest rate swap cash payments.

In September 2006, we
entered into a forward contract program to exchange U.S. dollars for 55,000 in
Australian dollars (“AUD”) and 20,200 in New Zealand dollars (“NZD”) to hedge
our intercompany

exposure
in these countries. These forward contracts settle on a monthly basis, at which
time we enter into new forward contracts for the same underlying AUD and NZD
amounts, to continue to hedge movements in AUD and NZD against the U.S. dollar.
At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount
from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income),
net in the accompanying statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange
gain or loss. We have not designated these forward contracts as hedges. We
recorded a realized loss of $3,179 for the year ended December 31, 2006.
At the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market
and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market
valuation. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded an unrealized
foreign exchange loss of $303 in other expense (income), net in the
accompanying statement of operations.

a.      Revolving
Credit Facility and Term Loans

In March 2004, IME and certain of its
subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the “IME Credit Agreement”) with
a syndicate of European lenders. The IME Credit Agreement provides for maximum


IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

4. Debt

(Continued)

borrowing availability in
the principal amount of 200,000 British pounds sterling, including a 100,000 British
pounds sterling revolving credit facility (the “IME revolving credit facility”),
which includes the ability to borrow in certain other foreign currencies and a
100,000 British pounds sterling term loan (the “IME term loan facility”). The
IME revolving credit facility matures on March 5, 2009. The IME term loan
facility is payable in three installments; two installments of 20,000 British
pounds sterling on March 5, 2007 and 2008, respectively, and the final
payment of the remaining balance on March 5, 2009. The interest rate on
borrowings under the IME Credit Agreement varies depending on IME’s choice of
currency options and interest rate period, plus an applicable margin. The IME
Credit Agreement includes various financial covenants applicable to the results
of IME, which may restrict IME’s ability to incur indebtedness under the IME Credit
Agreement and from third parties, as well as limit IME’s ability to pay
dividends to us. Most of IME’s non-dormant subsidiaries have either guaranteed
the obligations or have their shares pledged to secure IME’s obligations under
the IME Credit Agreement. We have not guaranteed or otherwise provided security
for the IME Credit Agreement nor have any of our U.S., Canadian, Asia Pacific,
Mexican or South American subsidiaries. Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
2006 included 77,000 British pounds sterling and 94,725 Euro of borrowings
(totaling $266,824) under the IME Credit Agreement; we also had various
outstanding letters of credit totaling 1,686 British pounds sterling ($3,202).
The remaining availability, based on IME’s current leverage ratio which is
calculated based on current earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (“EBITDA”) and current external debt, under the IME revolving
credit facility on October 31, 2006, was approximately 59,000 British
pounds sterling ($112,100). The interest rates in effect under the
IME revolving credit facility ranged from 4.4% to 6.2% as of October 31,
2006. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, we recorded
commitment fees of $396, $806 and $477, respectively, based on 0.9% (for 2004
and 2005) and 0.6% (for 2006) of unused balances under the IME revolving credit
facility.

On April 2, 2004 and subsequently on July 8,
2004, we entered into a new amended and restated revolving credit facility and
term loan facility (the “IMI Credit Agreement”) to replace our prior credit
agreement and to reflect more favorable pricing of our term loans. The IMI
Credit Agreement had an aggregate principal amount of $550,000 and was
comprised of a $350,000 revolving credit facility (the “IMI revolving
credit facility”), which included the ability to borrow in certain foreign
currencies, and a $200,000 term loan facility (the “IMI term loan facility”).
The IMI revolving credit facility matures on April 2, 2009. With respect
to the IMI term loan facility, quarterly loan payments of $500 began in the
third quarter of 2004 and will continue through maturity on April 2, 2011,
at which time the remaining outstanding principal balance of the IMI term loan
facility is due. In November 2004, we entered into an additional $150,000
of term loans as permitted under our IMI Credit Agreement. The new term loans
will mature at the same time as our current IMI term loan facility with
quarterly loan payments of $375 that began in the first quarter of 2005. On October 31,
2005, we entered into the second amendment to the IMI Credit Agreement,
increasing availability under the revolving credit facility from $350,000 to
$400,000. As a result, the IMI Credit Agreement had an aggregate maximum
principal amount of $750,000 as of December 31, 2006. The interest
rate on borrowings under the IMI Credit Agreement varies depending on our
choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin. All
intercompany notes and the capital stock of most of our U.S. subsidiaries are
pledged to secure the IMI Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2005,
we had $216,396 of borrowings under our IMI revolving

credit facility, of which
$9,000 was denominated in U.S. dollars and the remaining balance was
denominated in Canadian dollars (“CAD”) (CAD 168,328) and in AUD 86,250; we
also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $23,974. As of December 31,
2006, we had $170,472 of borrowings under our IMI revolving credit facility, of
which $4,000 was denominated in U.S. dollars and the remaining balance was
denominated in CAD 194,000; we also had various outstanding letters of credit
totaling $26,980. The remaining availability, based on Iron Mountain’s current leverage
ratio which is calculated based on current EBITDA and current external debt, under
the IMI revolving credit facility on December 31, 2006, was $113,775. The
interest rate in effect under the IMI revolving credit facility and IMI term
loan facility ranged from 6.0% to 9.0% and 7.0% to 7.2%, respectively, as of December 31,
2006. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, we recorded
commitment fees of $1,112, $846 and $558, respectively, based on 0.5% (for 2004
and 2005) and 0.4% (for 2006) of unused balances under the IMI revolving credit
facility.

The IME Credit Agreement,
IMI Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our
indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants,
including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay
cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take
certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger.
Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the
IME Credit Agreement, IMI Credit Agreement and our indentures and other
agreements governing our indebtedness. We were in compliance with all debt
covenants in material agreements as of December 31, 2006.

b.     Notes

The senior subordinated notes are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by substantially all of our direct
and indirect 100% owned U.S. subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”). These guarantees
are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The remainder of our
subsidiaries do not guarantee the senior subordinated notes.

In July 2006, we completed an underwritten public
offering of $200,000 in aggregate principal amount of our 8


¤


% notes, which were issued
at par. Our net proceeds of $196,608, after paying the underwriters’ discounts,
commissions and transaction fees, were used to (a) fund our offer to
purchase and consent solicitation of $78,119 in aggregate principal amount of
our outstanding 8

% notes, (b) fund our
purchase in the open market of $33,000 in aggregate principal amount of our 8


¤


% notes and (c) repay
borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As a result, we recorded a
charge to other expense (income), net of $2,779 in the third quarter of 2006
related to the early extinguishment of the 8

% and 8


¤


% notes, which consists of tender
premiums and transaction costs, deferred financing costs, as well as original
issue discounts and premiums related to the 8

% notes.

In October 2006, we issued, in a private
placement, $50,000 in aggregate principal amount of our 8% notes, which
were issued at a price of 99.3% of par; and 30,000 Euro in aggregate principal
amount of our 6


¤


% notes, which were issued at a price of
99.5% of par. Our net proceeds of $85,492, after sales commission, were
used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the IMI term loan and IME
revolving credit facilities.

Each of the indentures for the notes provides that we
may redeem the outstanding notes, in whole or in part, upon satisfaction of
certain terms and conditions. In any redemption, we are also required to pay
all accrued but unpaid interest on the outstanding notes.

repurchases upon the occurrence of a Change of Control or in the event of
certain asset sales, each as described in the respective indenture, we are not
required to make sinking fund or redemption payments with respect to any of the
notes.

Our indentures and other agreements governing our
indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants
including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay
cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take
certain other corporate actions. The

covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore,
a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under our indentures
and other agreements governing our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2006,
we were in compliance with all debt covenants in material agreements.

c.      Real
Estate Mortgages

In
connection with the purchase of real estate and acquisitions, we assumed
several mortgages on real property. The mortgages bear interest at rates
ranging from 2.8% to 8.3% and are payable in various installments through 2023.

d.     Seller
Notes

In
connection with the merger with Pierce Leahy in 2000, we assumed debt related
to certain existing notes as a result of acquisitions which Pierce Leahy
completed in 1999. The notes bear interest at a rate of 4.75% per year. The
outstanding balance of 4,470 British pounds sterling ($8,757) on these notes at
December 31, 2006 is due on demand through 2009 and is classified as a current
portion of long-term debt.

e.      Other

Other long-term debt includes various notes, capital
leases and other obligations assumed by us as a result of certain acquisitions
and other agreements. The outstanding balance of $49,788 on these notes at December 31,
2006 have a weighted average interest rate of 9.1%.

IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2006

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

6. Acquisitions

The acquisitions we
consummated in 2004, 2005 and 2006 were accounted for using the purchase method
of accounting, and accordingly, the results of operations for each acquisition
have been included in our consolidated results from their respective
acquisition dates. Cash consideration for the various acquisitions was
primarily provided through borrowings under our credit facilities, the proceeds
from the sale of senior subordinated notes and cash equivalents on-hand. The
significant acquisitions are as follows:

For full access to all
future cash flows and greater strategic and financial flexibility, in February 2004,
we completed the acquisition of the 49.9% equity interest held by Mentmore plc
(“Mentmore”) in IME for total consideration of 82,500 British pounds sterling
($154,000) in cash. Included in this amount is the repayment of all trade and
working capital funding owed to Mentmore by IME. Completion of the transaction
gave us 100% ownership of IME. This transaction did not have material impact on
revenue or operating income since we already fully consolidated IME’s financial
results. Using the purchase method of accounting for this acquisition, the net
assets of IME were adjusted to reflect 49.9% of the difference between the fair
market value and their carrying value on the date of acquisition.

To build upon our mission
to protect our customers’ information regardless of format, in November 2004,
we acquired Connected Corporation (“Connected”) for total cash consideration of
$109,326 (net of cash acquired). Connected’s technology allows for the
protection, archiving and recovery of distributed data.

To develop our presence in
Asia Pacific, in December 2005, we acquired the Australian and New Zealand
operations of Pickfords Records Management for total cash consideration of
approximately Australian Dollar 115,000 ($86,276, net of cash acquired).

To extend our leadership
role in the protection of our customer’ business data, in December 2005,
we acquired full ownership of LiveVault Corporation (“LiveVault”) for cash
consideration of $35,798 (net of cash acquired). As of December 31, 2004,
we had a minority interest investment in LiveVault with a carrying value of
$3,615. LiveVault is a provider of disk-based online server backup and recovery
solutions.

$10,500 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively, and
customer relationship assets of $64,064, $70,724 and $37,492 for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.

Consisted primarily of
the carrying value of minority interests of Latin American partners at the date

(6)

Consisted primarily of
the carrying value of minority interests of European, Latin American and Asia
Pacific partners at the date of acquisition.

Allocation of the purchase price for the 2006
acquisitions was based on estimates of the fair value of net assets acquired,
and is subject to adjustment. The purchase price allocations of certain 2006
transactions are subject to finalization of the assessment of the fair value of
property, plant and equipment, intangible assets (primarily customer
relationship assets), operating leases, restructuring purchase reserves,
deferred revenue and deferred income taxes. We are not aware of any information
that would indicate that the final purchase price allocations will differ
meaningfully from preliminary estimates.

In connection with each of our acquisitions, we have
undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses. The restructuring
activities include certain reductions in staffing levels, elimination of
duplicate facilities and other costs associated with exiting certain activities
of the acquired businesses. The estimated cost of these restructuring activities
were recorded as costs of the acquisitions and were provided in accordance with
EITF No. 95-3, “Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a
Purchase Business Combination.” We finalize restructuring plans for each
business no later than one year from the date of acquisition. Unresolved
matters at December 31, 2006 primarily include completion of planned
abandonments of facilities and severance contracts in connection with certain
acquisitions.

The
following is a summary of reserves related to such restructuring activities:

At December 31, 2005, the restructuring reserves

($9,760), severance costs ($569) and other exit costs ($2,369). At December 31,
2006,


IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

Acquisitions (Continued)

the restructuring reserves
related to acquisitions consisted of lease losses on abandoned facilities
($3,010), severance costs ($259) and other exit costs ($2,284). These accruals
are expected to be used prior to December 31, 2007 except for lease losses
of $2,142, severance contracts of $127, and other exit costs of $463, all of
which are based on contracts that extend beyond one year.

In connection with our acquisition in India, we
entered into a shareholder agreement in May 2006. The agreement contains a
put provision that would allow the minority stockholder to sell the remaining
49.9% equity interest to us beginning on the third anniversary of this
agreement for the greater of fair market value or approximately 84,835 Rupees
(approximately $1,800). In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees
of Indebtedness of Others—An Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57
and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34,” we recorded a
liability representing our estimate of the fair value of the guarantee in the
amount of $368, with the offset to goodwill.

In connection with some of
our acquisitions, we have potential earn-out obligations that would be payable
in the event businesses we acquired meet certain operational objectives. These
payments are based on the future results of these operations and our estimate
of the maximum contingent earn-out payments we may be required to make under
all such agreements as of December 31, 2006 is approximately $6,600.

We have federal net operating loss carryforwards which
begin to expire in 2018 through 2021 of $172,700 at December 31, 2006 to
reduce future federal taxable income, if any. We also have an asset for state
net operating loss of $18,200 (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to
expire in 2007 through 2024, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately
98%. Additionally, we have federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards
of $4,800, which have no expiration date and are available to reduce future
income taxes, if any, and foreign tax credits, which expire in 2016, of
$23,600.

We are subject to examination by various tax
authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations.
We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities
and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2006, we
had approximately $62,000 of reserves related to uncertain tax positions
included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. Approximately $36,000 of the reserve is related to
pre-acquisition net operating loss carryforwards and other acquisition related
items. If the tax position is sustained, the reversal of this reserve will be
recorded as a reduction of goodwill. Although we believe our tax estimates

The majority of the
increase in our valuation allowance from 2005 to 2006 relates primarily to
previously unrecorded state net operating losses that are subject to valuation
allowance. Approximately $2,375 of the total 2006 valuation allowance, if
realized, will be recorded as a reduction to goodwill.

We receive a tax deduction upon the exercise of
non-qualified stock options or upon the disqualifying disposition by employees
of incentive stock options and shares acquired under our employee stock
purchase plan for the difference between the exercise price and the market price
of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise or disqualifying
disposition. The tax benefit for non-qualified stock options and the 15%
discount associated with our employee stock purchase plan are included in the
consolidated financial statements in the period in which compensation expense
is recorded. The tax benefit associated with compensation expense recorded in
the consolidated financial statements related to incentive stock options and
incremental amounts recorded above the 15% discount associated with the
employee stock purchase plan are recorded in the period the disqualifying
disposition occurs. All tax benefits for awards issued prior to January 1,
2003 and incremental tax benefits in excess of compensation expense recorded in
the consolidated financial statements are credited directly to equity and
amounted to $6,904, $9,668 and $4,387 for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.

7. Income
Taxes (Continued)

We have not provided deferred taxes on book basis
differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis
differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and we intend
to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose
primarily through the undistributed book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.
The basis differences could be reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the
receipt of dividends from subsidiaries as well as certain other events or
actions on our part, which would result in an increase in our provision for
income taxes.

The
provision for income taxes consists of the following components:

The South America, Mexico and Asia Pacific operating
segments do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for a reportable
segment, but have been aggregated and reported with Europe as one reportable
segment, “International Physical Business,” given their similar economic
characteristics, products, customers and processes. The Worldwide Digital
Business does not meet the quantitative criteria for a reportable segment;
however, management determined that it would disclose such information on a
voluntary basis.

9.
Segment Information (Continued)

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are
the same as those described in Note 2 except that certain corporate and
centrally controlled costs are allocated primarily to our North American
Physical Business and Worldwide Digital Business segments. These allocations,
which include human resources, information technology, finance, rent, real
estate property taxes, medical costs, incentive compensation, stock option
expense, worker’s compensation, 401(k) match contributions and property,
general liability, auto and other insurance, are based on rates and
methodologies established at the beginning of each year. Included in the
corporate costs allocated to our North American Physical Business segment are
certain costs related to staff functions, including finance, human resources
and information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. These
costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a
corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and
procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each
segment bearing its own cost of implementation. Management has decided to
allocate these costs to the North American segment as further allocation is
impracticable.

Contribution for each segment is defined as total
revenues less cost of sales (excluding depreciation) and selling, general and
administrative expenses (including the costs allocated to each segment as
described above). Internally, we use Contribution as the basis for evaluating
the performance of and allocating resources to our operating segments.

minority interest on a consolidated basis is as follows:

10. Commitments and
Contingencies

a.    Leases

Most of our leased facilities are leased under various
operating leases. A majority of these leases have renewal options of five to
ten years and may have fixed or Consumer Price Index escalation clauses. We
also lease equipment under operating leases, primarily computers which have an
average lease life of three years. Trucks and office equipment are also leased
and have remaining lease lives ranging from one to seven years. Total rent
expense under all of our operating leases was $163,564, $185,542 and $207,760
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.
Included in total rent expense was sublease income of $2,765, $3,238 and $3,740
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.

We have guaranteed the
residual value of certain vehicle operating leases to which we are a party. The
maximum net residual value guarantee obligation for these vehicles as of December 31,
2006 was $57,129. Such amount does not take into consideration the recovery or
resale value associated with these vehicles. We believe that it is not
reasonably likely that we will be required to perform under these guarantee
agreements or that any performance requirement would have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.

b.    Litigation

We are involved in
litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business with a portion
of the defense and/or settlement costs being covered by various commercial
liability insurance policies purchased by us. In the opinion of management, no
material legal proceedings are pending to which we, or any of our properties,
are subject. We record legal costs associated with loss contingencies as
expenses in the period in which they are incurred.

11. Related Party
Transactions

We lease space to an affiliated company, Schooner
Capital LLC (“Schooner”), for its corporate headquarters located in Boston,
Massachusetts. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006,
Schooner paid rent to us totaling $153, $161 and $167, respectively. We lease
facilities from an officer. Our aggregate rental payment for such facilities
during 2004, 2005 and 2006 was $955, $978 and $1,113, respectively.

We have an agreement with Leo W. Pierce, Sr., our
former Chairman Emeritus and the father of J. Peter Pierce, our former
director, that requires pension payments of $8 per month until his death. The estimated
remaining benefit is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets in the amount of $634 as of December 31, 2006.

In December 2005, IME
made a $2,860 investment in a Polish joint venture in which one of our directors
has an indirect 20% interest.

12. 401(k) Plans

We have a defined contribution plan, which generally
covers all non-union U.S. employees meeting certain service requirements.
Eligible employees may elect to defer from 1% to 25% of compensation per pay
period up to the amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, IME
operates a defined contribution plan, which is similar to the U.S.’s 401(k) Plan.
We make matching contributions based on the amount of an employee’s
contribution in accordance with the plan documents. We have expensed $4,320,
$6,737 and $9,997 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006,
respectively.

13. London Fire

In July 2006, we experienced a significant fire
in a records and information management facility in London, England that
resulted in the complete destruction of the leased facility. London fire
authorities recently issued a report in which it was concluded that the fire
resulted from a deliberate act of arson; the report also stated that the
actions of a guard employed by a third-party security service contractor
resulted in the disabling of the automatic sprinkler system in the building.

We believe we carry
adequate property and liability insurance. We do not expect that this event
will have a material impact to our consolidated results of operations or
financial condition. Revenues from this facility represent less than 1% of our
consolidated enterprise revenues. As of December 31, 2006, we have
approximately $9,600 recorded as an insurance receivable which is included in
prepaid expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet which
primarily represents the net book value of the property, plant and equipment
associated with this facility at the time of the incident, net of $1,750 of
property insurance proceeds received through IME’s October 31, 2006 fiscal
year-end. Subsequent to IME’s October 31, 2006 fiscal year-end, IME
received payment from our insurance carrier of approximately 8,600 British
pounds sterling ($16,850). We expect to utilize cash received from our
insurance carriers to fund capital expenditures and for general working capital
needs. Such amount represents a portion of our business personal property,
business interruption, and expense claims with our insurance carrier. We will record
approximately $8,833 to other (income) expense, net in the first quarter of
2007 related to recoveries associated with our business interruption portion of
our insurance claim to date. We expect to settle the remaining property portion
of our insurance claim with our insurance carriers within the next twelve
months and have, therefore, classified the remaining insurance receivable as a
current asset. We expect to receive recoveries related to our property claim
with our insurance carriers that will exceed the carrying value of such assets.
We, therefore, expect to record gains on the disposal/writedown of property,
plant and equipment, net in our statement of operations in future periods when
the cash received to date exceeds the remaining carrying value of the related
property, plant and equipment, net. Recoveries from the insurance carriers
related to business personal property claims are reflected in our statement of
cash flows under proceeds from sales of property and equipment and other, net
included in investing activities section when received. Recoveries from the
insurance carriers related to business interruption claims are reflected in our
statement of cash flows as a component of net income included in the operating
activities section when received.

14. Subsequent Events

In January 2007, we completed an offering of
225,000 Euro in aggregate principal amount of our 6


¤


% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due
2018, which were issued at a price of 98.99% of par and priced to yield 6.875%.
Our net proceeds of 219,200 Euro ($283,820),after paying the underwriters’
discounts and commissions and estimated expenses (excluding accrued interest
payable by purchasers of the notes from October 17, 2006). These net
proceeds were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the IMI term loan
and revolving credit facilities. We recorded a charge to other (income)
expense, net of $503 in the first quarter of 2007 related to the early
retirement of the IMI term loans, representing the write-off of a portion of
our deferred financing costs. In addition, in January, 2007 we entered into
forward contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for 96,000 Euros and 194,000 CAD for
127,500 Euros to hedge our intercompany exposures with Canada and our
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Euro. These forward contracts
settle on a monthly basis, at which time we enter into new forward contracts
for the same underlying amounts, to continue to hedge movements in CAD and
Euros against the U.S. dollar. At the time of settlement, we either pay or
receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract.
