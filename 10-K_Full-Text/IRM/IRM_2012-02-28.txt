DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

Certain information required in Items 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of Part III of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K is incorporated by reference from our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (our "Proxy Statement") to be filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission within 120 days after the close of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

We have made statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that constitute "forward-looking statements" as that term
is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements concern our operations, economic performance, financial
condition, goals, beliefs, future growth strategies, investment objectives, plans and current expectations, such as our (1) expected increase in our Adjusted OIBDA margins in our International
Business segment, (2) commitment to stockholder payouts and dividend payments, (3) expected target leverage ratio, and (4) expected divestiture of the Italian Business. The
forward-looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. When we use words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates" or similar
expressions, we are making forward-looking statements.

Although
we believe that our forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from our
expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, among others:

•

the cost to comply with current and future laws, regulations and customer demands relating to privacy issues;

•

the impact of litigation or disputes that may arise in connection with incidents in which we fail to protect our
customers' information;

•

changes in the price for our services relative to the cost of providing such services;

•

changes in customer preferences and demand for our services;

•

the adoption of alternative technologies and shifts by our customers to storage of data through non-paper based
technologies;

•

the cost or potential liabilities associated with real estate necessary for our business;

•

the performance of business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management expertise outside the
U.S.;

•

changes in the political and economic environments in the countries in which our international subsidiaries operate;

•

the failure to consummate a successful sale of the Italian Business;

•

claims that our technology violates the intellectual property rights of a third party;

•

the impact of legal restrictions or limitations under stock repurchase plans on price, volume or timing of stock
repurchases;

•

the impact of alternative, more attractive investments on dividends or stock repurchases;

ii


•

our ability or inability to complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms and to integrate acquired companies efficiently;
and

•

other trends in competitive or economic conditions affecting our financial condition or results of operations not
presently contemplated.

Other
risks may adversely impact us, as described more fully under "Item 1A. Risk Factors."

You
should not rely upon forward-looking statements except as statements of our present intentions and of our present expectations, which may or may not occur. You should read these
cautionary statements as being applicable to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to release publicly the result of any revision
to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Readers are also urged to carefully
review and consider the various disclosures we have made in this document, as well as our other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission" or "SEC").

PART I

Item 1. Business.

A.    Development of Business.

We provide information management services that help organizations around the world lower the costs, risks and inefficiencies of managing their physical and
digital data. Our solutions enable customers to protect and better use their information—regardless of its format, location or lifecycle stage—so they can optimize their
business and ensure proper recovery, compliance and discovery. We offer comprehensive records management services, data protection & recovery services and information destruction services,
along with the expertise and experience to address complex information management challenges such as rising storage costs, litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery. Founded in an
underground facility near Hudson, New York in 1951, Iron Mountain Incorporated, a Delaware corporation, is a trusted partner to more than 155,000 clients throughout North America, Europe, Latin
America and Asia Pacific. We have a diversified customer base comprised of commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more
than 94% of the Fortune 1000. As of December 31, 2011, we provided services in more than 35 countries on five continents, employed over 17,000 people and operated more than
975 facilities.

Now
in our 61

st

year, we have experienced tremendous growth, particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in February
1996. We have grown from a business with limited product offerings and annual revenues of $104.0 million in 1995 into a global enterprise providing a broad range of information management
services to customers in markets around the world with total revenues of more than $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. On January 5, 2009, we were added to the
S&P 500 Index and as of December 31, 2011 we were number 643 on the Fortune 1000.

Our
success since becoming a public company in 1996 has been driven in large part by our execution of a consistent long-term growth plan to build market leadership by
extending our strategic position through service line and global expansion. This growth plan has been sequenced into three phases. The first phase involved establishing leadership and broad market
access in our core businesses, records management and data protection & recovery, primarily through acquisitions. In the second phase, we invested in building a successful selling organization
to access new customers, converting previously unvended demand. While different parts of our business are in different stages of evolution along our three-phase strategy, as an enterprise, we have
transitioned to the third phase of our growth plan, which we call the capitalization phase. In this phase, which we expect to continue for many years, we seek to expand our relationships with our
customers to continue solving their increasingly complex information management problems. Growing our customer relationships well means expanding our service offerings on a global basis while
maximizing our solid core businesses. In doing this, we continue to build what we believe to be a very durable business through disciplined execution.

Consistent
with this model, we have transitioned from a growth strategy driven primarily by acquisitions of information management services companies to a growth strategy driven
primarily by internal growth. In 2001, internal revenue growth exceeded growth through acquisitions for the first time since we began the first phase of our growth plan in 1996. This has been the case
in each year since 2001, with the exception of 2004. In the absence of significant acquisition spending, we expect to achieve a majority of our revenue growth internally in 2012 and beyond.

We
expect to achieve our long-term growth goals by offering our customers integrated services that address their increasingly complex information management needs regardless
of the
format, location or lifecycle stage of their information. By offering integrated services, we aim to help our customers reduce the costs, risks and complexities associated with managing their data
while increasing their compliance with various laws, regulations, company policies and industry best practices. Consistent with



our
overall strategy, we are focused on improving our internal revenue growth trajectory in the near-term primarily through a set of specific initiatives. These initiatives are based on a
targeted approach to improving our sales effectiveness through increased focus on our core businesses, customer segmentation and enhanced marketing programs. By successfully executing on these
initiatives, we expect to increase revenues from our existing customers by selling them new services and by gaining new customers that do not currently outsource some or all of their information
management service needs or who outsource their information management needs to other vendors. We are also targeting higher growth in certain international businesses as we expand our platform for
selling core services and new services in higher growth markets. Finally, we are continuing to expand our services portfolio in the hybrid records market, which includes both physical and digital
records, to capture what we see as larger, faster growing opportunities.

At
this stage in our evolution we are also focused on driving increased profitability and cash flow through a disciplined management approach and a focus on optimizing our business
operations. Comprised of productivity initiatives, pricing program improvements and cost controls, our optimization strategy has produced significant and visible results. Between 2007 and 2011, we
have compounded annual growth rates of 8% for adjusted operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments and (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant
and equipment, net ("Adjusted OIBDA"), 15% for Adjusted Earnings per Share and 28% for Free Cash Flows before Acquisitions and Discretionary Investments ("FCF"). During that same
period, we reduced our capital expenditures (excluding real estate) as a percent of revenues from 13.5% in 2007 to 6.6% in 2011. These gains were driven primarily by the optimization of our North
American Business segment as we increased Adjusted OIBDA margins in that segment by more than 700 basis points. Our focus is on sustaining the high margin, high profitability levels of the North
American Business segment while optimizing our International Business segment using the same strategies. We expect to increase our Adjusted OIBDA margins in the International Business segment by
approximately 700 basis points between 2010 and the end of 2013. For more detailed definitions and reconciliations of Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted Earnings per Share from Continuing
Operations and FCF and a discussion of why we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors, see "Item 7. Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Measures."

We
are committed to delivering stockholder value. To that end, and supported by our increased profitability and strong cash flows, we initiated a stockholder payout program in February
2010 consisting of a share repurchase authorization of up to $150.0 million and a dividend policy under which we have paid and in the future intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock.
Our first ever quarterly cash dividend, declared in March 2010, was $0.0625 per share. Since initiating our stockholder
payout program in February 2010, our board of directors has approved increases in the amount authorized under our share repurchase program of up to an additional $1.05 billion, bringing the
total authorization to $1.2 billion. As of December 31, 2011, we have purchased 36.6 million shares of our common stock for $1.1 billion under this program. We have also
increased our quarterly dividend on two occasions, most recently to $0.25 per share in June 2011, which represents a 300% increase over the quarterly amount declared in March 2010.

In
April 2011, we announced a three-year strategic plan to increase stockholder value. The key components of our plan are: (i) sustaining a leadership position in our
North American Business segment; (ii) driving substantial improvements in our International Business segment; and (iii) committing to significant stockholder payouts of
$2.2 billion through 2013, with $1.2 billion being paid out through May 2012. As of December 31, 2011, we had returned $1.1 billion to stockholders against our commitment
of returning $1.2 billion through May 2012, including $0.1 billion in dividends and $1.0 billion in share repurchases. As part of our strategic plan, in June 2011, we completed
the sale of our online backup and recovery, digital archiving and eDiscovery solutions businesses (the "Digital Business") for approximately $395.4 million in cash. Additionally, in connection
with our strategic



portfolio
review of certain international operations, we sold our New Zealand operations in October 2011 for approximately $10.0 million in cash and, in December 2011, we committed to a plan to
sell our records management business in Italy (the "Italian Business").

B.    Description of Business.

Overview

Our information management services can be broadly divided into three major service categories: records management services, data
protection & recovery services, and information destruction services. Media formats can be broadly divided into physical and electronic records. We define physical records to include paper
documents, as well as all other non-electronic media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, X-rays and blueprints. Electronic records include
e-mail and various forms of magnetic media such as computer tapes, hard drives and optical disks.

Our
records management services include: records management program development and implementation based on best practices to help customers comply with specific regulatory requirements,
implementation of policy-based programs that feature secure, cost-effective storage for all major media, including paper (which is the dominant form of records storage), flexible retrieval
access and retention management. Included within records management services are our hybrid services. These services help organizations gain better access to, and ultimately control over, their paper
records by digitizing, indexing and hosting them in online archives to provide complete information lifecycle solutions. Within the records management services category, we have developed specialized
services for vital records and regulated industries such as healthcare, energy, government and financial services.

Our
data protection & recovery services include disaster preparedness, planning, support and secure, off-site vaulting of data backup media for fast and efficient data
recovery in the event of a disaster, human error or virus. Our technology-based data protection & recovery services include online backup and recovery solutions for desktop and laptop computers
and remote servers. Since our sale of the Digital Business, we continue to offer these technology-based services primarily through partnerships. Additionally, we serve as a trusted, neutral third
party and offer technology escrow services to protect and manage source code and other proprietary information.

Our
information destruction services are comprised almost exclusively of secure shredding services. Secure shredding services complete the lifecycle of a record and involve the shredding
of sensitive documents in a way that ensures privacy and a secure chain of custody for the records. These services typically include either the scheduled pick-up of loose office records,
which customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide, or the shredding of documents stored in records facilities upon the expiration of their scheduled retention periods.

Physical Records

Physical records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. Active records relate to ongoing and recently
completed activities or contain information that is frequently referenced. Active records are usually stored and managed on-site by their owners to ensure ready availability. Inactive
physical records are the principal focus of the information management services industry and consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be retained for legal,
regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. A large and growing specialty subset of the physical records market is medical records. These
are active and semi-active records that are often stored off-site with, and serviced by, an information management services vendor. Special regulatory requirements often apply
to medical records. In addition to our core records management services, we provide consulting, facilities management, fulfillment and other outsourcing services.



Electronic Records

Electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of
recently processed data or archival in nature. We believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they face in their physical records
management programs and consist primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access to and control over the data in a secure environment; and (3) the need
to retain electronic records due to regulatory requirements or for litigation support. Customer needs for data backup and recovery and archiving are distinctively different. Backup data exists because
of the need of many businesses to maintain backup copies of their data in order to be able to recover the data in the event of a system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. It is customary (and a
best practice) for data processing groups to rotate backup tapes to off-site locations on a regular basis and to require multiple copies of such information at multiple sites. In addition
to the physical rotation and storage of backup data that we provide, we offer online backup services through partnerships as an alternative way for businesses to store and access data. Online backup
is a Web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop and laptop computers over the Internet and stores it in secure data centers.

Growth of Market

We believe that the volume of stored physical and electronic records will continue to increase on a global basis for a number of
reasons, including: (1) regulatory requirements; (2) concerns over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of records; (3) the
continued proliferation of data processing technologies such as personal computers and networks; (4) inexpensive document producing technologies such as desktop publishing software and desktop
printing; (5) the high cost of reviewing records and deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and
(7) the need to keep backup copies of certain records in off-site locations for business continuity purposes in the event of disaster.

We
believe that the creation of paper-based information will be sustained, not in spite of, but because of, "paperless" technologies such as e-mail and the Internet. These
technologies have prompted the creation of hard copies of such electronic information and have also led to increased
demand for electronic records services, such as the storage and off-site rotation of backup copies of magnetic media. In addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital information
technologies and distributed data networks has created a growing need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality technology solutions for electronic data protection and the management of
electronic documents.

Acquisitions in a Highly Fragmented Industry

The physical information management services industry has long been and remains a highly fragmented industry with thousands of
competitors in North America and around the world. Between 1995 and 2004 there was significant acquisition activity in the industry driven primarily by us and certain of our larger competitors.
Acquisitions were a fast and efficient way to achieve scale, expand geographically and broaden service offerings.

We
believe that since the 1990s there has been ongoing acquisition activity in the physical information management services industry, both in North America and internationally, because
of the opportunities for larger information management services providers to achieve economies of scale and meet customer demands for more sophisticated, technology-based solutions. We believe that
this trend is also due to, and may continue as a result of, the preference of certain large organizations to contract with one physical information management services vendor in multiple cities and
countries for its physical information management service needs. Larger national or multinational information management service companies are better able to satisfy the demands of larger
multi-city or multi-national customers than single city competitors.



Attractive
acquisitions, many of which are small, in North America and internationally continue to exist and we may from time to time acquire these businesses where we believe they
present a good opportunity to create value for our stockholders.

Characteristics of Our Business

We generate our revenues by providing storage, core records management, data protection & recovery, information destruction,
hybrid services and an expanding menu of complementary products and services to a large and diverse customer base. Providing outsourced information management services is the mainstay of our customer
relationships and serves as the foundation for our revenue growth. Core services, which are a vital part of a comprehensive records management program, consist primarily of the handling and
transportation of stored records and information. In our secure shredding operations, core services consist primarily of the scheduled collection and shredding of records and documents generated by
business operations. Additionally, core services include certain hybrid services and recurring project revenues. As is the case with storage revenues, core service revenues are highly recurring in
nature. In 2011, our storage and core service revenues represented approximately 88% of our total consolidated revenues. In addition to our core services, we offer a wide array of complementary
products and services, including special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage
containers and related supplies). In addition, complementary services revenue includes recycled paper revenue. Complementary services address more specific needs and are designed to enhance our
customers' overall records management programs. These services complement our core services; however, they are more episodic and discretionary in nature. Revenue generated by all of our operating
segments includes both core and complementary components.

In
general, our North American Business and our International Business segments offer the products and services discussed below, in their respective geographies. The amount of revenues
derived from our North American Business and International Business segments and other relevant data, including financial information about geographic areas and product and service lines, for fiscal
years 2009, 2010 and 2011 are set forth in Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Service Offerings

Our information management services can be broadly divided into three major categories: records management services, data
protection & recovery services and information destruction services. We offer both physical services and technology solutions in the records management and data protection & recovery
categories. Currently, we only offer physical services in the information destruction services category.

Records Management Services

By far our largest category of services, records management services consists primarily of the archival storage of records for long
periods of time according to applicable laws, regulations and industry best practices. Core to any records management program is the handling and transportation of stored records and the eventual
destruction of those records upon the expiration of their scheduled retention periods. This is accomplished through our extensive service and courier operations. Other records management services
include our hybrid services as well as Compliant Records Management and Consulting Services, Health Information Management Solutions, IM Entertainment Services, Energy Data Services, Discovery
Services and other ancillary services.

Hard
copy business records are typically stored in cartons packed by the customer for long periods of time with limited activity. For some customers we store individual files on an open
shelf basis and these files are typically more active. Storage charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit



basis,
usually either per carton or per cubic foot of records, and include the provision of space, racking, computerized inventory and activity tracking and physical security.

Service
and courier operations are an integral part of our comprehensive records management program for all physical media and include adding records to storage, temporarily removing
records from storage, refiling of removed records, permanently withdrawing records from storage and destroying records. Service charges are generally assessed for each activity on a per unit basis.
Courier operations consist primarily of the pick-up and delivery of records upon customer request. Charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location and
are billed monthly. As of December 31, 2011, we were utilizing a fleet of approximately 3,700 owned or leased vehicles.

The
growth rate of mission-critical digital information is accelerating, driven in part by the use of the Internet as a distribution and transaction medium. The rising cost and
increasing importance of digital information management, coupled with the increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may create meaningful opportunities for us to provide
solutions to our customers with respect to their digital records management challenges. We continue to cultivate marketing and technology partnerships to support this anticipated growth.

The
focus of our hybrid business is to develop, implement and support comprehensive information management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers' information. We seek to
develop solutions that solve our customers' document management challenges by integrating the management of physical records, document conversion and digital storage. Our hybrid services complement
our core service offerings, leveraging our global footprint and our existing customer relationships. We differentiate our offerings from our competitors by providing solutions that integrate and
extend our existing portfolio of products and services. The trend towards increased usage of Electronic Document Management ("EDM") systems represents another opportunity for us to manage active
records. Our hybrid services provide the bridge between customers' physical documents and their new EDM solutions.

We
offer records management services that have been tailored for specific industries, such as health care, or to address the needs of customers with more specific requirements based on
the critical nature of their records. Healthcare information services principally include the handling, storage, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records used by hospitals, private
practitioners and other medical institutions. Medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide easier access to individual
files. Healthcare information services also include recurring project work and ancillary services. Recurring project work involves the on-site removal of aged patient files and related
computerized file indexing. Ancillary healthcare information services include release of information (medical record copying and delivery), temporary staffing, contract coding, facilities management
and imaging.

Vital
records contain critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film and other highly proprietary information, such as energy data. Vital records may
require special facilities or services, either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. Our charges for providing enhanced security and special climate-controlled
environments for vital records are higher than for typical storage services. We provide the same ancillary services for vital records as we provide for our other storage operations.

We
offer a variety of additional services which customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. These services include conducting records inventories, packing records into
cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. We also provide services for the management of active records programs. We can provide these services,
which generally include document and file processing and storage, both off-site at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel to perform management functions on-site
at the customer's premises. We also sell a full line of specially designed corrugated cardboard storage cartons.



Other
complementary lines of business that we operate include fulfillment services and professional consulting services. Fulfillment services are performed by our wholly owned
subsidiary, Iron Mountain
Fulfillment Services, Inc. ("IMFS"). IMFS stores marketing literature and other materials for its customers and delivers this material to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers'
locations based on current and prospective customer requests. In addition, IMFS assembles custom marketing packages and orders and manages and provides detailed reporting on customer marketing
literature inventories. A growing element of the content we manage and fulfill is stored digitally and printed on demand by IMFS. Digital print allows marketing materials such as brochures, direct
mail, flyers, pamphlets and newsletters to be personalized to the recipient with variable messages, graphics and content.

We
provide professional consulting services to customers, enabling them to develop and implement comprehensive records and information management programs. Our consulting business draws
on our experience in information management services to analyze the practices of companies and assist them in creating more effective programs of records and information management. Our consultants
work with these customers to develop policies and schedules for document retention and destruction.

We
divested ourselves of our domain name management product line in 2010 and our Digital Business, including our former wholly owned subsidiaries, Mimosa Systems, Inc. and
Stratify, Inc., and New Zealand operations in 2011. Also, we committed to selling our Italian Business in December 2011. Consistent with our treatment of acquisitions, we eliminated all
revenues associated with these businesses, which have all been reflected as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes, from the calculation of our internal growth rates for 2009, 2010
and 2011.

Data Protection & Recovery Services

Our data protection & recovery services are designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to satisfy industry best
practices with regard to the off-site vaulting of data for disaster recovery and business continuity purposes. We provide data protection & recovery services for both physical and
electronic records. We also offer technology escrow services in this category.

Physical
data protection & recovery services consist of the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery and business continuity plans.
Computer tapes, cartridges and disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where they are available to
customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to facilitate data recovery in the event of a disaster. Frequently, backup tapes are rotated from our facilities back to our customers' data
centers. We also manage tape library relocations and support disaster recovery testing and execution.

Online
backup is a Web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop or laptop computers over the Internet and stores it in
secure data
centers. Since our sale of the Digital Business, we continue to offer this service pursuant to a reseller agreement with Autonomy Corporation plc, a corporation formed under the laws of England
and Wales ("Autonomy").

Through
our technology escrow services business, we act as a trusted, neutral, third party, safeguarding valuable technology assets—such as software source code, object code
and data—in secure, access-protected escrow accounts. Acting in this intermediary role, we help document and maintain intellectual property integrity. The result is increased control and
leverage for all parties, enabling them to protect themselves, while maintaining competitive advantage.

Information Destruction Services

Our information destruction services consist primarily of physical secure shredding operations. Secure shredding is a natural extension
of our hard copy records management services, completing the lifecycle of a record, and involves the shredding of sensitive documents for customers that, in many cases, also use our services for
management of archival records. These services typically include the



scheduled
pick-up of loose office records which customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide. Complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the
resultant waste paper to third-party recyclers. Through a combination of plant-based shredding operations and mobile shredding units comprised of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure
shredding services to our customers throughout the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and Latin America.

Financial Characteristics of Our Business

Our financial model is based on the recurring nature of our various revenue streams. The historical predictability of our revenues and
the resulting Adjusted OIBDA allow us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. Our business has the following financial characteristics:

•

Recurring Revenues.

We derive a majority of our
consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, fees charged to customers based on the volume of records stored. Once a customer places physical records in storage with us and until those
records are destroyed or permanently removed (for which we typically receive a service fee), we receive recurring payments for storage fees without incurring additional labor or marketing expenses or
significant capital costs. Similarly, contracts for the storage of electronic backup media involve primarily fixed monthly payments. Our annual revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have
grown for 23 consecutive years. For each of the three years 2009 through 2011, storage revenues, which are stable and recurring, have accounted for over 55% or more of our total
consolidated revenues. This stable and growing storage revenue base also provides the foundation for increases in service revenues and Adjusted OIBDA.

•

Historically Non-Cyclical Storage
Business.

Historically, we have not experienced significant reductions in our storage business as a result of economic downturns
although, during recent economic slowdowns, the rate at which some customers added new cartons to their inventory was below historical levels. We believe that companies that have outsourced records
management services are less likely during economic downturns to incur the move-out costs and other expenses associated with accelerating destruction of their records, switching vendors or
moving their records management services programs in-house. However, during the current economic downturn, which is more severe and has lasted longer than other recent downturns,
destruction rates have increased as some customers have been more willing to incur additional short-term service costs in exchange for lower storage costs in the long-term. In
addition, we have experienced longer sales cycles and lower incoming volumes from existing customers, due in large part we believe to high unemployment rates and generally lower levels of business
activity. Combined, these impacts have resulted in lower net volume growth rates. The net effect of these factors has been the continued growth of our storage revenue base, albeit at a lower rate. For
each of the three years 2009 through 2011, total net volume storage growth has been approximately 2% on a global basis.

•

Inherent Growth from Existing Physical Records
Customers.

Our physical records customers have, on average, sent us additional cartons at a faster rate than stored cartons have been
destroyed or permanently removed. However, during the current economic downturn, the combination of lower incoming volumes from existing customers, due in large part we believe to high unemployment
rates and generally lower business activity, and increased destruction rates, as described above, has resulted in net volume growth from existing customers being negative at times in certain markets.
We expect that after the economy has improved, our growth from existing customers will improve although we cannot give any assurance as to how much, if any, improvement we will realize. We believe the
continued growth of our physical records storage revenues is the result of a number of factors, including: (1) the trend toward increased records retention; (2) customer satisfaction
with our services; (3) the costs and inconvenience of moving storage operations in-house or to another provider of information management services; and



(4) our
positive pricing actions; however, in the current economic downturn, elevated destruction and withdrawal rates have resulted in lower net volume growth in recent quarters.

•

Diversified and Stable Customer Base.

As of
December 31, 2011, we had over 155,000 clients in a variety of industries. We currently provide services to commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and
government organizations, including more than 94% of the Fortune 1000. No customer accounted for as much as 2% of our consolidated revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2009,
2010 and 2011. For each of the three years 2009 through 2011, the average volume reduction due to customers terminating their relationship with us was less than 3%.

•

Capital Expenditures Related Primarily to Business Line Growth and Ongoing
Operations.

Our business requires significant capital expenditures to support our expected revenue growth and ongoing operations as well
as new products and services and increased profitability. As the nature of our business has evolved over time, so has the nature of our capital expenditures. Every year we expend capital to support a
number of different objectives. The majority of our capital goes to support business line growth and our ongoing operations. We also expend capital to support the development and improvement of
products and services and projects designed to increase our profitability. These expenditures are generally smaller and more discretionary in nature. Below are descriptions of the major types of
capital expenditures we are likely to make in a given year:

•

Capital to support business line growth

—these expenditures are
primarily related to capacity expansion such as investments in new building outfitting, carton storage systems, tape storage systems and containers, shredding plants and bins and technology service
storage and processing capacity.

•

Capital to support ongoing business operations

—these
expenditures are primarily related to major repairs and/or the replacement of assets, such as facilities, warehouse equipment and computers, previously referred to as maintenance capital expenditures.
This category also includes operational support initiatives such as sales and marketing and information technology projects to support infrastructure requirements.

•

Capital for new product development

—these expenditures are
directly related to the development of new products or services in support of our integrated value proposition.

•

Capital for product improvement

—these expenditures are
primarily related to product and service enhancements that support our leadership position in the various markets in which we operate. Spending in this area includes items such as increased feature
functionality, security upgrades or system enhancements.

•

Capital to support operational efficiencies

—these expenditures
are primarily related to driving increased profitability through cost savings and operating efficiencies and include items such as facility consolidations and systems to support operating process
improvements.

•

Capital to acquire/construct real estate

—these expenditures
are directly related to the acquisition of real estate, either through the purchase of a new facility or the exercise of a purchase option in an existing lease, or the construction of a
new facility.

We
believe that capital expenditures incurred as a percent of revenues is a meaningful metric for investors as it indicates the efficiency with which we are investing in the growth and
operational efficiency of our business. For the years 2009 through 2011, our total capital expenditures incurred as a percent of revenues were approximately 11%, 8% and 7%, respectively. The decrease
in capital expenditures as percent of revenues since 2009 is due primarily to our disciplined approach to capital management, a shift toward less capital intense service revenues and moderating growth
rates in our physical storage business.

Growth Strategy

We offer our customers an integrated value proposition by providing them with comprehensive records management services, data
protection & recovery services and information destruction services, along with the expertise and experience to address complex information management challenges such as rising storage costs,
litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery. We expect to maintain a leadership position in the information management services industry around the world by enabling customers to protect
and better use their information—regardless of its format, location or lifecycle stage—so they can optimize their business and ensure proper recovery, compliance
and discovery.



In
the U.S. and Canada, we seek to be one of the largest information management services providers in each of our markets. Internationally, our objectives are to continue to capitalize
on our expertise in the information management services industry and to make additional acquisitions and investments in selected international markets. Our near-term growth objectives are
comprised of a set of specific initiatives including: (1) increasing our focus on our core businesses with a targeted, low risk approach to improving our sales effectiveness and thereby
increasing revenues with our existing customers by selling them new services and gaining net new customers; (2) higher growth in our international businesses as we expand our platform for
selling core services and new services in higher growth markets; and (3) continuing to expand our services portfolio in the hybrid market to capture those larger, faster growing opportunities.
Although the focus will be on growing our business organically, targeted acquisitions will continue to play a role in our overall growth strategy.

Introduction of New Products and Services

We continue to expand our portfolio of products and services. Adding new products and services allows us to further penetrate our
existing customer accounts and attract new customers in previously untapped markets.

Growth from Existing Customers

Our existing customers' storage of physical records contributes to the growth of storage and storage-related services revenues because,
on average, our existing customers generate additional cartons at a faster rate than old cartons are destroyed or permanently removed. However, during the current economic downturn, the combination of
lower incoming volumes from existing customers, due in large part we believe to high unemployment rates and generally lower business activity, and increased destruction rates, as described above, has
resulted in net volume growth from existing customers being negative at times in certain markets. We expect that after the economy has improved, our growth from existing customers will improve
although we cannot give any assurance as to how much, if any, improvement we will realize. In order to maximize growth opportunities from existing customers, we seek to maintain high levels of
customer retention by providing premium customer service through our local account management staff.

Our
sales coverage model is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by allocating our sales resources based on a sophisticated segmentation of our
customer base and selling additional records management, data protection & recovery and information destruction services in new and existing markets within our existing customer relationships.
We also seek to leverage existing business relationships with our customers by selling complementary services and products such as special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment
services, consulting services, technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies).

Addition of New Customers

Our sales forces are dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer account relationships;
(2) generating additional revenue from existing customers in new and existing markets; and (3) expanding new and existing customer relationships by effectively selling a wide array of
complementary services and products. In order to accomplish these objectives, our sales forces draw on our U.S. and international marketing organizations and senior management.

Growth through Acquisitions

The goal of our current acquisition program is to supplement internal growth by continuing to expand our presence in targeted
international markets, continuing to make fold-in acquisitions in North America and expanding our new service capabilities and industry-specific services. We have a successful record of
acquiring and integrating information management services companies.



Acquisitions in the North American Business Segment

Although we substantially completed our geographic expansion in North America in 2003, we have since acquired and we continue to seek
to acquire information management services businesses in the U.S. and Canada. Given the relatively smaller size of the acquisition targets
in our core physical businesses in North America and our increased revenue base, future acquisitions are expected to be less significant to our overall North American Business segment revenue growth
than in the past.

Acquisitions in the International Business Segment

We substantially completed our geographic expansion in Europe and Latin America by 2003 and entered the Asia Pacific market in 2005. We
expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments in information management services businesses in targeted markets outside North America. We have acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire
and invest in, information management services companies in certain countries, and, more specifically, certain markets within such countries, where we believe there is potential for significant
growth. Future acquisitions and investments will focus primarily on expanding priority markets in Continental Europe, Latin America and Asia, with continued leverage of our successful joint venture
model.

The
experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important in our international expansion and acquisition strategy. Since beginning our international expansion
program in January 1999, we have, directly and through joint ventures, expanded our operations into more than 35 countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. These transactions have taken, and
may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of an entire business or controlling or minority investments with a long-term goal of full ownership. We believe our joint venture strategy,
rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets, better position us to expand the existing business. The local partners benefit from our expertise in the information management services
industry, our multinational customer relationships, our access to capital and our technology, and we benefit from our local partners' knowledge of the market, relationships with local customers and
their presence in the community. In addition to the criteria we use to evaluate North American acquisition candidates, when looking at an international investment or acquisition, we also evaluate the
presence in the potential market of our existing customers as well as the risks uniquely associated with an international investment, including those risks described below.

Our
long-term goal is to acquire full ownership of each business in which we made a joint venture investment. Since 2008, we acquired the remaining minority equity ownership
in our Greek (2010), Chinese (2010), Hong Kong (2010) and Singapore (2010) operations. In 2010, to better align our operations with our long-term international growth objectives, we sold
our ownership stakes in Indonesia and Sri Lanka. We now own more than 97% of our international operations, measured as a percentage of consolidated revenues. In connection with the
strategic review of certain of our international businesses, we sold our New Zealand operations in October 2011. Additionally, in December 2011, we committed to a plan to sell our Italian Business.

Our
international investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as
fluctuations in currency
valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors.

The
amount of our revenues derived from international operations and other relevant financial data for fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011 are set forth in Note 9 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, we derived approximately 31%, 32% and 34%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside of
the U.S. As of December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, we had long-lived assets of approximately 34%, 36% and 36%, respectively, outside of the U.S.



Competition

We are the global leader in the physical information management services industry with operations in more than 35 countries. We compete
with our current and potential customers' internal information management services capabilities. We can provide no assurance that these organizations will begin or continue to use an outside company
such as Iron Mountain for their future information management services.

We
also compete with numerous information management services providers in all geographic areas where we operate. The physical information management services industry is highly
competitive and includes thousands of competitors in North America and around the world. We believe that the majority of physical information management services companies serve a single city and are
either owner-operated or ancillary to another business, such as a moving and storage company. We believe that competition for customers is based on price, reputation for reliability, quality of
service and scope and scale of technology and that we generally compete effectively in each of these areas.

Alternative Technologies

We derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage-related services. This storage requires significant
physical space. Alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents. These technologies include computer media, microform, CD-ROM
and optical disk. To date, none of these technologies has replaced paper documents as the principal means for storing information. However, we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue
to store most of their records as paper documents. We continue to provide additional services such as online backup, primarily through partnerships, designed to address our customers' need for
efficient, cost-effective, high quality solutions for electronic records and information management.

Employees

As of December 31, 2011, we employed over 8,800 employees in the U.S. and over 8,200 employees outside of the U.S.
At December 31, 2011, an aggregate of 469 employees were represented by unions in California, Georgia and three provinces in Canada.

All
non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability,
retirement/401(k) and accidental death and dismemberment plans. Unionized employees receive these types of benefits through their unions. In addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, all
full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits, collections or attainment of specified objectives
for the unit in which they work. Management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and unions. All union employees are currently under renewed labor agreements or operating under
an extension agreement.

Insurance

For strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and
that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. Property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage),
subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. Property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income
loss and extra expense. Other types of
insurance that we carry, which are also subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles, include: medical, workers' compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional,
warehouse legal liability and directors' and officers' liability policies. In 2002, we established a wholly owned Vermont domiciled



captive
insurance company as a subsidiary through which we retain and reinsure a portion of our property loss exposure.

Our
customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records stored with us. Our liability under these contracts
is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. We cannot assure you that where we have limitation of liability provisions that they will be enforceable
in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability. Also, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or
contain higher limits. In addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms,
including storage and service pricing and service delivery terms. Our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. While we have had relatively few disputes with
our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, we can give you no assurance that we will not have material disputes in
the future.

Environmental Matters

Some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other
purposes that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. In some instances these properties included the operation of
underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. Although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our
former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. We therefore may be liable for environmental costs and may be unable to
sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be liable for environmental compliance and remediation
costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the
contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. Environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the
future. In addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today.

We
transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers
all owned and leased locations. Coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Our businesses face many risks. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our businesses,
financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. Our investors and prospective investors should consider the following
risks and the information contained under the heading "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" before deciding to invest in our securities.

Operational Risks

Governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. We may not be able to fully offset these costs through
increases in our rates. In addition, incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information against security breaches could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage
our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations.

In reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, almost all
states have adopted breach of data security statutes or regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information, such as social security numbers, is breached.
In addition, certain federal laws and regulations affecting financial institutions, health care providers and plans and others impose requirements regarding the privacy and security of information
maintained by those institutions as well as notification to persons whose personal information is accessed by an unauthorized third party. Some of these laws and regulations provide for civil fines in
certain circumstances. One state has adopted regulations requiring every company that maintains or stores personal information to adopt a comprehensive written information security program. In some
instances European data protection authorities have issued large fines as a result of data security breaches.

Continued
governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action. For example, the U.S. Congress is considering legislation that would expand the federal
data breach notification requirement beyond the financial and medical fields. In addition, the European Commission has proposed a new regulation and directive that will, if adopted, supersede
Directive 95/46/EC, which has governed the processing of personal data since 1995. It is anticipated that the new proposal will significantly alter the security and privacy obligations of
entities, such as Iron Mountain, that process data of citizens of members of the European Union. The continued emphasis on information security may lead customers to request that we take additional
measures to enhance security and assume higher liability under our contracts. We have experienced incidents in which customers' backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we have been informed
by customers that some of the incidents involved the loss of personal information, resulting in monetary damages which we have paid. As a result of legislative initiatives and client demands, we may
have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. Any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the
rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset any increased expenses.

In
addition to increases in the costs of operations or potential liability that may result from a heightened focus on data security, our reputation may be damaged by any compromise of
security, accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession. We believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers. If our
reputation is damaged, we
may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.



Our customers may shift from paper storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space.

We derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage related services. This storage requires significant
physical space, which we provide through our owned and leased facilities. Alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents. These
technologies include computer media, microform, CD-ROM and optical disk. U.S. federal government initiatives have resulted in many health care providers adopting programs to evolve
to greater use of electronic medical records. In addition, as alternative technologies are adopted, storage related services may decline as the physical records we store become less active and more
archived. We can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records in paper documents format. The adoption of alternative technologies may also result in decreased
demand for services related to the paper documents we store. A significant shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper based technologies, whether now existing or
developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses.

Our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in interpretation.

Our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records
or information stored with us. Our liability under physical storage contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. Our
liability under our hybrid services and other service contracts is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract. We cannot assure you that where we have limitation of liability
provisions they will be enforceable in all instances or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. In addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage and
service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage and service pricing and service delivery terms. Our customers may dispute the
interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. While we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date
have not been material, we can give you no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future.

We face competition for customers.

We compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal information management services
capabilities. These organizations may not begin or continue to use a third party, such as Iron Mountain, for their future information management services needs. We also compete with multiple
information management services providers in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us.

Our customers may be constrained in their ability to pay for services or require fewer services.

Continued economic weakness in the markets where we operate may cause some customers to postpone projects for which they would
otherwise retain our services and may, in some instances, cause customers to reduce or forgo our services. Many of our largest customers are financial institutions that have been particularly affected
by the economic downturn; their condition may lead them to reduce their use of our services. In addition, customers may increasingly seek protection under bankruptcy laws, potentially affecting not
only future business but also our ability to collect accounts receivable.



Failure to comply with certain regulatory and contractual requirements under our U.S. Government General Services Administration Multiple Award
Schedule contracts could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial position.

Selling our services to the U.S. Government subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. Failure to comply with
these requirements could subject us to investigations, price reductions, up to treble damages, and civil penalties. Noncompliance with certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result
in us being suspended or barred from future U.S. Government contracting. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and financial position.

We may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our business.

Because our business is heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. Such
risks include:

•

variable occupancy costs and difficulty locating suitable sites due to fluctuations in real estate markets;

•

uninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a
cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities;

•

inability to use our real estate holdings effectively and costs associated with vacating or consolidating facilities if
the demand for physical storage were to diminish because our customers choose other storage technologies; and

•

liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased
by us, whether or not (i) we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or (ii) the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property.

Some
of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation
and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. In some instances this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of
asbestos-containing materials. Although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not
undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. We therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell,
rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. Environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. In addition,
future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today.

International operations may pose unique risks.

As of December 31, 2011, we provided services in more than 35 countries outside the U.S. As part of our growth
strategy, we expect to continue to acquire or invest in information management services businesses in select foreign markets. International operations are subject to numerous risks,
including:

•

the impact of foreign government regulations and U.S. regulations that apply to us wherever we operate;

•

the volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate;

•

political uncertainties;



•

unforeseen liabilities, particularly within acquired businesses;

•

the risk that the business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise
outside of the U.S. will not perform as expected;

•

differences in business practices; and

•

foreign currency fluctuations.

In
particular, our net income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies associated with certain intercompany balances of our foreign subsidiaries owed to us and between
our foreign subsidiaries.

We may be subject to claims that our technology violates the intellectual property rights of a third party.

Third parties may have legal rights (including ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights) to ideas, materials,
processes, names or original works that are the same or similar to those we use. Third parties may bring claims, or threaten to bring claims, against us that allege that their intellectual property
rights are being infringed or violated by our use of intellectual property. Litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior management from operating our business. Further,
if we cannot establish our right or obtain the right to use the intellectual property on reasonable terms, we may be required to develop alternative intellectual property at our expense to mitigate
potential harm.

Changing fire and safety standards may result in significant expense in certain jurisdictions.

As of December 31, 2011, we operated 932 records management and off-site data protection facilities worldwide,
including 615 in the United States alone. Many of these facilities were built and outfitted by third parties and added to Iron Mountain's real estate portfolio as part of acquisitions. Some of these
facilities contain fire suppression and safety features that are different from our current specifications and current standards for new facilities, although we believe all of our facilities were
constructed in compliance with laws and regulations in effect at the time of their construction or outfitting. Where we believe the fire suppression and safety features of a facility require
improvement, we will develop and implement a plan to remediate the issue. In some instances local authorities having jurisdiction may take the position that our fire suppression and safety features in
a particular facility are insufficient and require additional measures which may involve considerable expense to Iron Mountain. If additional fire safety and suppression measures were required at a
large number of our facilities, this could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and results of operations.

Our operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. Our secure shredding
operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper to recyclers. We generate additional revenue when the price of diesel fuel rises above certain predetermined rates through a customer
surcharge. As a result, significant declines in paper and diesel fuel prices may negatively impact our revenues and results of operations while increases in other commodity prices, including steel,
may negatively impact our results of operations.

Unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations.

Unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, war or
terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our results of operations. These events could result in customer service
disruption, physical damages to one or more key operating facilities, the



temporary
closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems.

Attacks on our internal information technology systems could damage our reputation, harm our businesses and adversely impact our results
of operations.

Our reputation for providing secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. We have previously
faced attempts by hackers and similar unauthorized users to gain access to our information technology systems and expect to continue to face such attempts. Although we seek to prevent, detect and
investigate these security incidents and have taken steps to prevent such security breaches, there can be no assurance that attacks by unauthorized users will not be attempted in the future or that
our security measures will be effective. A successful breach of the security of our information technology systems could lead to theft or misuse of our customers' proprietary or confidential
information and result in third party claims against us and
reputational harm. If our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.

Risks Relating to our Strategic Review

No guaranty that any of the alternative financing, capital, and tax strategies being evaluated, including a potential conversion to a REIT, will be
implemented or will be successful if implemented.

In April 2011 we entered into a settlement agreement with Elliott Associates, L.P. and Elliott International, L.P. in
which we agreed to form a special committee of our board of directors to, among other things, evaluate ways to maximize stockholder value through alternative financing, capital, and tax
strategies (the "Strategic Review"), including evaluating a potential conversion to a real estate investment trust (a "REIT"). The Strategic Review has required, and may continue to require,
the expenditure of significant time and resources by us. The Strategic Review process is complex and may divert management's time and attention. We may not pursue any of the alternative strategies
being evaluated, including a potential conversion to a REIT, and we can provide no assurances that any strategy we pursue will be successfully implemented or achieve the intended benefits. Finally,
stockholder litigation that may arise in connection with the Strategic Review may result in significant costs for defense or liability. These consequences, alone or in combination, may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Risks Relating to Our Common Stock

No Guaranty of Dividend Payments or Stock Repurchases.

Our board of directors approved a share repurchase program and adopted a dividend policy under which we intend to pay quarterly cash
dividends on our common stock. In addition, on April 19, 2011, we announced our intention to make stockholder payouts of approximately $2.2 billion through 2013, with approximately
$1.2 billion of capital returned to stockholders by May 2012
through a combination of share repurchases, ongoing quarterly dividends and potential one-time dividends. Although we are committed to returning capital to stockholders and returned
$1.15 billion between April 19, 2011 and February 10, 2012, any determinations by us to repurchase our common stock or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future, as
well as the form and mix of such stockholder payouts, will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements and strategy, the price of our common stock (in
the case of the repurchase program) and our board of directors' continuing determination that the repurchase program and the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy are in the best
interests of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs. The terms of our credit agreement



and
our indentures contain provisions permitting the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases subject to certain limitations.

Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt
instruments.

We have a significant amount of indebtedness. The following table shows important credit statistics as of December 31, 2011
(dollars in millions):

Total long-term debt

$

3,353.6

Total equity

$

1,254.3

Debt to equity ratio

2.67

X

Our
substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you. Our indebtedness may increase as we continue to borrow under existing and future credit arrangements in order to
finance future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes, which would increase the associated risks. These risks include:

•

inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments;

•

inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions;

•

inability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements,
including possible required repurchases of our various indebtedness, the payment of quarterly dividends or the repurchase of shares of our common stock;

•

limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information management services
industry;

•

limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our
indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs;

•

inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; and

•

restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms.

Restrictive loan covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy.

Our credit facility and our indentures contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other
things:

•

incur additional indebtedness;

•

pay dividends or make other restricted payments;

•

make asset dispositions;

•

create or permit liens; and

•

make capital expenditures and other investments.

These
restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies.



We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness upon a change of
control event as required by our indentures.

Upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior subordinated
indebtedness. However, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes or that restrictions in our revolving
credit facility will not allow such repurchases. In addition, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not
constitute a "change of control" under our indentures.

Since Iron Mountain is a holding company, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations depends in part on the operations of our
subsidiaries.

Iron Mountain is a holding company, and substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our subsidiaries and substantially all
of our operations are conducted by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of
sufficient funds from our subsidiaries. However, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by most, but not all, of our direct and indirect
wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries.

Acquisition and Expansion Risks

Failure to manage our growth may impact operating results.

If we succeed in expanding our existing businesses, or in moving into new areas of business, that expansion may place increased demands
on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources. If not managed effectively, these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to
existing customers. In addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support future operations. Consequently, in order to manage growth effectively, we may be required
to increase expenditures to increase our physical resources, expand, train and manage our employee base, improve management, financial and information systems and controls, or make other capital
expenditures. Our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues
presented by future growth.

Failure to successfully integrate acquired operations could negatively impact our future results of operations.

The success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company. The process of integrating acquired
businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. We can give no assurance that we will
ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business. The failure to successfully integrate the cultures, operating systems, procedures and information
technologies of an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We may be unable to continue our international expansion.

Our growth strategy involves expanding operations in international markets, and we expect to continue this expansion. Europe, Latin
America and Australia have been our primary areas of focus for international expansion, and we have expanded into the Asia Pacific region to a lesser extent. We have entered into joint ventures and
have acquired all or a majority of the equity in information management services businesses operating in these areas and may acquire other information management services businesses in
the future.



This
growth strategy involves risks. We may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future at the desired pace or at all. For example, we may be
unable to:

•

identify suitable companies to acquire or invest in;

•

complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms;

•

successfully expand our infrastructure and sales force to support growth;

•

incur additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay the purchase price out of working
capital, common stock or other equity securities; or

•

enter into successful business arrangements for technical assistance or management expertise outside of the U.S.

We
also compete with other information management services providers for companies to acquire. Some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources. If any such
competitor were to devote additional resources to pursue such acquisition candidates or focus its strategy on our international markets, the purchase price for potential acquisitions or investments
could rise, competition in international markets could increase and our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2. Properties.

As of December 31, 2011, we conducted operations through 746 leased facilities and 236 facilities that we own. Our
facilities are divided among our reportable segments as follows: North American Business (643), International Business (338), and Corporate (1). These facilities contain a total
of 63.7 million square feet of space. Facility rent expense was $216.1 million and $219.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011,
respectively. The leased facilities typically have initial lease terms of five to ten years with one or more five-year options to extend. In addition, some of the leases contain either a
purchase option or a right of first refusal upon the sale of the property. Our facilities are located throughout North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, with the largest
number of facilities in California, Florida, New York, New Jersey, Texas, Canada and the United Kingdom. We believe that the space available in our facilities is adequate to meet
our current needs, although future growth may require that we acquire additional real property either by leasing or purchasing. See Note 10 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
information regarding our minimum annual lease commitments.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

In August 2010, we were named as a defendant in a patent infringement suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas by Oasis Research, LLC. The plaintiff alleges that the technology found in our Connected and LiveVault products infringed certain U.S. patents owned by the
plaintiff and seeks an unspecified amount of damages. A final pre-trial conference has been scheduled for October 12, 2012. We expect the court to establish a trial date during the
pre-trial conference. As part of the sale of our Digital Business discussed at Note 14 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, our Connected and LiveVault products were sold
to Autonomy and Autonomy has assumed this obligation and the defense of this litigation and has agreed to indemnify us against any losses.

In
July 2006, we experienced a significant fire in a leased records and information management facility in London, England, that resulted in the complete destruction of the facility and
its contents.



The
London Fire Brigade ("LFB") issued a report in which it concluded that the fire resulted either from human agency, i.e., arson, or an unidentified ignition device or source, and its
report to the Home Office concluded that the fire resulted from a deliberate act. The LFB also concluded that the installed sprinkler system failed to control the fire because the primary electric
fire pump was disabled prior to the fire and the standby diesel fire pump was disabled in the early stages of the fire by third-party contractors. We have received notices of claims from customers or
their subrogated insurance carriers under various theories of liability arising out of lost data and/or records as a result of the fire. Certain of those claims have resulted in litigation in courts
in the United Kingdom. We deny any liability in respect of the London fire, and we have referred these claims to our excess warehouse legal liability insurer, which has been defending them to date
under a reservation of rights. Certain of the claims have been settled for nominal amounts, typically one to two British pounds sterling per carton, as specified in the contracts, which amounts have
been or will be reimbursed to us from our primary property insurer. We believe we carry adequate property and liability insurance related to this incident.

General

In addition to the matters discussed above, we are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business.
A portion of the defense and/or settlement costs associated with such litigation is covered by various commercial liability insurance policies purchased by us and, in limited cases,
indemnification from third parties. In the opinion of management, other than discussed above, no material legal proceedings are pending to which we, or any of our properties, are subject.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.

None.

that there are more than 50,500 beneficial owners of our common stock.

In
February 2010, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Declaration and payment of future quarterly
dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors. In 2010 and 2011, our board of directors declared the following dividends:

Our
board of directors has authorized up to $1.2 billion in repurchases of our common stock. As of February 10, 2012, we have repurchased approximately $1.1 billion
of our common stock under such authorization. Any determinations by us to repurchase our common stock or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial
condition, results of operations, business requirements, the price of our common stock (in the case of the repurchase program) and our board of directors' continuing determination that the repurchase
program and the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy are in the best interests of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and
dividend programs. The terms of our credit agreement and our indentures contain provisions permitting the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases subject to certain limitations.

Revenue
and Adjusted OIBDA for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 have been restated to reflect a reduction in revenues of
$2,183, $3,597, $4,813 and $6,023, respectively, to correct billing errors made in connection with a government contract as more fully described in Notes 2.y. and 10.h. to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact to income from continuing operations and net income is a reduction of $1,328, $2,188, $2,927 and $3,686, respectively, for the after tax impact of the
revenue errors for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.

Prior
to January 1, 2010, the financial position and results of operations of the operating subsidiaries of Iron Mountain Europe (Group) Limited
(collectively referred to as "IME"), our European business, were consolidated based on IME's fiscal year ended October 31. Effective January 1, 2010, we changed the fiscal
year-end (and the reporting period for consolidation purposes) of IME to coincide with Iron Mountain Incorporated's fiscal year-end of December 31. We believe that the
change in accounting principle related to the elimination of the two-month reporting lag for IME is preferable because it will result in more contemporaneous reporting of events and
results related to IME. In accordance with applicable accounting literature, a change in subsidiary year-end is treated as a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective
application. The impact of the change was not material to the results of operations for the previously reported annual and interim periods after January 1, 2007, and, thus, those results have
not been revised. There is, however, a charge of $4.7 million recorded to other (income) expense, net in the year ended December 31, 2010 to recognize the immaterial difference arising
from the change. There were no significant infrequent or unusual items in the IME two-month period ended December 31, 2008 and 2009.

For
the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $85,909 related to our technology escrow
services business, which we continue to own and operate



and
which was previously reflected in the former worldwide digital business segment and is now reflected as a component of the North American Business segment. For the year ended December 31,
2010, we recorded a $197,876 non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to our former worldwide digital business that is included in loss from discontinued operations, net of tax. For the
year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $46,500 in our Western Europe reporting unit, which is a component of the International Business
segment. See Note 2.g. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
February 2010, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we began paying quarterly dividends on our common stock. See "Item 5.

Adjusted
OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments and (gain) loss on disposal/write-down
of property, plant and equipment, net. Adjusted OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. For a more detailed definition and reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA and a
discussion of why we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Measures."

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" and the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing.

This
discussion contains "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other federal securities laws. See
"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" on page ii of this filing and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" beginning on page 15 of this filing.

Overview

In August 2010, we divested the domain name management product line (the "Domain Name Product Line") of our digital business. On
June 2, 2011, we completed the sale (the "Digital Sale") of our online backup and recovery, digital archiving and eDiscovery solutions businesses (the "Digital Business") to Autonomy, pursuant
to a purchase and sale agreement dated as of May 15, 2011 among Iron Mountain Incorporated ("IMI"), certain subsidiaries of IMI and Autonomy (the "Digital Sale Agreement"). In the Digital Sale,
Autonomy purchased (i) the shares of certain of IMI's subsidiaries through which IMI conducted the Digital Business and (ii) certain assets of IMI and its subsidiaries relating to our
Digital Business. The financial position, operating results and cash flows of the Domain Name Product Line and the Digital Business, for all periods presented in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, including the gains on the sales, have been reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. IMI retained its technology escrow services business
which had previously been reported in the former worldwide digital business segment along with the Digital Business and the Domain Name Product Line. The technology escrow services business is now
reported in the North American Business segment. Additionally, on October 3, 2011, we sold our records management business in New Zealand (the "New Zealand Business"). The financial position,
operating results and cash flows of the New Zealand Business, including the gain on the sale, for all periods presented, have been reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes.
Also, in December 2011, we committed to a plan to sell the Italian Business. The financial position,
operating results and cash flows of the Italian Business, for all periods presented, have been reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. See Note 14 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.



Consolidated statements of operations amounts for 2009 and 2010 were restated in connection with the government contract billing error more fully discussed in
Notes 2.y. and 10.h. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, 2009 and 2010 consolidated statements of operations amounts related to: (a) storage, (b) service,
(c) total revenues, (d) operating income, (e) income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes, (f) provision for income taxes, (g) income from
continuing operations, (h) net income (loss) and (g) net income (loss) attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated have been changed throughout management's discussion and analysis to
conform to the restated figures.

Our
revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service revenues. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information management services industry,
consist primarily of recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis) that are typically retained by customers for many years and have accounted
for over 55% of total consolidated revenues in each of the last three years. Our annual revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 23 consecutive years. Service revenues are
comprised of charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services. Included in core service revenues are: (1) the handling of records, including
the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records and the destruction of records; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup
and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring services, including hybrid services and recurring project revenues.
Our complementary services revenues include special project work, customer termination and permanent withdrawal fees, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology
services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). A by-product of our secure shredding and destruction services is the
sale of recycled paper (included in complementary services revenues), the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility and reducing the predictability of that revenue
stream. Our consolidated revenues are also subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenue derived from outside the U.S. For the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, we derived approximately 31%, 32% and 34%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside the U.S.

We
recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided, and customers are generally
billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts for customers where storage fees or services are billed in
advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Revenue from the sales of products, which is
included as a component of service revenues, is recognized when products are shipped to the customer and title has passed to the customer. Revenues from the sales of products have historically
not been significant.

Cost
of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities),
transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most
significant. Trends in total wages and benefits in dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive
compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation. Trends in facility occupancy costs are impacted by the total number of
facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these
properties.



The
expansion of our European and secure shredding businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components. Our European operations are more labor intensive than our North American
businesses and, therefore, add incremental labor costs at a higher percentage of segment revenue than our North American business. Our secure shredding operations incur lower facility costs and higher
transportation costs as a percentage of revenues compared to our core physical businesses.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing
personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wage and benefit dollars as
a percentage of total
consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with
medical insurance. The overhead structure of our expanding European and Asian operations, as compared to our North American operations, is more labor intensive and has not achieved the same level of
overhead leverage, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European and Asian operations become a more
meaningful percentage of our consolidated results.

Our
depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital-intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which
include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationship acquisition costs and is impacted
by the nature and timing of acquisitions.

In
September 2011, as a result of certain changes we made in the manner in which our European operations are managed, we reorganized our reporting structure and reassigned goodwill among
the revised reporting units. As a result of the management and reporting changes, we concluded that we have three reporting units for our European operations: (1) the United Kingdom, Ireland
and Norway ("UKI"); (2) Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain ("Western Europe"); and (3) the remaining countries in Europe ("Central Europe"). Due to these
changes, we will perform all future goodwill impairment analysis on the new reporting unit basis. As a result of the restructuring of our reporting units, we concluded that we had an interim
triggering event, and, therefore, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe in the third quarter of 2011 as of August 31, 2011. As required by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), prior to our goodwill impairment analysis, we performed an impairment assessment on the long-lived assets
within our UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe reporting units and noted no impairment, except for the Italian Business, which was included in our Western Europe reporting unit, and which is now
included in discontinued operations. See Note 14 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on our analyses, we concluded that the goodwill of our UKI and Central Europe reporting
units was not impaired. Our UKI and Central Europe reporting units had fair values that exceed their carrying values by 15.1% and 4.9%, respectively, as of August 31, 2011. Central Europe is
still in the investment stage, and, accordingly, its fair value does not exceed its carrying value by a significant margin at this point in time. A deterioration of the UKI or Central Europe
businesses or their failure to achieve the forecasted results could lead to impairments in future periods. Our Western Europe reporting unit's fair value was less than its carrying value, and, as a
result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $46.5 million included as a component of intangible impairments from continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations for
the year ended December 31, 2011. A tax benefit of approximately $5.4 million was recorded associated with the Western Europe goodwill impairment charge for the year ended
December 31, 2011 and is included in the provision from income taxes from continuing operations.

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2010, prior to our annual goodwill impairment review, we concluded that events occurred and circumstances changed in our former worldwide
digital business



reporting
unit that required us to conduct an impairment review. The primary factors contributing to our conclusion that we had a triggering event and a requirement to reassess our former worldwide
digital business reporting unit goodwill for impairment included: (1) a reduction in forecasted revenue and operating results due to continued pressure on key parts of the business as a result
of the weak economy; (2) reduced revenue and profit outlook for our eDiscovery service due to smaller average matter size and lower pricing; (3) a decision to discontinue certain
software development projects; and (4) the sale of the Domain Name Product Line. As a result of the review, we recorded a provisional goodwill impairment charge associated with our former
worldwide digital business reporting unit in the amount of $255.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. We finalized the estimate in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we
recorded an additional impairment of $28.8 million, for a total goodwill impairment charge of $283.8 million. Based on a relative fair value basis, we allocated $85.9 million of
this charge to the retained technology escrow services business which continues to be included in our continuing results of operations. Our technology escrow services business had previously been
reported in the former worldwide digital business segment along with the Digital Business and the Domain Name Product Line. The technology escrow services business is now reported in the North
American Business segment.

Our
consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the
U.S. In 2009, we saw decreases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the weakening of the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis
of weighted average exchange rates for the comparable periods. In 2010, we saw increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Canadian
dollar, slightly offset by a weakening of the Euro, against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average exchange rates for the comparable periods. In 2011, we saw increases in both
revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro, against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average exchange rates for the
comparable periods. It is difficult to predict how much foreign currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future and how those fluctuations will impact our consolidated statement of operations.
Due to the expansion of our international operations, these fluctuations have become material on individual balances. However, because both the revenues and expenses are denominated in the local
currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income and operating margin is partially mitigated. In order to provide a framework
for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percentage change in the results from one period to another period in this
report using constant currency disclosure. The constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2009 results at the 2010 average exchange rates and the 2010 results at the 2011 average
exchange rates.

Prior
to January 1, 2010, the financial position and results of operations of the operating subsidiaries of IME, our European business, were consolidated based on IME's fiscal
year ended October 31. Effective January 1, 2010, we changed the fiscal year-end (and the reporting period for consolidation purposes) of IME to coincide with IMI's fiscal
year-end of December 31. We believe that the change in accounting principle related to the elimination of the two-month reporting lag for IME is preferable because it
results in more contemporaneous reporting of events and results related to IME. In accordance with applicable
accounting literature, a change in a subsidiary's year-end is treated as a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application. The impact of the change was not material
to the results of operations for the previously reported annual and interim periods prior to January 1, 2010, and, thus, those results have not been revised. There is, however, a charge of
$4.7 million recorded to other (income) expense, net in the year ended December 31, 2010 to recognize the immaterial differences arising from the change.

Non-GAAP Measures

Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation, Amortization and Intangible Impairments ("Adjusted OIBDA")

Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments and (gain) loss on
disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net. Adjusted OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. We use multiples of current or projected
Adjusted OIBDA in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA
Margin provide current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding our ability to generate cash flow to support business investment. These measures are an integral part of
the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. Adjusted OIBDA does not include certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core
operating results, specifically: (1) (gain) and loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net; (2) intangible impairments; (3) other expense
(income), net; (4) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle; (5) income (loss) from discontinued operations; (6) gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations; and
(7) net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Adjusted
OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision (benefit) for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which
we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, Adjusted OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses in order to eliminate the impact
of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin should be
considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as operating or net income (loss) or cash flows from operating
activities from continuing operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP).

Free Cash Flows before Acquisitions and Discretionary Investments ("FCF")

FCF is defined as Cash Flows from Operating Activities—Continuing Operations less capital expenditures (excluding real
estate), net of proceeds from the sales of property and equipment and other, net, and additions to customer relationship and acquisition costs. Our management uses this measure when evaluating the
operating performance of our consolidated business. We believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. FCF is a useful measure in determining our
ability to generate excess cash that may be used for reinvestment in the business, discretionary deployment in investments such as real estate or acquisition opportunities, returning of capital to our
stockholders and voluntary prepayments of indebtedness.

Adjusted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations ("Adjusted EPS")

Adjusted EPS from continuing operations is defined as reported earnings per share from continuing operations excluding:
(a) (gain) loss on the disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net; (b) intangible impairments; (c) other expense (income), net; and (d) the tax
impact of reconciling items and discrete tax items. We do not believe these excluded items to be indicative of our ongoing operating results, and they are not considered when we are forecasting our
future results. We believe Adjusted EPS from continuing operations is of value to investors when comparing our results from past, present and future periods.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of



contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates used. We base our estimates on historical
experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following,
which are listed in no particular order:

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes. Storage
revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data
(generally on a per unit basis). Service revenues are comprised of charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services. Included in core service
revenues are: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refilling of removed records and the destruction of records;
(2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring
services, including hybrid services and recurring project revenues. Our complementary services revenues include special project work, customer termination and permanent withdrawal fees, data
restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). A by-product of our
secure shredding and destruction services is the sale of recycled paper (included in complementary services revenues), the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility
and reducing the predictability of that revenue stream.

We
recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided, and customers are generally
billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts for customers where storage fees or services are billed in
advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Revenue from the sales of products, which is
included as a component of service revenues, is recognized when products are shipped to the customer and title has passed to the customer. Revenues from the sales of products have historically
not been significant.

Accounting for Acquisitions

Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of each acquisition has been
determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected
synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources.

Each
acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition. Accounting for
these acquisitions
has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each
acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment based on the final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating
leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memos

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our
customers to make required payments and potential disputes regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our
aged receivables and credit memo activity, current economic conditions and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly
change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. We consider accounts receivable to be delinquent after
such time as reasonable means of collection have been exhausted. We charge-off uncollectible balances as circumstances warrant, generally no later than one year past due. As of
December 31, 2010 and 2011, our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos balance totaled $20.7 million and $23.3 million, respectively.

Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets

Assets subject to amortization: We review long-lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash
flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If
the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long-lived assets of the
operation, to fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets.

Goodwill—Assets
not subject to amortization: Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment, or more
frequently if impairment indicators arise. We have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of
October 1, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and noted no impairment of goodwill. However, as a result of interim triggering events as discussed below, we recorded provisional goodwill impairment charges in
each of the third quarters of 2010 and 2011 in conjunction with the Digital Sale and associated with our European operations, respectively. These provisional goodwill impairment charges were
finalized in the fourth quarters of the 2010 and 2011 fiscal years, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, no factors were identified that would alter our October 1, 2011 goodwill
assessment. In making this assessment, we relied on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and market place data. There are
inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, the
goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values.

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2010, prior to our annual goodwill impairment review, we concluded that events occurred and circumstances changed in our former worldwide
digital business reporting unit that required us to conduct an impairment review. The primary factors contributing to our conclusion that we had a triggering event and a requirement to reassess our
former worldwide digital business reporting unit goodwill for impairment included: (1) a reduction in forecasted revenue and operating results due to continued pressure on key parts of the
business as a result of the weak economy; (2) reduced revenue and profit outlook for our eDiscovery service due to smaller average matter size and lower pricing; (3) a decision to
discontinue certain software development projects; and (4) the sale of the Domain Name Product Line. As a result of the review, we recorded a provisional goodwill impairment charge associated
with our former worldwide digital business reporting unit in the amount of $255.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. We finalized the estimate in the fourth quarter of
2010, and we recorded an additional impairment of $28.8 million, for a total



goodwill
impairment charge of $283.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, based on a relative fair value basis, we allocated $85.9 million of this charge to the retained
technology escrow services business which continues to be included in our continuing results of operations. The technology escrow services business had previously been reported in the former worldwide
digital business segment along with the Digital Business and the Domain Name Product Line and is now reported in the North American Business segment.

In
September 2011, as a result of certain changes we made in the manner in which our European operations are managed, we reorganized our reporting structure and reassigned goodwill among
the revised reporting units. Previously, we tested goodwill impairment at the European level on a combined basis. As a result of the management and reporting changes, we concluded that we have three
reporting units for our European operations: (1) UKI; (2) Western Europe; and (3) Central Europe. Due to these changes, we will perform all future goodwill impairment analyses on
the new reporting unit basis. As a result of the restructuring of our reporting units, we concluded that we had an interim triggering event,
and, therefore, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe in the third quarter of 2011 as of August 31, 2011. As required by GAAP, prior to our
goodwill impairment analysis, we performed an impairment assessment on the long-lived assets within our UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe reporting units and noted no impairment,
except for the Italian Business, which was included in our Western Europe reporting unit, and which is now included in discontinued operations as discussed at Note 14 to Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. Based on our analyses, we concluded that the goodwill of our UKI and Central Europe reporting units was not impaired. Our UKI and Central Europe reporting units had fair values
that exceed their carrying values by 15.1% and 4.9%, respectively, as of August 31, 2011. Central Europe is still in the investment stage, and, accordingly, its fair value does not exceed its
carrying value by a significant margin at this point in time. A deterioration of the UKI or Central Europe businesses or their failure to achieve the forecasted results could lead to impairments in
future periods. Our Western Europe reporting unit's fair value was less than its carrying value, and, as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $46.5 million included as a
component of intangible impairments from continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. A tax benefit of approximately
$5.4 million was recorded associated with the Western Europe goodwill impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2011 and is included in the provision for income taxes from
continuing operations.

Our
reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2010 were as follows: North America; Europe; Latin America; Australia; Joint
Ventures (which includes India, the various joint ventures in Southeast Asia and Russia (referred to as "Joint Ventures")); and Business Process Management ("BPM"). Given their similar economic
characteristics, products, customers and processes, (1) the United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway and (2) the countries of Continental Europe (excluding Joint Ventures), each a reporting
unit, have been aggregated as Europe and tested as one for goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of goodwill, net amounted to $1,750.4 million,
$438.3 million, $29.8 million and $61.0 million for North America, Europe, Latin America and Australia, respectively. Our Joint Ventures and BPM reporting units had no goodwill as
of December 31, 2010. Our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2011 were as follows: North America; UKI; Western Europe; Central
Europe; Latin America; Australia; and Joint Ventures. As of December 31, 2011, the carrying value of goodwill, net amounted to $1,748.9 million, $306.2 million,
$46.4 million, $63.8 million, $27.3 million, and $61.7 million for North America, UKI, Western Europe, Central Europe, Latin America and Australia, respectively. Our Joint
Ventures reporting unit has no goodwill as of December 31, 2011. Our North America, Latin America and Australia reporting units had estimated fair values as of October 1, 2011 that
exceeded their carrying value by greater than 40%.



Reporting
unit valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit or a combined approach based on the present
value of future cash flows and market and transaction multiples of revenues and earnings. The income approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected
capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. In conjunction with our
annual
goodwill impairment reviews, we reconcile the sum of the valuations of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of such dates.

Accounting for Internal Use Software

We develop various software applications for internal use. Computer software costs associated with internal use software are expensed
as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer
software projects (to the extent time is spent directly on the project) are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of
the application has been completed and it is probable that the application will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service.
Computer software costs that are capitalized are periodically evaluated for impairment.

It
may be necessary for us to write-off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. We may be required to
write-off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the software's estimated
useful life. Capitalized labor net of accumulated depreciation was $33.7 million as of both December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. See Note 2.f. to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

During
the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2011, we wrote-off $0.6 million (primarily in Corporate) and $3.5 million (approximately $3.1 million
associated with our International Business segment and approximately $0.4 million associated with our North American Business segment), respectively, of previously deferred software costs
associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued after implementation, which resulted in a loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment,
net in each of these years.

Income Taxes

We recorded a valuation allowance, amounting to $72.2 million as of December 31, 2011, to reduce our deferred tax assets,
primarily associated with certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards, to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have federal
net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2020 through 2025 of $28.2 million ($9.9 million, tax effected) at December 31, 2011 to reduce future federal taxable
income. We have an asset for state net operating losses of $7.9 million (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to expire in 2012 through 2025, subject to a valuation allowance of
approximately
99%. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $40.3 million, with various expiration dates, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 69%. We also have foreign tax credits of
$56.6 million, which begin to expire in 2014 through 2019, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 65%. U.S. legislative changes in 2010 reduced the expected utilization of
foreign tax credits which resulted in the requirement for a valuation allowance. If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of
our net deferred income tax assets and foreign tax credit carryforwards, and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be
given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in
the period in which such determination is made.



The
evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby the company determines whether it is more likely than not
that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a
measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax
position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

We
are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments
by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2010 and 2011, we had approximately $59.9 million and $31.4 million, respectively, of reserves
related to uncertain tax positions. The reversal of these reserves will be recorded as a reduction of our income tax provision if sustained. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the
final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in our estimates.

We
have elected to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision (benefit) for income taxes. We recorded $4.7 million,
$(1.6) million and $(8.5) million for gross interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

We
had $11.6 million and $2.8 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

We
have not provided deferred taxes on book basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future
and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis differences could be
reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries and certain other events or actions on our part, each of which would result in an increase in our provision for
income taxes. It is not practicable to calculate the amount of such basis differences.

Stock-Based Compensation

We record stock-based compensation expense, utilizing the straight-line method, for the cost of stock options, restricted
stock, restricted stock units, performance units and shares of stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan. Stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010
and 2011 was $18.7 million, including $3.5 million in discontinued operations, ($14.7 million after tax or $0.07 per basic and diluted share), $20.4 million, including
$3.1 million in discontinued operations, ($15.7 million after tax or $0.08 per basic and diluted share) and $17.5 million, including $0.3 million in discontinued
operations, ($8.8 million after tax or $0.05 per basic and diluted share), respectively.

The
fair values of option grants are estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility and the expected term are the input factors to that
model which require the most significant management judgment. Expected volatility is calculated utilizing daily historical volatility over a period that equates to the expected life of the option. The
expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) of the stock options granted is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees.

Self-Insured Liabilities

We are self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers' compensation claims, vehicle accidents,
property and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare



and
short-term disability programs. At December 31, 2010 and 2011, there were approximately $43.9 million and $39.4 million, respectively, of
self-insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the
present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including
those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date.

We
believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any
estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these
expenses are appropriate. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2011-08,

Intangibles—Goodwill and Other
(Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment.

ASU 2011-08 allows but does not require entities to
first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative two-step impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required.
ASU 2011-08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The adoption
of this ASU 2011-08 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Constant
currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2010 results at the 2011 average exchange rates and the 2009 results at the 2010 average
exchange rates.

(2)

Our
internal revenue growth rate represents the weighted average year-over-year growth rate of our revenues after removing the
effects of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations.

Our
consolidated storage revenues increased $84.3 million, or 5.3%, to $1,683.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and
$64.9 million, or 4.2%, to $1,598.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2010, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 is comprised of internal revenue growth of
3.1%. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations added approximately 1.4% to our storage revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2011. Net acquisitions/divestitures contributed
0.8% of the increase in reported storage revenues in 2011. Our consolidated storage revenue growth in 2011 was driven by continued solid storage growth in the International Business segment and
consistent volume and price increases in our North American Business segment. The growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 2009 is comprised of internal revenue growth of
3.1%. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations added 1.1% to our storage revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our consolidated storage revenue growth was
moderated in 2010 by economic factors, resulting in reduced average net pricing gains in North America due to the low inflationary environment, episodic destructions in the physical data protection
business and lower new sales and higher destruction rates in our North American Business segment, which were offset by new sales in international markets.



Consolidated service revenues, consisting of core service and complementary services, increased $38.1 million, or 2.9%, to $1,331.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2011 from $1,293.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Service revenue internal growth was 0.4% driven by complementary service revenue internal
growth of 3.7% in 2011, partially offset by negative core service revenue internal growth of 0.8% in 2011. Complementary service revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to
$25.8 million of additional revenue generated from the sale of recycled paper due, in part, to increases in paper prices. Paper prices, however, declined significantly during the fourth quarter
of 2011 and into 2012. Should paper prices remain at their current levels throughout 2012, we would expect revenues from the sale of recycled paper to be lower in 2012 than in 2011. Core service
revenue internal growth in the year ended December 31, 2011 continued to be constrained by current economic trends and pressures on activity-based service revenues related to the handling and
transportation of items in storage. These decreases were partially offset by strong hybrid revenue growth and higher fuel surcharges. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased reported
service revenues by 1.7% in 2011 over the same period in 2010. Net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 0.8% of the increase in reported service revenues in 2011 compared to the same period in 2010.
Consolidated service revenues, consisting of core service and complementary services, increased $53.0 million, or 4.3%, to $1,293.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010
from $1,240.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Service revenue internal growth was 3.0% as complementary service revenue internal growth of 15.6% in 2010 was offset by
negative core service revenue internal growth of 0.9% in 2010. Complementary service revenues increased in 2010 primarily due to $36.8 million more revenue resulting from higher recycled paper
pricing and gains in hybrid service revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Core service revenue internal growth in the year ended December 31, 2010 was
constrained by economic trends and pressures on activity-based service revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage. Favorable foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 increased reported service revenues 1.3%.

For
the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $122.4 million, or 4.2%, to $3,014.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from
$2,892.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded reductions to reported revenues of $6.0 million,
$6.0 million and $4.8 million, respectively, related to a billing error involving a government contract. See Note 2.y. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We calculate
internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations. Internal revenue growth was 1.9% for 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2011, foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations increased our consolidated revenues by 1.5% primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of
weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Net acquisitions/divestitures contributed 0.8% of the increase in total reported revenues in 2011 over the same period in 2010.
Our consolidated revenues increased $118.0 million, or 4.3%, to $2,892.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $2,774.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2009. Internal revenue growth was 3.1% for 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2010, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased our reported revenues by 1.2%
primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, offset by the weakening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of
weighted average rates for the comparable periods.

We
expect our consolidated internal revenue growth for 2012 to be approximately (1)% to 2%. During the past eight quarters our storage revenue internal growth rate has ranged between
2.3% and 4.3%. Our storage revenue growth rate moderated in late 2009 and into 2010 due to the economic downturn, which resulted in reduced average net pricing gains in North America due to the low
inflationary environment, episodic destructions in the physical data protection business and lower new sales and higher destruction rates in our North American Business segment. These impacts were
offset by new sales in international markets. Our storage growth rate in 2011 was driven by continued solid storage growth in the International Business segment and sustained growth in our North
American Business segment. The internal revenue growth rate for service revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage revenue internal growth rate due to the more discretionary nature of
certain complementary services we offer, such as large special projects, and the volatility of prices for recycled paper. These revenues, which are often event driven and impacted to a greater extent
by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of certain services as a way to reduce their short-term costs, may be difficult to replicate in future periods. As a
commodity, recycled paper prices are subject to the volatility of that market. The revenue internal growth rate for service revenues reflects the following: (1) pressures on activity-based
service revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage and secure shredding; (2) the expected softness in our complementary service revenues, such as project revenues
and fulfillment services; and (3) improvement in commodity prices for recycled paper during the first half of fiscal year 2011 and higher fuel surcharges.

Labor

Labor expense decreased to 19.7% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 20.1% for the year
ended December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011, labor expense was unfavorably impacted by 1.8 percentage points due to currency rate changes. Excluding
(1) the effect of currency rate fluctuations and (2) the impact associated with labor cost accruals related to the Brazilian litigation, in which a charge of $7.4 million was
recorded in 2010 and a benefit of $3.5 million was recorded in 2011, labor expense increased by 2.6% in 2011 over 2010 primarily due to increased incentive compensation of $8.0 million
as well as increased health insurance expenses of $5.0 million.

Labor
expense decreased to 20.1% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 21.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended
December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, labor expense was unfavorably impacted by 1.0 percentage points due to currency rate changes. Excluding the
effect of currency rate fluctuations, labor expense decreased by 2.3% in 2010 primarily due to productivity gains in our North American Business segment, lower core service levels and lower incentive
compensation expense of $12.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2010.

Facilities

Facilities costs were flat at 14.0% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.
Facilities costs were unfavorably impacted by 1.7 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2011. The largest component of our facilities cost is
rent expense, which, on a reported dollar basis, decreased to 12.5% of consolidated storage revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 13.0% in the same period in 2010. Other
facilities costs increased by approximately $10.1 million, in constant currency terms, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily
due to increased building maintenance costs of $6.9 million and increased insurance costs of $5.4 million.

Facilities
costs decreased to 14.0% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 14.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Facilities costs
were unfavorably impacted by 0.7 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent
expense, which decreased on a reported dollar basis to 13.0% of consolidated storage revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 13.4% in the same period in 2009. Other facilities
costs decreased by approximately $2.0 million, in constant currency terms, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to
decreased building maintenance charges of $2.2 million.



Transportation

Transportation expenses were unfavorably impacted by 2.0 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended
December 31, 2011. Transportation expenses increased by $15.7 million in constant currency terms during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. The
increase in transportation costs was primarily a result of increased third party transportation costs of $7.1 million, increased fuel costs of $6.3 million and increased vehicle repair,
rental and insurance costs of $2.0 million.

Transportation
expenses were unfavorably impacted by 0.6 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. Transportation expenses
decreased by $3.1 million in constant currency terms during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. A decrease of $3.3 million in vehicle lease
expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the capitalization of leased vehicles upon renewal. The lease cost did not change, but the categorization of charges
did, resulting in the cost now being allocated to depreciation and interest.

Product Cost of Sales and Other

Product cost of sales and other, which includes cartons, media and other service, storage and supply costs, is highly correlated to
complementary revenue streams. These costs were unfavorably impacted by 2.1 percentage points of currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2011. For 2011, product cost of
sales and other increased by $3.8 million as compared to 2010 on an actual basis.

Product
cost of sales and other was unfavorably impacted by 3.5 percentage points of currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. For 2010, these costs
decreased by $0.1 million as compared to 2009 on an actual basis.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses increased to 15.6% of consolidated revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to
15.4% in the year ended December 31, 2010. General and administrative expenses were unfavorably impacted by 1.5 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended
December 31, 2011. In constant currency terms, general and administrative expenses increased by $17.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in
2010. The increase was primarily attributable to $15.0 million of advisory fees and other costs in the first and second quarter of 2011 associated with our 2011 proxy contest and a
$16.1 million increase in incentive compensation, partially offset by a reduction of $16.2 million in other professional fees within North America related to productivity investments
incurred in 2010 and which did not repeat in 2011.

General
and administrative expenses decreased to 15.4% of consolidated revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 15.6% in the year ended December 31, 2009.
General and administrative expenses were unfavorably impacted by 0.8 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. In constant currency terms,
general and administrative expenses increased by $9.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to
increased compensation expense of $8.8 million. The increased compensation during the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily a result of merit increases, increased medical and other
benefits, as well as increased headcount primarily related to our continued investment in our hybrid records management services of $19.6 million, all of which were partially offset by a
reduction in incentive compensation of $10.9 million.

Sales, Marketing & Account Management

Sales, marketing and account management expenses were unfavorably impacted by 1.8 percentage points due to currency rate changes
during the year ended December 31, 2011. In constant currency terms, the increase of $26.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily related to increased sales and
marketing expenses, primarily related to a planned incremental investment of $20.0 million within North America to sustain the revenue annuity, primarily resulting in increased compensation of
$23.9 million, due to increased sales commissions, payroll tax expenses and incentive compensation.

Sales,
marketing and account management expenses were unfavorably impacted by 1.5 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. In
constant currency terms, the increase of $5.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily related to $2.9 million of increased marketing costs and $1.5 million
of increased professional fees.



Information Technology

Information technology expenses were unfavorably impacted by 1.5 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year
ended December 31, 2011. In constant currency terms, information technology expenses increased $8.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in
2010 due primarily to an increase in incentive compensation and related payroll taxes of $6.1 million and health insurance and other benefit costs of $2.9 million.

Information
technology expenses were favorably impacted by 0.3 percentage point due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. In constant currency
terms, information technology expenses increased $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily a result of increased overhead expenses of $5.4 million, partially
offset by decreased compensation of $5.3 million, which offset was driven by lower incentive compensation.

Bad Debt Expense

Consolidated bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $2.3 million to $9.5 million (0.3% of
consolidated revenues) from $11.8 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that is calculated based on
our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. We continue to monitor our
customers' payment activity and make adjustments based on their financial condition and in light of historical and expected trends.

Consolidated
bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $2.8 million to $11.8 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) from $9.0 million
(0.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) Loss on Disposal/Write-down of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Depreciation expense increased $11.9 million and $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, primarily due to additional depreciation expense related to capital expenditures and acquisitions, including storage
systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems, hardware and software, and buildings primarily in our International Business segment.

Amortization
expense increased $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to an increase of
customer relationship intangible assets acquired related to the Poland acquisition. Amortization expense increased $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year
ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to the increased amortization of intangible assets, such as customer relationship intangible assets acquired through business combinations.

Consolidated
gain on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 consisted primarily of
(a) a gain of approximately $3.2 million related to the disposition of a facility in Canada and (b) a gain of approximately $3.0 million on the retirement of leased
vehicles accounted for as capital lease assets in North America, offset by (c) a loss associated with discontinued use of certain third-party software licenses of approximately
$3.5 million (approximately $3.1 million associated with our International Business segment and approximately $0.4 million associated with our North American Business segment).
Consolidated gain on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net of $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 consisted primarily of a gain of
approximately $10.2 million as a result of the settlement with our insurers in connection with a portion of the property component of our claim related to the Chilean



earthquake
in the third and fourth quarter of 2010, gains of approximately $3.2 million in North America primarily related to the disposition of certain owned equipment and a gain on disposal
of a building in our International Business segment of approximately $1.3 million in the United Kingdom, offset by approximately $1.0 million of asset write-downs associated with our
Latin American operations and approximately $2.6 million of impairment losses primarily related to certain owned facilities in North America. Consolidated loss on
disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, consisted primarily of a gain on disposal of a building in our
International Business segment of approximately $1.9 million in France, offset by losses on the write-down of certain facilities of approximately $1.0 million in
our North American Business segment, $0.7 million in our International Business segment and $0.3 million in Corporate (associated with discontinued products after implementation).

Intangible Impairments

During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, prior to our annual goodwill impairment review, we concluded that events occurred
and circumstances changed in our former worldwide digital business reporting unit that required us to conduct an impairment review. The primary factors contributing to our conclusion that we had a
triggering event and a requirement to reassess our former worldwide digital business reporting unit goodwill for impairment included: (1) a reduction in forecasted revenue and operating results
due to continued pressure on key parts of the business as a result of the weak economy; (2) reduced revenue and profit outlook for our eDiscovery service due to smaller average matter size and
lower pricing; (3) a decision to discontinue certain software development projects; and (4) the sale of the Domain Name Product Line. As a result of the review, we recorded a provisional
goodwill impairment charge associated with our former worldwide digital business reporting unit in the amount of $255.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. We finalized
the estimate in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we recorded an additional impairment of $28.8 million, for a total goodwill impairment charge of $283.8 million. Based on a relative fair
value basis, we allocated $85.9 million of this charge to the retained technology escrow services business, which continues to be included in our continuing results of operations. We retained
our technology escrow services business, which had previously been reported in the former worldwide digital business segment along with the Digital Business and the Domain Name Product Line. The
technology escrow services business is now reported in the North American Business segment.

In
September 2011, as a result of certain changes we made in the manner in which our European operations are managed, we reorganized our reporting structure and reassigned goodwill among
the revised reporting units. As a result of the management and reporting changes, we concluded that we have three reporting units for our European operations: (1) UKI; (2) Western
Europe; and (3) Central Europe. Due to these changes, we will perform all future goodwill impairment analysis on the new reporting unit basis. As a result of the restructuring of our reporting
units, we concluded that we had an interim triggering event, and, therefore, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe in the third quarter of 2011 as
of August 31, 2011. As required by GAAP, prior to our goodwill impairment analysis, we performed an impairment assessment on the long-lived assets within our UKI, Western Europe and
Central Europe reporting units and noted no impairment, except for the Italian Business, which was included in our Western Europe reporting unit, and which is now included in discontinued operations
below. Based on our analyses, we concluded that the goodwill of our UKI and Central Europe reporting units was not impaired. Our Western Europe reporting unit's fair value was less than its carrying
value, and, as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $46.5 million included as a component of intangible impairments from continuing operations in our consolidated statements of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Net
foreign currency transaction losses of $17.4 million, based on period-end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2011. Losses were
primarily a result of British pound sterling denominated debt and forward foreign currency swap contracts and changes in the exchange rate of the Euro, Russian Ruble and certain Latin American
currencies against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2010, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our European and Latin American subsidiaries.
Partially offsetting these losses were gains
which resulted primarily from our Euro denominated bonds issued by IMI as well as changes in the exchange rate of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31,
2010, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our United Kingdom subsidiaries.

Net
foreign currency transaction losses of $5.7 million, based on period-end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2010. Losses resulted
primarily from changes in the exchange rate of the British pounds sterling, the Euro and the Russian Ruble, offset by the Brazilian Real, against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2009,
as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our European and Latin American subsidiaries, and gains associated with our British pound sterling forward contracts, British
pound sterling denominated debt and Euro denominated debt issued by IMI.

Net
foreign currency transaction gains of $12.9 million, based on period-end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2009. Gains resulted
primarily from changes in the exchange rate of the British pounds sterling, Euro, Brazilian Real and Chilean Peso against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2008, as these currencies
relate to our intercompany balances with and between our European and Latin American subsidiaries, offset by losses as a result of British pounds sterling and Euro denominated debt and forward foreign
currency swap contracts held by our U.S. parent company.

During
the year ended December 31, 2011 we recorded a gain of approximately $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2011 related to the early extinguishment of
$231.3 million of our 7


/


% Notes due 2015 that were redeemed. This gain consists of original issue premiums, net of deferred financing costs related to our 7


/


%
Notes due 2015 that were redeemed. Additionally, we recorded a charge of $1.8 million in the second quarter of 2011 related to the early retirement of our previous revolving credit and term
loan facilities, representing a write-off of deferred financing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we redeemed $200.0 million of the $431.3 million
aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 7


/


% Notes due 2015 at a redemption price of $1,012.92 for each one thousand dollars of principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2010 related to the early extinguishment of our


/


% Notes due 2015 that were redeemed. This charge consists of the call premium and deferred financing costs, net of original issue premiums related to our 7


/


% Notes
due 2015 that were redeemed. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we redeemed our 8


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 and wrote-off $3.0 million in
associated deferred financing costs.

Other,
net for the year ended December 31, 2011 was a gain of $5.3 million, which primarily consists of a $5.9 million gain associated with the fair valuing of the
20% equity interest that we previously held in our Polish joint venture in connection with our acquisition of the remaining 80%



interest
in January 2011. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2010 was a $1.3 million loss. Included in the loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $4.7 million
of losses related to the impact of the change in IME's fiscal year-end. Since its inception, IME had operated with an October 31 fiscal year-end. IME's financial results
had historically been consolidated with IMI's results with a two month lag. In order to better align our European processes with the enterprise, effective January 1, 2010, the IME fiscal
year-end was changed to December 31 to match the Company's fiscal year-end. The $4.7 million charge represents the net impact of this change for the two years
ended December 31, 2009. Partially offsetting this loss was $1.2 million of gains related to certain trading marketable securities held in a trust for the benefit of employees included
in a deferred compensation plan we sponsor. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily consisted of $1.7 million of gains related to certain trading marketable securities
held in a trust for the benefit of employees included in a deferred compensation plan we sponsor, in addition to $0.6 million of business interruption proceeds for an owned storage facility in
France, which was taken by eminent domain in the first quarter of 2009.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 were 32.9%, 50.1% and 30.2%, respectively. The
primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 was the recognition of certain previously
unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions of prior years, expirations of statute of limitation periods and settlements with tax authorities in various jurisdictions and differences in the
rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. This benefit was partially offset by state
income taxes (net of federal benefit). Additionally, to a lesser extent, a goodwill impairment charge included in income from continuing operations as a component of intangible impairments in our
consolidated statements of operations, of which a majority was non-deductible for tax purposes, is a reconciling item that impacts our effective tax rate. The primary reconciling item
between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 is a goodwill impairment charge included in income from continuing operations
as a component of intangible impairments in our consolidated statements of operations, of which a majority was non-deductible for tax purposes. The negative impact of U.S. legislative
changes reducing the expected utilization of foreign tax credits was offset by the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits due to expirations of statute of limitation periods and
settlements with tax authorities in various jurisdictions. Additionally, to a lesser extent, state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign
earnings are subject, including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates, are also reconciling items and impact our effective tax rate. In 2009, we had
significant unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany loans and on debt and derivative instruments in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. For 2009, foreign currency
gains were recorded in lower tax jurisdictions associated with the marking-to-market of intercompany loan positions while foreign currency losses were recorded in higher tax
jurisdictions associated with the
marking-to-market of debt and derivative instruments, which reduced the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Our
effective tax rate is subject to variability in the future due to, among other items: (1) changes in the mix of income from foreign jurisdictions; (2) tax law changes;
(3) volatility in foreign exchange gains and (losses); (4) the timing of the establishment and reversal of tax reserves; and (5) our ability to utilize foreign tax credits that we
generate. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business
operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. Although we believe our tax estimates are



appropriate,
the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates. Discrete items are recorded in the period they occur.

INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2011
increased $79.7 million, or 47.8%, to $246.4 million (8.2% of consolidated revenues) from income from continuing operations of $166.7 million (5.8% of consolidated revenues) for
the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in income from continuing operations is primarily due to the year-over-year decrease of our provision for income taxes as
described above and the goodwill impairment charge recorded in fiscal year 2010 associated with our technology escrow services business, which was previously a component of our former worldwide
digital business segment, partially offset by the goodwill impairment charge recorded in fiscal year 2011 associated with our Western Europe reporting unit, as well as, the impact of foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations and the year-over-year change in the (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net.

As
a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $64.8 million, or 28.0%, to
$166.7 million (5.8% of consolidated revenues) from income from continuing operations of $231.5 million (8.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009. The
decrease in income from continuing operations is primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge associated with our technology escrow services business, which was previously a component of our former
worldwide digital business segment, as well as, foreign currency exchange rate impacts and the impact of the change in IME's fiscal year-end included in
other (income) expense, net and the impact of our tax rate for 2010 and the resulting increase in the provision for income taxes described above.

INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Loss from discontinued operations was $(12.1) million, $(219.4) million and $(47.4) million for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. We recorded a goodwill impairment charge associated with our former worldwide digital business reporting unit in the amount of $197.9 million during the year
ended December 31, 2010 net of the amount allocated to the retained technology escrow services business, based on a relative fair value basis, which continues to be included in our continuing
results of operations as previously discussed above. During 2011, we recorded an impairment charge of $4.9 million to write-down the long-lived assets of the New Zealand
Business to its estimated net realizable value which is included in loss from discontinued operations. Additionally, we recorded a tax benefit of $7.9 million during 2011 associated with the
outside tax basis of the New Zealand Business, which is also reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations. Additionally, in conjunction with the goodwill impairment analysis performed
associated with our Western Europe reporting unit, we performed an impairment test on the long-lived assets of our Italian Business in the third quarter of 2011. The undiscounted cash
flows from the Italian Business were lower than the carrying value of the long-lived assets associated with the operations of the Italian Business and resulted in the requirement to fair
value the long-lived assets of this lower level component. As a result, we recorded write-offs of other intangible assets, primarily customer relationship values of
$8.0 million, and certain write-downs to property, plant and equipment (primarily racking) long-lived assets in Italy of $6.6 million in the third quarter of 2011, which are
included in loss from discontinued operations. We allocated $2.5 million of the Western Europe goodwill impairment charge to the Italian Business which is included in loss from discontinued
operations for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Pursuant
to the Digital Sale Agreement, we received approximately $395.4 million in cash, consisting of the initial purchase price of $380.0 million and a preliminary
working capital adjustment of approximately $15.4 million, which remains subject to a customary post-closing adjustment based on



the
amount of working capital at closing. The purchase price for the Digital Sale will be increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis if the working capital balance at the time of
closing exceeds the target amount of working capital as set forth in the Digital Sale Agreement and decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis if such closing working capital
balance is less
than the target amount. We and Autonomy are in disagreement regarding the working capital adjustment in the Digital Sale Agreement. As a result, as contemplated by the Digital Sale Agreement, the
matter is being referred to an independent third party accounting firm for determination of the appropriate adjustment amount. Transaction costs relating to the Digital Sale amounted to approximately
$7.4 million. Additionally, $11.1 million of inducements are payable to Autonomy and have been netted against the proceeds in calculating the gain on the Digital Sale. Also, a tax
provision of $45.1 million associated with the gain recorded on the Digital Sale was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2011. A gain on sale of discontinued operations in the
amount of $243.9 million ($198.7 million, net of tax) was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2011, as a result of the Digital Sale. We completed the sale of the New
Zealand Business on October 3, 2011 for a purchase price of approximately $10.0 million. We recorded a gain on the sale of discontinued operations associated with the New Zealand
Business of approximately $1.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2011. A gain on sale of discontinued operations of approximately $6.9 million ($2.8 million, net of tax) was
recorded during the year ended December 31, 2010 associated with the divestiture of the Domain Name Product Line.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

For the year ended December 31, 2011, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in a decrease in net income
attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated of $4.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in a decrease in net income
attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated of $4.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in a reduction to net
income attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated of $1.4 million. These amounts represent our noncontrolling partners' share of earnings/losses in our majority-owned international subsidiaries
that are consolidated in our operating results.

Segment Analysis (in thousands)

As a result of the disposition of our Digital Business and New Zealand Business and our decision to sell the Italian Business as
discussed in Note 14 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we changed our reportable segments. The most significant of these changes is that the reportable segment previously referred
to as the worldwide digital business is no longer reported separately in our management reporting as the operations associated with the Domain Name Product Line and the Digital Business are reported
as discontinued operations. Also, the technology escrow services business, which we continue to own and operate and was previously reported in the former worldwide digital business segment, is now
reported in the North American Business segment. Additionally, the International Business segment no longer includes the New Zealand Business and the Italian Business as these operations are reported
as discontinued operations.

Our
reportable operating segments are North American Business, International Business and Corporate. See Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our North American
Business segment offers information management services throughout the United States and Canada, including the storage of paper documents, as well as other media such as microfilm and microfiche,
master audio and videotapes, film, X-rays and blueprints, including healthcare information services, vital records services, service and courier operations, and the collection, handling
and disposal of sensitive documents for corporate customers ("Hard Copy"); the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans, including service and courier
operations ("Data Protection"); information destruction services ("Destruction"); the scanning, imaging and document



conversion
services of active and inactive records ("Hybrid Services"); the storage, assembly, and detailed reporting of customer marketing literature and delivery to sales offices, trade shows and
prospective customers' sites based on current and prospective customer orders ("Fulfillment"), and technology escrow services that protect and manage source code. Our International Business segment
offers information management services throughout Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, including Hard Copy, Data Protection, Destruction and Hybrid Services. Corporate consists of costs related to
executive and staff functions, including finance, human resources and information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. These costs are primarily related to the general management of
these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of
implementation. Corporate also includes stock-based employee compensation expense associated with all employee stock-based awards.

During
the year ended December 31, 2011, revenue in our North American Business segment increased 1.6% over the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to internal
growth of 1.1%. Internal growth was due to storage internal growth of 2.2% related to increased new sales and lower volume outflows, partially offset by total service internal growth of negative 0.3%.
Our core service revenues were constrained by lower service and activity levels partially offset by higher fuel surcharges, yielding negative internal growth of 1.4% for the year ended
December 31, 2011, while our complementary service revenue yielded 2.5% internal growth as a result of higher pricing of recycled paper, as well as improved special project and product sales.
Additionally, favorable foreign currency rate changes related to the Canadian dollar resulted in increased 2011 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of 0.4% for the year ended
December 31, 2011. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due mainly to increases in sales
and marketing expenses of $27.5 million, inclusive of a planned incremental investment of $20.0 million to sustain the revenue annuity, and higher incentive compensation accruals of
$20.6 million, partially offset by a constant currency increase in revenue of



$26.0 million
and a reduction of $16.2 million in professional fees related to productivity investments incurred in 2010 and which did not repeat in 2011.

During
the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue in our North American Business segment increased 3.2% over the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to internal
growth of 2.3%. Total revenue internal growth was comprised of storage internal growth of 2.3% related to increased Hard Copy and Data Protection revenues and service internal growth of 2.4%. Economic
factors led to a moderation in our storage growth rate as a result of reduced average net pricing gains due to the current low inflationary environment, episodic destructions in the data protection
business and lower new sales and higher destruction rates in our physical business over the past year. Core service revenue growth was also constrained by economic trends and pressures on
activity-based services revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage. Our core services business yielded negative internal growth of 2.2%, which was more than offset by
complementary services revenues internal growth of 16.3%, due primarily to higher recycled paper prices and gains in hybrid service revenues. Additionally, favorable foreign currency rate changes
related to Canada resulted in increased 2010 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of 0.9%. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased in 2010 due mainly to productivity gains and
disciplined cost management, partially offset by a $5.5 million increase in general and administrative compensation and a $1.4 million increase in bad debt expense.

Revenue
in our International Business segment increased 12.4% during the year ended December 31, 2011 over 2010 due to internal growth of 4.3% and foreign currency fluctuations in
2011, primarily in Europe, which resulted in increased 2011 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of approximately 5.1% as compared to 2010. Total internal revenue growth for the segment for the year
ended December 31, 2011 was supported by solid 6.2% storage internal growth and total service internal growth of 2.3%. Acquisitions contributed 3.0% of the increase in total reported
international revenues in the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to our acquisitions in Poland in the first



quarter
of 2011 and Greece in the second quarter of 2010. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010
primarily due to increased operating income from productivity gains, pricing actions and disciplined cost management, offset by $5.9 million of additional productivity investments.

Revenue
in our International Business segment increased 7.6% during the year ended December 31, 2010 over 2009 due to internal revenue growth of 5.3% supported by storage internal
growth of 6.0% and core services internal growth of 2.4%. The impact of acquisitions increased reported revenue by
0.3% in 2010. Foreign currency fluctuations in 2010, primarily in Europe, resulted in increased 2010 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of approximately 2.0% as compared to 2009. Adjusted OIBDA
increased in 2010 by $10.5 million compared to the same period in 2009 due to increased operating income from productivity gains, pricing actions and disciplined cost management, partially
offset by increased compensation expense of $9.5 million primarily related to investments in our hybrid records management services, as well as one-time cost accruals recorded in
2010 of approximately $7.4 million.

During
the year ended December 31, 2011, expenses in the Corporate segment as a percentage of consolidated revenues increased 10.1% over 2010. This increase was primarily due to
$15.0 million of advisory fees and other costs associated with our 2011 proxy contest.

During
the year ended December 31, 2010, expenses in the Corporate segment increased 5.8% over 2009. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales, marketing and account
management expenses of $6.0 million, higher professional fees of $2.2 million related to productivity and cost saving initiatives, an insurance deductible of $2.8 million
associated with earthquakes, increased stock-based compensation of $2.1 million and increased marketing expenses, partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation.

Net
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $663.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $603.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2010. The 10.0% increase resulted primarily from an increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges of $31.3 million, a decrease in cash used for
working capital of $23.9 million and a decrease in realized foreign exchange losses of $5.1 million over the same period last year. Uses of working capital are primarily related to lower
taxes paid from continuing operations, excluding the $52.4 million of taxes paid as a result of the sale of our Digital Business which is classified in discontinued operations, lower amounts
paid for cash interest and cash incentive compensation in fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010, partially offset by a reduction in cash collections from customers associated with accounts
receivable. We expect our cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations to decrease in fiscal year 2012 as a result of a reduction in Adjusted OIBDA related to lower recycled
paper revenues, combined with higher interest costs and higher incentive compensation payouts compared to fiscal year 2011.

Our
business requires significant capital expenditures to support our expected revenue growth and ongoing operations as well as new products and services and increased profitability.
These expenditures are included in the cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations. The nature of our capital expenditures has evolved over time along with the nature of our
business. We make capital expenditures to support a number of different objectives. The majority of our capital goes to support business line growth and our ongoing operations, but we also expend
capital to support the development and improvement of products and services and projects designed to increase our profitability. These expenditures are generally small and more discretionary in
nature. Cash paid for our capital expenditures, cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired) and additions to customer acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2011 amounted to
$209.2 million, $75.2 million and $21.7 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2011, capital expenditures, net, cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash
acquired) and additions to customer acquisition costs were funded with cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations and cash equivalents on hand. Excluding potential future
acquisitions, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $215.0 million in the year ending December 31, 2012. Included in our estimated capital expenditures for 2012 is
approximately $25.0 million of real estate purchases.

Net
cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $762.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. During 2011, we received
(i) $394.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of our 7


/


% Notes due 2019; (ii) net borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan facilities and other debt
of $153.8 million; and (iii) $85.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan. We used the proceeds from these
financing transactions and cash on hand: (i) for the early retirement of $231.3 million of our 7


/


% Notes due 2015; (ii) to repurchase $985.0 million of our
common stock; (iii) to pay dividends in the amount of $172.6 million on our common stock; and (iv) to fund debt financing costs of $9.0 million.

Our
board of directors has authorized up to $1.2 billion in repurchases of our common stock. All purchases are subject to stock price, market conditions, corporate and
legal requirements and other factors. As of December 31, 2011, we had a remaining amount available for repurchase under our share repurchase program of $100.7 million, which represents
approximately 2% in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock based on the closing price on such date.

February 2010, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we have paid and in the future intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Declaration and
payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors. In fiscal years 2010 and 2011, our board of directors declared the following dividends:

We
are committed to stockholder payouts through a combination of share buybacks, ongoing quarterly dividends and potential one-time dividends of approximately
$2.2 billion through 2013, with approximately $1.2 billion of capital returned to stockholders by May 2012. Through February 10, 2012, we have returned approximately
$1.15 billion to stockholders against these commitments. We expect to fund future payouts with cash flows from operations and borrowings under existing and potentially additional debt
instruments. With regard to our levels of indebtedness, we plan to operate around the mid-point of our target leverage ratio range of 3x—4x EBITDA (as defined in our revolving
credit facility).

Financial
instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits), restricted cash
(primarily U.S. Treasuries) and accounts receivable. The only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of December 31, 2011 relate to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash
held on deposit with five global banks and one "Triple A" rated money market fund which we consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade institutions. As per our risk management investment
policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund or financial institution to a maximum of $50.0 million. As of
December 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents and



restricted
cash balance was $215.0 million, including a money market fund and time deposits amounting to $181.8 million. A substantial portion of the money market fund is invested in
U.S. Treasuries.

We
are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2011 was comprised of the following (in

The
capital stock or other equity interests of most of our U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our
first-tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure these debt instruments, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S.
subsidiary guarantors.

(2)

Collectively,
the "Parent Notes". IMI is the direct obligor on the Parent Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated
basis, by substantially all of its direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. Iron Mountain Canada
Corporation ("Canada Company") and the remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Parent Notes.

(3)

Canada
Company is the direct obligor on the Subsidiary Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by IMI and the
Guarantors. These guarantees are joint and several obligations of IMI and the Guarantors.

Includes
(a) real estate mortgages of $5.2 million, (b) capital lease obligations of $207.3 million, and (c) other
various notes and other obligations, which were assumed by us as a result of certain acquisitions, of $8.2 million.

On
June 27, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement to replace the IMI revolving credit facility and the IMI term loan facility, each entered into on April 16, 2007.
The new credit agreement consists of (i) revolving credit facilities under which we can borrow, subject to certain limitations as defined in the new credit agreement, up to an aggregate amount
of $725.0 million (including Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling and Euros, among other currencies) (the "New Revolving Credit Facility") and (ii) a $500.0 million term loan
facility (the "New Term Loan Facility," and collectively with the New Revolving Credit Facility, the "New Credit Agreement"). We have the right to increase the aggregate amount available to be
borrowed under the New Credit Agreement up to a maximum of $1.8 billion. The New Revolving Credit Facility is supported by a group of 19 banks. IMI, Iron Mountain Information
Management, Inc. ("IMIM"), Canada Company, IME, Iron Mountain Australia Pty Ltd., Iron Mountain Switzerland Gmbh and any other subsidiary of IMIM designated by IMIM



(the "Other
Subsidiaries") may, with the consent of the administrative agent, as defined in the New Credit Agreement, borrow under certain of the following tranches of the New Revolving Credit
Facility: (a) tranche one in the amount of $400.0 million is available to IMI and IMIM in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling and Euros, (b) tranche two in the amount of
$150.0 million is available to IMI or IMIM in either U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars and available to Canada Company in Canadian dollars and (c) tranche three in the amount of
$175.0 million is available to IMI or IMIM and the Other Subsidiaries in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, Euros and Australian dollars, among others. The New
Revolving Credit Facility terminates on June 27, 2016, at which point all revolving credit loans under such facility become due. With respect to the New Term Loan Facility, loan payments are
required through maturity on June 27, 2016 in equal quarterly installments of the aggregate annual amounts based upon the following percentage of the original principal amount in the table
below (except that each of the first three quarterly installments in the fifth year shall be 10% of the original principal amount and the final quarterly installment in the fifth year shall be 35% of
the original principal):

The
New Term Loan Facility may be prepaid without penalty or premium, in whole or in part, at any time. IMI and IMIM guarantee the obligations of each of the subsidiary borrowers. The
capital stock or other equity interests of most of the U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first-tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged
to secure the New Credit Agreement, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors. The interest rate on borrowings under the
New Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin, which varies based on certain financial ratios. Additionally, the New Credit
Agreement requires the payment of a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, which fee ranges from between 0.3% to 0.5% based on certain financial ratios, as well as fees
associated with any outstanding letters of credit. Proceeds from the New Credit Agreement are for general corporate purposes and were used to repay the previous revolving credit and term loan
facilities. We recorded a charge of $1.8 million to other expense (income), net in the second quarter of 2011 related to the early retirement of the previous revolving credit and term loan
facilities, representing a write-off of deferred financings costs. As of December 31, 2011, we had $96.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the New Revolving Credit
Facility, all of which was denominated in U.S. dollars; we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $5.8 million. The remaining availability on December 31, 2011, based on
IMI's leverage ratio, which is calculated based on the last 12 months' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), and other adjustments as defined in the New
Credit Agreement and current external debt, under the New Revolving Credit
Facility was $623.2 million. The interest rate in effect under the New Revolving Credit Facility and New Term Loan Facility was 4.0% and 2.3%, respectively, as of December 31,
2011.

The
New Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict
our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger.
Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the New Credit Agreement, our indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness. The New Credit Agreement, as well as
our indentures, use EBITDA-based calculations as primary measures of financial performance, including leverage and fixed



charge
coverage ratios. IMI's revolving credit and term leverage ratio was 2.9 and 3.4 as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 5.5. Similarly,
our bond leverage ratio, per the indentures, was 3.4 and 3.9 as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5. IMI's revolving credit and term loan
fixed charge coverage ratio was 1.5 as of December 31, 2011, compared to a minimum allowable ratio of 1.2. Noncompliance with these leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios would have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.

Our
ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic,
financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or
that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to make necessary capital expenditures.

In
January 2011, we redeemed the remaining $231.3 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 7


/


% Notes due 2015 at a redemption price of one thousand
dollars for each one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a gain to other expense (income), net of approximately $0.9 million in
the first quarter of 2011 related to the early extinguishment of our 7


/


% Notes due 2015 that were redeemed. This gain consists of original issue premiums, net of deferred financing
costs related to our 7


/


% Notes due 2015 that were redeemed.

On
June 2, 2011, we completed the sale of the Digital Business to Autonomy. Pursuant to the Digital Sale Agreement, we received approximately $395.4 million in cash,
consisting of the initial purchase price of $380.0 million and a preliminary working capital adjustment of approximately $15.4 million, which remains subject to a customary
post-closing adjustment based on the amount of working capital at closing. The purchase price for the Digital Sale will be increased on a
dollar-for-dollar basis if the working capital balance at the time of closing exceeds the target amount of working capital as set forth in the Digital Sale Agreement and
decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis if such closing working capital balance is less than the target amount. We and Autonomy are in disagreement regarding the working capital
adjustment in the Digital Sale Agreement. As a result, as contemplated by the Digital Sale Agreement, the matter is being referred to an independent third party accounting firm for determination of
the appropriate adjustment. Transaction costs related to the Digital Sale amounted to approximately $7.4 million. Additionally, $11.1 million of inducements are payable to Autonomy and
have been netted against the proceeds in calculating the gain on the Digital Sale. We used the net proceeds received from the Digital Sale to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit
facility and used $52.4 million of the net proceeds to fund cash taxes due as a result of the Digital Sale.

In
September 2011, we completed an underwritten public offering of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7


/


% Notes due 2019, which were issued at
100% of par. Our net proceeds of $394.0 million after paying the underwriters' discounts and commissions, were used for general corporate purposes, including funding a portion of the
stockholder payout commitments we have made.

Amounts
are offset by sublease income of $10.6 million in total (including $2.3 million, $3.6 million, $2.8 million and
$1.9 million, in less than 1 year, 1–3 years, 3–5 years and more than 5 years, respectively).

Includes
aggregate amounts related to our Italian Business of $2.6 million, $3.7 million, $3.5 million, $8.2 million
($18.0 million in total) in less than 1 year, 1–3 years, 3–5 years and more than 5 years, respectively.

(4)

In
connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn-out obligations that may be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet
certain financial objectives. These payments are based on the future results of these operations, and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn-out payments we may be required to make
under all such agreements as of December 31, 2011 is approximately $4.5 million.

(5)

The
table above excludes $31.4 million in uncertain tax positions as we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash
settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.

We
expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, borrowings under the New Credit Agreement
and other financings, which may include secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. We expect to meet our long-term cash flow requirements using
the same means described above, as well as the potential issuance of debt or equity securities as we deem appropriate.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4)(ii).

Net Operating Losses and Foreign Tax Credit Carryforwards

We have federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2020 through 2025 of $28.2 million
($9.9 million, tax effected) at December 31, 2011 to reduce future federal taxable income. We have an asset for state net operating losses of $7.9 million (net of federal tax
benefit), which begins



to
expire in 2012 through 2025, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 99%. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $40.3 million, with various expiration dates, subject
to a valuation allowance of approximately 69%. We also have foreign tax credits of $56.6 million, which begin to expire in 2014 through 2019, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately
65%. U.S. legislative changes in 2010 reduced the expected utilization of foreign tax credits which resulted in the requirement for a valuation allowance.

Inflation

Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to
normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long-term
real estate leases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Market Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money
market funds and time deposits), restricted cash (primarily U.S. Treasuries) and accounts receivable. The only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of December 31, 2011 relate to
cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash held on deposit with five global banks and one "Triple A" rated money market fund which we consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade
institutions. As per our risk management investment policy, we limit exposure to concentration of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund or financial institution to a
maximum of $50.0 million. As of December 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was $215.0 million, including a money market fund and time
deposits amounting to $181.8 million. A substantial portion of the money market fund is invested in U.S. Treasuries.

Interest Rate Risk

Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long-term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the
preference to use long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long-term returns on invested capital. We target approximately
75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. See Notes 3 and
4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As
of December 31, 2011, we had $586.7 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of approximately 2.6%, and
$2,766.9 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 82.5% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. If the weighted average variable interest
rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have been reduced by approximately $3.4 million. See Note 4 to Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2011.

Currency Risk

Our investments in IME, Canada Company, Iron Mountain Mexico, SA de RL de CV, Iron Mountain South America, Ltd., Iron
Mountain Australia Pty Ltd. and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the
U.S. dollar. However, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the Euro, Canadian dollar



and
British pound sterling. Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and
dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency.

The
impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. We
also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and IMI and our U.S.-based subsidiaries. In addition, Iron Mountain Switzerland GmbH, our foreign subsidiaries
and IME also have intercompany obligations between them. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary.

We
have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. One strategy is to finance certain of our international
subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. In determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies, among
other factors. Another strategy we utilize is for IMI or IMIM to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. In addition, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to
temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition, to lock in certain transaction economics. We have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the
United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Canada. Specifically, through our 150.0 million British pounds sterling denominated 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 and our
255.0 million 6


/


% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in British pounds sterling and Euros.
Canada Company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in Canadian dollars under the Credit Agreement and its 175.0 million CAD denominated 7


/


% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2017. This creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. In the third quarter of 2007, we designated a portion of our 6


/


% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due
2018 issued by IMI as a hedge of net investment of certain of our Euro denominated subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded $8.6 million ($5.4 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange
gains related to the "marking-to-market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in equity
for the year ended December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, net gains of $13.4 million are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net
investment hedge.

We
have also entered into a number of separate forward contracts to hedge our exposures to British pounds sterling and Australian dollars. As of December 31, 2011, we had an
outstanding forward contract to purchase $195.6 million U.S. dollars and sell 125.0 million British pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with IME. As of
December 31, 2011, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase $75.1 million U.S. dollars and sell 73.0 million Australian dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with
our Australian subsidiary. At the maturity of the forward contracts, we may enter into new forward contracts to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. At the time of settlement, we either pay
or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain
or loss. We have not designated these forward contracts as hedges.
At the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation.
During the year ended December 31, 2011, there was $1.1 million in net cash disbursements included in cash from operating activities from continuing operations related to settlements
associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. We recorded net gains in connection with these forward contracts of $1.2 million (including an unrealized foreign exchange gain of
$2.0 million related to certain British pound sterling forward contracts and an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $0.8 million related to the Australian dollar forward contract offset
by an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $0.4 million related to a British pound sterling forward contract) in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of



operations
as of December 31, 2011, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are not hedged.

The
impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses.
Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect
of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items, net" component of equity. A 10% depreciation in
year-end 2011 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $79.8 million.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The information required by this item is included in Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The term "disclosure controls and procedures" is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act. These rules refer to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information is recorded, processed, summarized and communicated to management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding what is required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under
the Exchange Act. As of December 31, 2011 (the "Evaluation Date"), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer
concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness in our internal control over identification and monitoring of price
reduction clauses in certain U.S. government customer contracts as described below.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Due to their inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31,
2011 because of the material weakness described below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or



detected
on a timely basis. In our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2011, we identified the following material weakness:

We
did not maintain adequate and effective internal control in the area of identifying and monitoring price reduction clauses in certain U.S. government customer contracts. In 2011, we
discovered, in conjunction with a government contract renewal, as more fully discussed in Note 10.h. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, that we did not have a control in place to
appropriately identify and monitor price reduction clauses of certain U.S. government customer contracts. The material weakness contributed to management's conclusion that an immaterial restatement of
our consolidated financial statements was appropriate, as more fully discussed in Note 2.y. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Total revenue under U.S. government contracts for the
year ended December 31, 2011 was less than $75 million.

Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

To address the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described above, we performed additional analyses and
other post-closing procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. As a result of these procedures, we
believe that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011 fairly present, in all material
respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow for the periods presented, in conformity with GAAP. We will continue to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make necessary
improvements to our internal control over financial reporting including:

•

Hiring a government contract compliance specialist.

•

Developing and implementing a process to appropriately identify government contracts with price reduction clauses.

•

Developing and implementing procedures to track and monitor benchmark pricing and calculating any related price reductions
under these contracts.

We
have begun our remediation efforts and we expect these efforts, which include design, implementation and testing, to continue throughout fiscal year 2012. We believe that the
remediation measures described above will strengthen our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the material weakness we have identified. We are committed to continuing to improve our
internal control processes and will continue to diligently review our financial controls and procedures.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Iron Mountain Incorporated

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Iron Mountain Incorporated and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on that risk, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management's
assessment: the Company did not maintain adequate and effective internal control in the area of identifying and monitoring price reduction clauses in certain U.S. government customer contracts. This
material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2011 and this report does not affect our report on such financial statements.



In
our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness identified above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2011 of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Iron Mountain Incorporated

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Iron Mountain Incorporated and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Iron Mountain Incorporated and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2012 expressed an adverse opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting because of a material
weakness.

IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2011

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

1. Nature of Business

The accompanying financial statements represent the consolidated accounts of Iron Mountain Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("IMI"), and its subsidiaries. We are a global
full-service provider of information management and related services for all media in various locations throughout North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. We have a
diversified customer base comprised of commercial, legal, banking, health care, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations.

In
August 2010, IMI divested the domain name management product line of our digital business (the "Domain Name Product Line"). On June 2, 2011, IMI completed the sale (the
"Digital Sale") of our online backup and recovery, digital archiving and eDiscovery solutions businesses of our digital business (the "Digital Business") to Autonomy Corporation plc, a
corporation formed under the laws of England and Wales ("Autonomy"), pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement dated as of May 15, 2011 among IMI, certain subsidiaries of IMI and Autonomy (the
"Digital Sale Agreement"). The financial position, operating results and cash flows of the Domain Name Product Line and the Digital Business, for all periods presented, including the gains on the
sales, have been reported as discontinued operations for
financial reporting purposes. Additionally, on October 3, 2011, we sold our records management business in New Zealand (the "New Zealand Business"), and in December 2011, we committed to a plan
to sell our records management business in Italy (the "Italian Business"). The financial position, operating results and cash flows of the New Zealand and Italian Businesses, including the gain on the
sale of the New Zealand Business, for all periods presented, have been reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes. See Note 14 for a further discussion of these
events.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

a.

Principles
of Consolidation and Change in Accounting Principle

The
accompanying financial statements reflect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows on a consolidated basis. Prior to January 1, 2010, the financial
position and results of operations of the operating subsidiaries of Iron Mountain Europe (Group) Limited (collectively referred to as "IME"), our European business, were consolidated based on IME's
fiscal year ended October 31. Effective January 1, 2010, we changed the fiscal year-end (and the reporting period for consolidation purposes) of IME to coincide with IMI's
fiscal year-end of December 31. We believe that the change in accounting principle related to the elimination of the two-month reporting lag for IME is preferable
because it results in more contemporaneous reporting of events and results related to IME. In accordance with applicable accounting literature, a change in subsidiary year-end is treated
as a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application. The impact of the change was not material to the results of operations for the previously reported annual and interim
periods prior to January 1, 2010, and, thus, those results have not been revised. There is, however, a charge of $4,711 recorded to other expense (income), net in the year ended
December 31, 2010 to recognize the immaterial difference arising from the change. Had the annual financial statements been revised, operating income (loss), income (loss) from continuing
operations before provision (benefit) for income taxes and net
income (loss) attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated in calendar 2009 would have been increased by $3,714, $7,041 and $4,957, respectively. In addition, revenue, operating income (loss),

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

income
(loss) from continuing operations before provision (benefit) for income taxes and net income (loss) attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated for the year ended December 31, 2010 would
not have changed materially had we not eliminated the two-month reporting lag. There were no significant, infrequent or unusual items in the IME two-month period ended
December 31, 2009. All intercompany account balances have been eliminated.

b.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires us to make estimates, judgments and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for
the period then ended. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the estimates used. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that
we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

c.

Cash,
Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on hand and cash invested in short-term securities, which have remaining maturities at the date of purchase of less than
90 days. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

We
have restricted cash associated with a collateral trust agreement with our insurance carrier that was entered into in 2010 related to our worker's compensation
self-insurance program. The restricted cash subject to this agreement was $35,105 and $35,110 as of December 31, 2010 and 2011,
respectively, and is included in current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash consists primarily of U.S. Treasuries.

d.

Foreign
Currency

Local
currencies are considered the functional currencies for our operations outside the U.S., with the exception of certain foreign holding companies and our financing center in
Switzerland, whose functional currencies are the U.S. dollar. In those instances where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated at period-end
exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the applicable period. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive
items, net component of Iron Mountain Incorporated Stockholders' Equity and Noncontrolling Interests. The gain or loss on foreign currency transactions, calculated as the difference between the
historical exchange rate and the exchange rate at the applicable measurement date, including those related to (a) our 7

on our consolidated statements of operations. The total gain or loss on foreign currency transactions amounted

to
a net gain of $12,845, a net loss of $5,664 and a net loss of $17,352 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

e.

Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

Every
derivative instrument is required to be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value. Periodically, we acquire derivative instruments
that are intended to hedge either cash flows or values which are subject to foreign exchange or other market price risk and not for trading purposes. We have formally documented our hedging
relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking each hedge transaction. Given the
recurring nature of our revenues and the long-term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long-term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our
business, thereby
preserving our long-term returns on invested capital. We target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we may use interest rate
swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. In addition, we may use borrowings in foreign currencies, either obtained in the U.S. or by our foreign subsidiaries, to hedge
foreign currency risk associated with our international investments. Sometimes we enter into currency swaps to temporarily hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition, while we arrange
permanent financing or to hedge our exposure due to foreign currency exchange movements related to our intercompany accounts with and between our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2010
and 2011, none of our derivative instruments contained credit-risk related contingent features.

Minor
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Major improvements which extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or the efficiency of property owned are
capitalized. Major improvements to leased buildings are capitalized as leasehold improvements and depreciated.

We
develop various software applications for internal use. Computer software costs associated with internal use software are expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria
are met. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects (to the extent time is spent
directly on the project) are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is
probable that the application will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are
periodically evaluated for impairment. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2011, we wrote-off $600 (primarily in Corporate) and $3,500 (approximately $3,050 associated with
our International Business segment and approximately $450 associated with our North American Business segment), respectively, of previously deferred software costs associated with internal use
software development projects that were discontinued after implementation, which resulted in a loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations.

Entities
are required to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. Asset retirement obligations represent the costs
to replace or remove tangible long-lived assets required by law, regulatory rule or contractual agreement. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost by
increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset, which is then depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The liability is increased over time through income
such that the liability will equate to the future cost to retire the long-lived asset at the expected retirement date. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the
obligation for its recorded amount or realizes a gain or loss upon settlement. Our obligations are primarily the result of requirements under our facility lease agreements which generally have "return

original
condition" clauses which would require us to remove or restore items such as shred pits, vaults, demising walls and office build-outs, among others. The significant assumptions
used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are the timing of removals, the probability of a requirement to perform, estimated cost and associated expected inflation rates that are
consistent with historical rates and credit-adjusted risk-free rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate.

A
reconciliation of liabilities for asset retirement obligations (included in other long-term liabilities) is as follows:

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Other than goodwill, we
currently have no intangible assets that have indefinite lives and which are not amortized. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives are amortized over their useful
lives. We periodically assess whether events or circumstances warrant a change in the life over which our intangible assets are amortized.

We
have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and noted
no impairment of goodwill. However, as a result of interim triggering events as discussed below, we recorded provisional goodwill impairment charges in each of the third quarters of 2010 and 2011 in
conjunction with the Digital Sale and associated with our Western European operations, respectively. These provisional goodwill impairment charges were finalized in the fourth quarters of the 2010 and
2011 fiscal years, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, no factors were identified that would alter our October 1, 2011 goodwill assessment. In making this assessment, we relied on a
number of factors including operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our
judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based
on their relative fair values.

As
discussed at Note 14, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge in 2010 associated with our former worldwide digital business reporting unit. For the year ended
December 31, 2010, we allocated $85,909 of this charge to the technology escrow services business based on a relative fair value basis.



IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2011

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

This
charge continues to be included in our continuing results of operations as a component of intangible impairments in our consolidated statements of operations as we retained this business
following the Digital Sale. Our technology escrow services business had previously been reported in the former worldwide digital business segment and is now reported in the North American Business
segment.

In
September 2011, as a result of certain changes we made in the manner in which our European operations are managed, we reorganized our reporting structure and reassigned goodwill among
the revised reporting units. Previously, we tested goodwill impairment at the European level on a combined basis. As a result of the management and reporting changes, we concluded that we have three
reporting units for our European operations: (1) the United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway ("UKI"); (2) Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain ("Western Europe"); and
(3) the remaining countries in Europe ("Central Europe"). Due to these changes, we will perform all future goodwill impairment analysis on the new reporting unit basis. As a result of the
restructuring of our reporting units, we concluded that we had an interim triggering event, and, therefore, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test for UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe
in the third quarter of 2011 as of August 31, 2011. As required by GAAP, prior to our goodwill impairment analysis, we performed an impairment assessment on the long-lived assets
within our UKI, Western Europe and Central Europe reporting units and noted no impairment, except for the Italian Business, which was included in our Western Europe reporting unit, and which is now
included in discontinued operations as discussed in Note 14. Based on our analyses, we concluded that the goodwill of our UKI and Central Europe reporting units was not impaired. Our UKI and
Central Europe reporting units had fair values that exceed their carrying values by 15.1% and 4.9%, respectively, as of August 31, 2011. Central Europe is still in the investment stage and
accordingly its fair value does not exceed its carrying value by a significant margin at this point in time. A deterioration of the UKI or Central Europe businesses or their failure to achieve the
forecasted results could lead to impairments in future periods. Our Western Europe reporting unit's fair value was less than its carrying value, and, as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment
charge of $46,500 included as a component of intangible impairments from continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011. A tax benefit
of approximately $5,449 was recorded associated with the Western Europe goodwill impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2011 and is included in the provision (benefit) for income
taxes from continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. See Note 14 for the portion of the charge allocated to the Italian Business based on a relative fair
value basis.

Our
reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2010 were as follows: North America; Europe; Latin America; Australia; Joint
Ventures (which includes India, the various joint ventures in Southeast Asia and Russia (referred to as "Joint Ventures")); and Business Process Management ("BPM"). Given their similar economic
characteristics, products, customers and processes, (1) the United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway and (2) the countries of Continental Europe (excluding Joint Ventures), each a reporting
unit, have been aggregated as Europe and tested as one for goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of goodwill, net amounted to $1,750,420, $438,344, $29,787 and
$61,010 for North America, Europe, Latin America and Australia, respectively. Our Joint Ventures and BPM reporting units had no goodwill as of

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2011

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

December 31,
2010. Our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2011 were as follows: North America; UKI; Western Europe; Central
Europe; Latin America; Australia; and Joint Ventures. As of December 31, 2011, the carrying value of goodwill, net amounted to $1,748,879, $306,150, $46,439, $63,781, $27,322, and $61,697 for
North America, UKI,
Western Europe, Central Europe, Latin America and Australia, respectively. Our Joint Ventures reporting unit has no goodwill as of December 31, 2011. Our North America, Latin America and
Australia reporting units had estimated fair values as of October 1, 2011 that exceeded their carrying values by greater than 40%.

Reporting
unit valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit or a combined approach based on the present
value of future cash flows and market and transaction multiples of revenues and earnings. The income approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected
capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. In conjunction with our
annual goodwill impairment reviews, we reconcile the sum of the valuations of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of such dates.

Long-Lived
Assets

We
review long-lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may
not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The
operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets,
then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long-lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised
values, depending upon the nature of the assets.

Consolidated
loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net of $168 in the year ended December 31, 2009 consisted primarily of a gain on disposal of
a building in our International Business segment of approximately $1,900 in France, offset by losses on the write-down of certain facilities of approximately $1,000 in our North American
Business segment, $700 in our International Business segment and $300 in Corporate (associated with discontinued products after implementation). Consolidated gain on disposal/write-down of
property, plant and equipment, net of $10,987 in the year ended December 31, 2010 consisted primarily of a gain of approximately $10,200 as a result of the settlement with our insurers in
connection with a portion of the property component of our claim related to the Chilean earthquake in the third and fourth quarter of 2010, gains of approximately $3,200 in North America primarily
related to the disposition of certain owned equipment and a gain on disposal of a building in our International Business segment of approximately $1,300 in the United Kingdom, offset by approximately
$1,000 of asset write-downs associated with our Latin American operations and approximately $2,600 of impairment losses primarily related to certain owned facilities in North America. Consolidated
gain on
disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net of $2,286 in the year ended December 31, 2011 consisted primarily of a gain of approximately $3,200 related to the
disposition of a facility in Canada and a gain of approximately $3,000 on the retirement of leased vehicles accounted for as capital lease assets associated with our North American Business segment,
offset by a loss associated with discontinued use of certain third-party software licenses of approximately $3,500 (approximately $3,050 associated with our International Business segment and
approximately $450 associated with our North American Business segment).

i.

Customer
Relationships and Acquisition Costs and Other Intangible Assets

Costs
related to the acquisition of large volume accounts are capitalized. Initial costs incurred to transport the boxes to one of our facilities, which includes labor and transportation
charges, are amortized over periods ranging from one to 30 years (weighted average of 25 years at December 31, 2011), and are included in depreciation and amortization in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Payments to a customer's current records management vendor or direct payments to a customer are amortized over periods ranging from one to
10 years (weighted average of four years at December 31, 2011) to the storage and service revenue line items in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. If the customer
terminates its relationship with us, the unamortized cost is charged to expense or revenue. However, in the event of such termination, we generally collect, and record as income, permanent removal
fees that generally equal or exceed the amount of the

unamortized
costs. Customer relationship intangible assets acquired through business combinations, which represents the majority of the balance, are amortized over periods ranging from 10 to
30 years (weighted average of 19 years at December 31, 2011). Amounts allocated in purchase accounting to customer relationship intangible assets are calculated based upon
estimates of their fair value utilizing an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. Other intangible assets, including noncompetition agreements, acquired core technology and
trademarks, are capitalized and amortized over periods ranging from two to 10 years (weighted average of seven years at December 31, 2011).

Deferred
Financing Costs

Deferred
financing costs are amortized over the life of the related debt using the effective interest rate method. If debt is retired early, the related unamortized deferred financing
costs are written off in the period the debt is retired to other expense (income), net. As of December 31, 2010 and 2011, gross carrying amount of deferred financing costs was $50,242 and
$54,826, respectively, and accumulated amortization of those costs was $21,096 and $19,028, respectively, and was recorded in other assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Revenues

Our
revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance
indicator for the information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic charges related to the
storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis). Service revenues are comprised of charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services.
Included in core service revenues are: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records and the
destruction of records; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and
(4) other recurring services, including hybrid services and recurring project revenues. Our complementary services revenues include special project work, customer termination and permanent
withdrawal fees, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology services and product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies). Our
secure shredding revenues include the sale of recycled paper (included in complementary services revenues), the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility and
reducing the predictability of that revenue stream.

We
recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month

the
respective storage or service is provided, and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid
service contracts for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when
the service is performed. Revenue from the sales of products, which is included as a component of service revenues, is recognized when products are shipped to the customer and title has passed to the
customer. Revenues from the sales of products have historically not been significant.

m.

Rent
Normalization

We
have entered into various leases for buildings that expire over various terms. Certain leases have fixed escalation clauses (excluding those tied to the consumer price index or other
inflation-based indices) or other features (including return to original condition, primarily in the United Kingdom) which require normalization of the rental expense over the life of the lease
resulting in deferred rent being reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we have assumed various above and below market leases in connection with certain of our
acquisitions. The difference between the present value of these lease obligations and the market rate at the date of the acquisition was recorded as a deferred rent liability or other
long-term asset and is being amortized over the remaining lives of the respective leases.

n.

Stock-Based
Compensation

We
record stock-based compensation expense, utilizing the straight-line method, for the cost of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and
shares of stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan (together, "Employee Stock-Based Awards").

Stock-based
compensation expense for Employee Stock-Based Awards included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and
2011 was $18,703, including $3,493 in discontinued operations, ($14,716 after tax or $0.07 per basic and diluted share), $20,378, including $3,104 in discontinued operations, ($15,672 after tax or
$0.08 per basic and diluted share) and $17,510, including $260 in discontinued operations, ($8,834 after tax or $0.05 per basic and diluted share), respectively.

included $5,532, $2,252 and $919 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively, from the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost.
The tax benefit of any resulting excess tax deduction increases the Additional Paid-in Capital ("APIC") pool. Any resulting tax deficiency is deducted from the APIC pool.

Stock Options

Under our various stock option plans, options were granted with exercise prices equal to the market price of the stock on the date of
grant. The majority of our options become exercisable ratably over a period of five years and generally have a contractual life of ten years, unless the holder's employment is sooner terminated.
Certain of the options we issue become exercisable ratably over a period of ten years and have a contractual life of 12 years, unless the holder's employment is sooner terminated. As of
December 31, 2011, ten-year vesting options represented 7.3% of total outstanding options. Beginning in 2011, certain of the options we issue become exercisable ratably over a
period of three years and have a contractual life of ten years, unless the holder's employment is sooner terminated. As of December 31, 2011, three-year vesting options represented
11.0% of total outstanding options. Our non-employee directors are considered employees for purposes of our stock option plans and stock option reporting. Options granted to our
non-employee directors generally become exercisable after one year.

In
December 2008, we amended each of the Iron Mountain Incorporated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, the Iron Mountain Incorporated 1997 Stock Option Plan, the LiveVault Corporation 2001 Stock
Incentive Plan and the Stratify, Inc. 1999 Stock Plan (each a "Plan" and, collectively, the "Plans") to provide that any unvested options and other awards granted under each respective Plan
shall vest immediately should an employee be terminated by the Company, or terminate his or her own employment for good reason (as defined in each Plan), in connection with a vesting change in control
(as defined in each Plan). The Mimosa Systems, Inc. 2009 Equity Incentive Plan and the Mimosa Systems, Inc. 2003 Stock Plan were similarly amended in June 2010.

A
total of 37,536,442 shares of common stock have been reserved for grants of options and other rights under our various stock incentive plans. The number of shares available for grant
at December 31, 2011 was 7,112,835.

The
weighted average fair value of options granted in 2009, 2010 and 2011 was $9.72, $7.71 and $7.42 per share, respectively. These values were estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following table summarizes the weighted average assumptions used for grants in the year ended December 31:

Expected
volatility is calculated utilizing daily historical volatility over a period that equates to the expected life of the option. The risk-free interest rate was based
on the U.S. Treasury interest rates whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options. Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, expected dividend yield was considered in the option
pricing model as a result of our new dividend program. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) of the stock options granted is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of
employees.

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units

Under our various stock option plans, we may also issue grants of restricted stock or restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Our restricted
stock and RSUs generally have a three to five year vesting period. The fair value of restricted stock and RSUs is the excess of the market price of our common stock at the date of grant over the
purchase price (which is typically zero).

total fair value of RSUs vested for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $931.

Performance Units

Under our various stock option plans, we may also issue grants of performance units ("PUs"). The number of PUs earned will be
determined based on our performance against predefined targets, which for 2011 were calendar year revenue growth and return on invested capital ("ROIC"). The range of payout is zero to 150% of the
number of granted PUs. The number of PUs earned will be determined based on actual performance at the end of the one-year performance period, and the award will be settled in shares of our
common stock, subject to cliff vesting, three years from the date of the original PU grant. Additionally, employees who are employed through the one-year anniversary of the date of grant
and who reach both 55 years of age and 10 years of qualifying service (the "retirement criteria") shall immediately and completely vest in any PUs earned based on the actual achievement
against the predefined targets as discussed above. As a result, PUs will be expensed over the shorter of (a) achievement of the retirement criteria, which such achievement may occur as early as
one year after the date of grant, or (b) a maximum of three years.

In
2011, we issued 154,239 PUs. During the one-year performance period, we will forecast the likelihood of achieving the annual revenue growth and ROIC predefined targets in
order to calculate the expected PUs to be earned. We will record a compensation charge based on either the forecasted PUs to be earned (during the one-year performance period) or the
actual PUs earned (at the one-year anniversary date) over the vesting period for each individual grant as described above. The performance unit liability is remeasured at each fiscal
quarter-end during the vesting period using the estimated percentage of units earned multiplied by the closing market price of our common stock on the current period-end date
and is pro-rated based on the amount of time passed in the vesting period. As of December 31, 2011, we expected 99.6% achievement of the predefined revenue and ROIC targets
associated with the grants made in 2011 and the closing market price of our common stock was $30.80.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We offer an employee stock purchase plan (the "ESPP") in which participation is available to substantially all U.S. and Canadian
employees who meet certain service eligibility requirements. The ESPP provides a way for our eligible employees to become stockholders on favorable terms. The ESPP provides for the purchase of our
common stock by eligible employees through successive offering periods. We generally have two six-month offering periods per year, the first of which begins June 1 and ends
November 30 and the second of which begins December 1 and ends May 31. During each offering period, participating employees accumulate after-tax payroll contributions,
up to a maximum of 15% of their compensation, to pay the exercise price of their options. Participating employees may withdraw from an offering period before the purchase date and obtain a refund of
the amounts withheld as payroll deductions. At the end of the offering period, outstanding options are exercised, and each employee's accumulated contributions are used to purchase our common stock.
The price for shares purchased under the ESPP is 95% of the fair market price at the end of the offering period, without a look-back feature. As a result, we do not recognize compensation
cost for the ESPP shares purchased. The ESPP was amended and approved by our stockholders on May 26, 2005 and the number of shares available for purchase under the ESPP was increased to
3,487,500. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, there were 258,680 shares, 257,381 shares and 154,559 shares, respectively, purchased under the ESPP. The number of shares
available for purchase under the ESPP at December 31, 2011 was 399,761.

As
of December 31, 2011, unrecognized compensation cost related to the unvested portion of our Employee Stock-Based Awards was $40,454 and is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 2.9 years.

We
generally issue shares for the exercises of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, PUs and shares under our ESPP from unissued reserved shares.

Income
Taxes

Accounting
for income taxes requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and
financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when recovery of deferred tax assets is not considered more likely than
not. We have elected to recognize

Income
(Loss) Per Share—Basic and Diluted

Basic
income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The calculation of diluted income (loss) per
share is consistent with that of basic income (loss) per share but gives effect to all potential common shares (that is,
securities such as options, warrants or convertible securities) that were outstanding during the period, unless the effect is antidilutive.

New
Accounting Pronouncements

In
September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2011-08,

Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment

.
ASU 2011-08 allows but does not require entities to
first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative two-step impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required.
ASU 2011-08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The adoption
of this ASU 2011-08 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memo Reserves

We
maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments and potential
disputes regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables and credit memo activity, current
economic conditions and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or
impairment of their ability to make
payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. We consider accounts receivable to be delinquent after such time as reasonable means of collection have been exhausted. We
charge-off uncollectible balances as circumstances warrant, generally, no later than one year past due.

Financial
instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits), restricted cash
(primarily U.S. Treasuries) and accounts receivable. The only significant concentrations of liquid investments as of December 31, 2011 relate to cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash
held on deposit with five global banks and one "Triple A" rated money market fund which we consider to be large, highly-rated investment-grade institutions. As per our risk management investment
policy, we limit exposure to

of credit risk by limiting the amount invested in any one mutual fund or financial institution to a maximum of $50,000. As of December 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalent and
restricted cash balance was $214,955, including a money market fund and time deposits amounting to $181,823. A substantial portion of the money market fund is invested in U.S. Treasuries.

Fair
Value Measurements

Entities
are permitted under GAAP to elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at either fair value or cost. We did not elect the fair value measurement option
for any of our financial assets or liabilities.

Our
financial assets or liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. A financial asset or liability's classification within the hierarchy is
determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

Level 1—Inputs
are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.

Level 2—Inputs
include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that
are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or
corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).

Level 3—Unobservable
inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

The
following tables provide the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively:

Money
market funds and time deposits (including certain trading securities) are measured based on quoted prices for similar assets and/or subsequent
transactions.

(2)

Securities
are measured at fair value using quoted market prices.

(3)

Our
derivative assets and liabilities primarily relate to short-term (six months or less) foreign currency contracts that we have entered into
to hedge our intercompany exposures denominated in British pounds sterling and Australian dollars. We calculate the fair value of such forward contracts by adjusting the spot rate utilized at the
balance sheet date for translation purposes by an estimate of the forward points observed in active markets.

Disclosures
are required in the financial statements for items measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. We did not have any material items that are measured at fair
value on a non-recurring basis for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011, except goodwill calculated based on Level 3 inputs, as more fully disclosed at Note 2.g.

Available-for-sale
and Trading Securities

We
have one trust that holds marketable securities. Marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale or trading. As of December 31, 2010 and
2011, the fair value of the money market and mutual funds included in this trust amounted to $9,215 and $9,124, respectively, and were included in prepaid expenses and other in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. We classified these marketable securities included in the trust as trading, and included in other expense (income), net in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations realized and unrealized net gains of $1,745, $1,221 and net losses of $321 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

Investments

As
of December 31, 2011, we have investments in joint ventures, including noncontrolling interests, in Iron Mountain A/S of 20% (Denmark), in Iron Mountain Arsivleme Hizmetleri
A.S. of 40% (Turkey), in Sispace AG of 15% (Switzerland) and in Kelman Technologies Inc. of 25% (U.S. and Canada). These investments are accounted for using the equity method because we
exercise significant influence over these entities and their operations. As of December 31, 2010 and 2011, the carrying value related to our equity investments was $9,663 and $3,499,
respectively, included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Immaterial
Restatement

Subsequent
to the issuance of the Company's 2010 financial statements, the Company's management identified a government contract billing error more fully discussed at Note 10.h.,
which resulted in an overstatement of prior years reported revenue by an amount currently estimated to be approximately $17,000 in the aggregate. While no prior period financial statement was
materially misstated, we have determined that the cumulative impact of recording this adjustment would have significantly distorted our results for the year ended December 31, 2011. As a
result, we have restated beginning retained earnings as of December 31, 2008 for the cumulative impact of activity prior to December 31, 2008 in the amount of $3,784. Additionally, we
have restated our 2009 and 2010 consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of equity and our 2010 consolidated balance sheet to reflect the
impact in those particular years. There was no change to the following lines of the 2009 and 2010 consolidated statements of cash flows: (1) cash flows from operating activities,
(2) cash flows from investing activities and (3) cash flows from financing activities.

3. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We have entered into a number of separate forward contracts to hedge our exposures in British pounds sterling and Australian dollars. As of December 31, 2011, we had an
outstanding forward contract to purchase $195,610 U.S. dollars and sell 125,000 British pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with IME. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we entered into a
forward contract to hedge our exposures in Australian dollars. As of December 31, 2011, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase $75,065 U.S. dollars and sell 73,000 Australian
dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with our Australian subsidiary. At the maturity of the forward contracts, we may enter into new forward contracts to hedge movements in the underlying
currencies. At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other (income) expense, net in the accompanying
statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. At the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or
loss for the mark-to-market valuation. We have not designated these forward contracts as hedges. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, there was
$2,392 in net cash disbursements, $2,030 in net cash receipts and $1,092 in net cash disbursements, respectively, included in cash from operating activities from continuing operations related to
settlements associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. The following table provides the fair value of our derivative instruments as of December 31, 2010 and 2011 and their gains

Revolving
Credit Facility and Term Loans

On
June 27, 2011, we entered into a new credit agreement to replace the IMI revolving credit facility and the IMI term loan facility, each entered into on April 16, 2007.
The new credit agreement consists of (i) revolving credit facilities under which we can borrow, subject to certain limitations as defined in the new credit agreement, up to an aggregate amount
of $725,000 (including Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling and Euros, among other currencies) (the "New Revolving Credit Facility") and (ii) a $500,000 term loan facility (the "New Term
Loan Facility," and collectively with the New Revolving Credit Facility, the "New Credit Agreement"). We have the right to increase the aggregate amount available to be borrowed under the New Credit
Agreement up to a maximum of $1,800,000. The New Revolving Credit Facility is supported by a group of 19 banks. IMI, Iron Mountain Information Management, Inc. ("IMIM"), Canada Company, IME,
Iron Mountain Australia Pty Ltd., Iron Mountain Switzerland Gmbh and any other subsidiary of IMIM designated by IMIM (the "Other Subsidiaries") may, with the consent of the administrative
agent, as defined in the New Credit Agreement, borrow under certain of the following tranches of the New Revolving Credit Facility: (a) tranche one in the amount of $400,000 is available to IMI
and IMIM in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling and Euros, (b) tranche two in the amount of $150,000 is available to IMI or IMIM in either U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars and available to
Canada Company in Canadian dollars and (c) tranche three in the amount of $175,000 is available to IMI or IMIM and the Other Subsidiaries in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds
sterling, Euros and Australian dollars, among others. The New

required through maturity on June 27, 2016 in equal quarterly installments of the aggregate annual amounts based upon the following percentage of the original principal amount in the table
below (except that each of the first three quarterly installments in the fifth year shall be 10% of the original principal amount and the final quarterly installment in the fifth year shall be 35% of

The
New Term Loan Facility may be prepaid without penalty or premium, in whole or in part, at any time. IMI and IMIM guarantee the obligations of each of the subsidiary borrowers. The
capital stock or other equity interests of most of the U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first-tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged
to secure the New Credit Agreement, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors. The interest rate on borrowings under the
New Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin, which varies based on certain financial ratios. Additionally, the New Credit
Agreement requires the payment of a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, which fee ranges from between 0.3% to 0.5% based on certain financial ratios, as well as fees
associated with any outstanding letters of credit. Proceeds from the New Credit Agreement are for general corporate purposes and were used to repay the previous revolving credit and term loan
facilities. We recorded a charge of $1,843 to other expense (income), net in the second quarter of 2011 related to the early retirement of the previous revolving credit and term loan facilities,
representing a write-off of deferred financings costs. As of December 31, 2011, we had $96,000 of outstanding borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility, all of which was
denominated in U.S. dollars; we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $5,833. The remaining availability on December 31, 2011, based on IMI's leverage ratio, which is
calculated based on the last 12 months' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), and other adjustments as defined in the New Credit Agreement and current
external debt, under the New Revolving Credit Facility was $623,167. The interest rate in effect under the New Revolving Credit Facility and New Term Loan Facility was 4.0% and 2.3%, respectively, as
of December 31, 2011. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, we recorded commitment fees of $1,953, $2,348 and $2,038, respectively, based on the unused balances under our
revolving credit facilities.

The
New Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict
our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger.
Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the New Credit Agreement, our indentures or other



IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

4. Debt (Continued)

agreements
governing our indebtedness. The New Credit Agreement, as well as our indentures, use EBITDA-based calculations as primary measures of financial performance, including leverage and fixed
charge coverage ratios. IMI's revolving credit and term leverage ratio was 2.9 and 3.4 as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 5.5. Similarly,
our bond leverage ratio, per the indentures, was 3.4 and 3.9 as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5. IMI's revolving credit and term loan
fixed charge coverage ratio was 1.5 as of December 31, 2011, compared to a minimum allowable ratio of 1.2. Noncompliance with these leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios would have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we designated as Excluded Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the indentures), certain of our
subsidiaries that own our assets and conduct our operations in the United Kingdom. As a result of such designation, these subsidiaries are now subject to substantially all of the covenants of the
indentures, except that they are not required to provide a guarantee, and the EBITDA and debt of these subsidiaries is included for purposes of calculating the leverage ratio.

subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the senior subordinated notes. Additionally,
IMI guarantees the Subsidiary Notes. Canada Company does not guarantee the Parent Notes.

In
September 2011, we completed an underwritten public offering of $400,000 in aggregate principal amount of our 7

% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2019, which were
issued at 100% of par. Our net proceeds of $394,000 after paying the underwriters' discounts and commissions, were used for general corporate purposes, including funding a portion of the stockholder
payout commitments we have made.

We
recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $3,031 in the third quarter of 2009 related to the early extinguishment of our 8

Each
of the indentures for the notes provides that we must repurchase, at the option of the holders, the notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon
the occurrence of a "Change of Control," which is defined in each respective indenture. Except for required repurchases upon the occurrence of a Change of Control or in the event of certain asset
sales, each as described in the respective indenture, we are not required to make sinking fund or redemption payments with respect to any of the notes.

Our
indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants including covenants that restrict our ability to complete
acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our
debt rating would not trigger a default under our indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness.

DECEMBER 31, 2011

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

6. Acquisitions

We account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, and, accordingly, the results of operations for each acquisition have been included in our consolidated results
from their respective acquisition dates. Cash consideration for our various acquisitions was primarily provided through borrowings under our credit facilities and cash equivalents on-hand.
We completed no acquisitions during 2009. Included in cash paid for acquisitions in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2009 is contingent and other
payments of $1,518 related to acquisitions made in prior years. The unaudited pro forma results of operations for the current and prior periods are not presented due to the insignificant impact of the
2010 and 2011 acquisitions on our consolidated results of operations. Noteworthy acquisitions are as follows:

In
May 2010 we acquired the remaining 87% interest of our joint venture in Greece (Safe doc S.A.) in a stock transaction for a cash purchase price of approximately $4,700, and we
now control 100% of our Greek operations, which provide storage and records management services. The carrying value of the 13% interest that we had previously acquired and accounted for under the
equity method of accounting amounted to approximately $416 and the fair value of such interest on the date of acquisition was approximately $473 and resulted in a gain being recorded on the date of
the transaction to other (income) expense, net of approximately $57 during the second quarter of 2010.

In
January 2011, we acquired the remaining 80% interest of our joint venture in Poland (Iron Mountain Poland Holdings Limited) in a stock transaction for an estimated purchase price of
approximately $80,000, including an initial cash purchase price of $35,000. As a result, we now own 100% of our Polish operations, which provide storage and records management services. The terms of
the purchase and sale agreement also required a second payment based upon the audited financial results of the joint venture. This payment of $42,259 was based upon a formula defined in the purchase
and sale agreement and was paid in the second quarter of 2011. Additionally, the purchase and sale agreement provides for an escrow hold back of $400 and the payment of up to a maximum of $2,500 of
contingent consideration to be paid in July 2012 based upon the satisfaction of certain performance criteria. The carrying value of the 20% interest that we previously held and accounted for under the
equity method of accounting amounted to approximately $5,774, and the fair value of such interest on the date of the acquisition of the additional 80% interest was approximately $11,694 and resulted
in a gain being recorded to other (income) expense, net of approximately $5,920 in the year ended
December 31, 2011. The fair value of our previously held equity interest was derived by reducing the total estimated consideration for the 80% equity interest purchased by 40%, which represents
management's estimate of the control premium paid, in order to derive the fair value of $11,694 for the 20% noncontrolling equity interest which we previously held. We determined that a 40% control
premium was appropriate after considering the size and location of the business acquired, the potential future profits expected to be generated by the Polish entity and publicly available market data.
One of the members of our board of directors and several of his family members hold an indirect equity interest in one of the stockholders that received proceeds in connection with this transaction.
As a result of this equity interest, such board member, together with several of his family members, received approximately 24% of the purchase price that we paid in connection with this transaction
and will receive the same percentage of any future contingent consideration.

We
have federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2020 through 2025, of $28,183 ($9,864, tax effected) at December 31, 2011 to reduce future federal
taxable income. We have an asset for state net operating losses of $7,915 (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to expire in 2012 through 2025, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately
99%. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $40,334, with various expiration dates, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 69%. We also have foreign tax credits of $56,599,
which begin to expire in 2014 through 2019, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 65%. U.S. legislative changes in 2010 reduced the expected utilization of foreign tax credits which
resulted in the requirement for a valuation allowance.

We
receive a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options or upon the disqualifying disposition by employees of incentive stock options and certain shares
acquired under our employee stock purchase plan for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise or disqualifying disposition.
The tax benefit for non-qualified stock options is included in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which compensation expense is recorded. The tax benefit associated
with compensation expense recorded in the consolidated financial statements related to incentive stock options is recorded in the period the disqualifying disposition occurs. All tax benefits for
awards issued prior to January 1, 2003 and incremental tax benefits in excess of compensation expense recorded in the consolidated financial statements are credited directly to equity and
amounted to $5,532, $2,252 and $919 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

We
have not recorded deferred taxes on book over tax outside basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the
foreseeable future and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis
differences could be reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries and certain other events or actions on our part, each of which would result in an increase
in our provision for income taxes. It is not practicable to calculate the amount of such basis differences.

Our
effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 were 32.9%, 50.1% and 30.2%, respectively. The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory
rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 was the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions of prior years,
expirations of statute of limitation periods and settlements with tax authorities in various jurisdictions and differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject, including
foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. This benefit was partially offset by state income taxes (net of federal benefit). Additionally, to a lesser
extent, a goodwill impairment charge included in income from continuing operations as a component of intangible impairments in our consolidated statements of operations, of which a majority was
non-deductible for tax purposes, is a reconciling item that impacts our effective tax rate. The primary reconciling item between the federal statutory rate of



IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

7. Income Taxes (Continued)

35%
and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 is a goodwill impairment charge included in income from continuing operations as a component of intangible
impairments in our consolidated statements of operations, of which a majority was non-deductible for tax purposes. The negative impact of U.S. legislative changes reducing the expected
utilization of foreign tax credits was offset by the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits due to expirations of statute of limitation periods and settlements with tax
authorities in various jurisdictions. Additionally, to a lesser extent, state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject,
including foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates, are also reconciling items and impact our effective tax rate. In 2009, we had significant unrealized
foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany loans and on
debt and derivative instruments in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. For 2009, foreign currency gains were recorded in lower tax jurisdictions associated with the
marking-to-market of intercompany loan positions while foreign currency losses were recorded in higher tax jurisdictions associated with the
marking-to-market of debt and derivative instruments, which reduced the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009.

The
evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two-step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby the company determines whether it is more likely than not
that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a
measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax
position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

We
have elected to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations. We recorded $4,749, $(1,607) and $(8,477) for gross interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

We
had $11,610 and $2,819 accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

A
summary of tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions is as follows:

normal statute of limitations for U.S. federal tax purposes is three years from the date the tax return is filed. However, due to our net operating loss position, the U.S. government
has the right to audit the amount of the net operating loss up to three years after we utilize the loss on our federal income tax return. We utilized losses from years beginning in 1996, 1998 and 1999
in our federal income tax returns for our 2008, 2009, and 2010 tax years, respectively. The normal statute of

limitations
for state purposes is between three to five years. However, certain of our state statute of limitations remain open for periods longer than this when audits are in progress.

We
are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments
by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2010 and 2011, we had $59,891 and $31,408, respectively, of reserves related to uncertain tax positions
included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and
any related litigation could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in our estimates.

A
reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

believe that it is reasonably possible that an amount up to approximately $10,688 of our unrecognized tax positions may be recognized by the end of 2012 as a result of a lapse of statute of
limitations or upon closing and settling significant audits in various worldwide jurisdictions.

reduced interest expense related to the retirement of a portion of our 7

% Notes due 2015 in the third quarter of 2010 also contributed to the change.

9. Segment Information

As a result of the disposition of our Digital Business and New Zealand Business and our decision to sell the Italian Business as discussed in Note 14, we changed our reportable
segments. The most significant of these changes is that the reportable segment previously referred to as the worldwide digital business is no longer reported separately in our management reporting as
the operations associated with the Domain Name Product Line and the Digital Business are reported as discontinued operations. Also, the technology escrow services business, which we continue to own
and operate and was previously reported in the former worldwide digital business segment, is now reported in the North American Business segment. Additionally, the International Business segment no
longer includes the
New Zealand Business and the Italian Business as these operations are reported as discontinued operations.

Our
operating segments and Corporate are as follows:

•

North American Business—information management services throughout the United States and Canada, including the
storage of paper documents, as well as other media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, X-rays and blueprints, including healthcare information services,
vital records services, service and courier operations, and the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents for corporate customers ("Hard Copy"); the storage and rotation of backup
computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans, including service and courier operations ("Data Protection"); information destruction services ("Destruction"); the scanning, imaging and
document conversion services of active and inactive records ("Hybrid Services"); the storage, assembly, and detailed reporting of customer marketing literature and delivery to sales offices, trade
shows and prospective customers' sites based on current and prospective customer orders ("Fulfillment") and technology escrow services that protect and manage source code.

•

Europe—information management services throughout Europe, including Hard Copy, Data Protection, Destruction
(in the United Kingdom and Ireland) and Hybrid Services.

•

Latin America—information management services throughout Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Peru, including
Hard Copy, Data Protection, Destruction and Hybrid Services.

•

Asia Pacific—information management services throughout Australia, including Hard Copy, Data Protection,
Destruction and Hybrid Services; and in certain cities in India, Singapore, Hong Kong-SAR and China, including Hard Copy and Data Protection.

•

Corporate—consists of costs related to executive and staff functions, including finance, human resources and
information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. These costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the

design
and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. Corporate also includes
stock-based employee compensation expense associated with all Employee Stock-Based Awards.

The
Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe operating segments have been aggregated given their similar economic characteristics, products, customers and processes and reported as one
reportable segment, "International Business."

9. Segment Information (Continued)

The
accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 2. Adjusted OIBDA for each segment is defined as operating income before
depreciation, amortization, intangible impairments and (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net which are directly attributable to the segment. Internally,
we use Adjusted OIBDA as the basis for evaluating the performance of, and allocating resources to, our operating segments.

A
reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to income from continuing operations before provision (benefit) for income taxes on a consolidated basis is as follows:

10. Commitments and Contingencies

a.

Leases

Most
of our leased facilities are leased under various operating leases that typically have initial lease terms of five to ten years. A majority of these leases have renewal options with
one or more five year options to extend and may have fixed or Consumer Price Index escalation clauses. We also lease equipment under operating leases (primarily computers) which have an average lease
life of three years. Vehicles and office equipment are also leased and have remaining lease lives ranging from one
to seven years. Total rent expense (including common area maintenance charges) under all of our operating leases was $240,944, $238,480 and $242,954 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010
and 2011, respectively. Included in total rent expense was sublease income of $4,126, $2,721 and $2,974 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

Estimated
minimum future lease payments (excluding common area maintenance charges) include payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew results in an
economic

total of $18,002).

In
addition, we have certain contractual obligations related to purchase commitments which require minimum payments of $31,852, $11,546, $8,800, $982, $343 and $232 in 2012, 2013, 2014,
2015, 2016 and thereafter, respectively.

b.

Self-Insured
Liabilities

We
are self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers' compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and general business liabilities, and benefits
paid under employee healthcare and short-term disability programs. At December 31, 2010 and 2011 there were $43,901 and $39,358, respectively, of self-insurance accruals
reflected in accrued expenses of our consolidated balance sheets. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected
levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but
not reported. These
methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date.

c.

Litigation

We
are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. A portion of the defense and/or settlement costs associated with such litigation is covered by various
commercial liability insurance policies purchased by us and, in limited cases, indemnification from third parties. Our policy is to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the losses are both
probable and reasonably estimable. We record legal costs associated with loss contingencies as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. The matters described below represent our significant
loss contingencies. We have evaluated each matter and, if both probable and estimable, accrued an amount that represents our



IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

DECEMBER 31, 2011

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

10. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

estimate
of any probable loss associated with such matter. In addition, we have estimated a reasonably possible range for all loss contingencies including those described below. We believe it is
reasonably possible that we could incur aggregate losses in addition to amounts currently accrued for all matters up to an additional $51,300 over the next several years.

d.

London
Fire

In
July 2006, we experienced a significant fire in a leased records and information management facility in London, England, that resulted in the complete destruction of the facility and
its contents. The London Fire Brigade ("LFB") issued a report in which it concluded that the fire resulted either from human agency, i.e., arson, or an unidentified ignition device or source,
and its report to the Home Office concluded that the fire resulted from a deliberate act. The LFB also concluded that the installed sprinkler system failed to control the fire because the primary
electric fire pump was disabled prior to the fire and the standby diesel fire pump was disabled in the early stages of the fire by third-party contractors. We have received notices of claims from
customers or their subrogated insurance carriers under various theories of liability arising out of lost data and/or records as a result of the fire. Certain of those claims have resulted in
litigation in courts in the United Kingdom. We deny any liability in respect of the London fire, and we have referred these claims to our excess warehouse legal liability insurer, which has been
defending them to date under a reservation of rights. Certain of the claims have been settled for nominal amounts, typically one to two British pounds sterling per carton, as specified in the
contracts, which amounts have been or will be reimbursed to us from our primary
property insurer. We believe we carry adequate property and liability insurance related to this incident.

e.

Chile
Earthquake

As
a result of the February 27, 2010 earthquake in Chile, we experienced damage to certain of our 13 owned and leased records management facilities in that region. None of our
facilities were destroyed by fire or significantly impacted by water damage. However, the structural integrity of five buildings was compromised, and some of the racking included in certain buildings
was damaged or destroyed. Some customer materials were impacted by this event. Revenues from Chile represent less than 1% of our consolidated enterprise revenues. We believe we carry adequate property
and liability insurance and do not expect that this event will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. We received cumulative payments of $33,800 from
our insurance carriers of which $27,000 was received in 2010 and $6,800 was received in 2011. Such amount represents final settlements of claims filed with our insurance carriers. Cash from our
insurance settlements was used to fund capital expenditures and for general working capital needs. Our policy related to business interruption insurance recoveries is to record gains within other
(income) expense, net in our consolidated statement of operations and proceeds received within cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Such amounts are
recorded in the period the cash is received. We recorded approximately $100 within other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations associated with business interruption
insurance recoveries in the year ended December 31, 2011. We have recorded gains on the disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net in our statement of operations of
approximately $10,200 for the year ended December 31, 2010. We have reflected approximately $14,800 of the cash proceeds received from our insurers in the year ended December 31, 2010 as
proceeds from sales of property and equipment, net in our statement of cash

flows.
Our policy with respect to involuntary conversion of property, plant and equipment is to record any gain or loss within (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and
equipment, net within operating income in our consolidated statement of operations and proceeds received within cash flows from investing activities within our consolidated statement of cash flows.
Losses are recorded when incurred and gains are recorded in the period when the cash received exceeds the carrying value of the related property, plant and equipment.

f.

Brazilian
Litigation

In
September 2010, Iron Mountain do Brasil Ltda., our Brazilian operating subsidiary ("IMB"), was sued in Curitiba, Brazil in the 11th Lower Labor Claim Court. The
plaintiff in the six related lawsuits, Sindicato dos Trabalhadores em Empresas de Serviços Contábeis, Assessoramento, Perícias,
Informações, Pesquisas, e em Empresas Prestadoras de Serviços do Estado do Paraná (Union of Workers in Business Services Accounting, Advice,
Expertise, Information, Research and Services Companies in the State of Parana), a labor union in Brazil, purported to represent 2,008 individuals who provided services for IMB. The complaint alleged
that these individuals were incorrectly classified as non-employees by IMB and requested unspecified monetary damages, including attorneys' fees, unpaid wages, unpaid benefits and certain
penalties. In August 2011, the court approved a settlement between the parties pursuant to which we will pay $2 for each of 531 individuals, subject to each individual's acceptance thereof. If all 531
individuals accept the settlement, it would result in payment by the Company of approximately $1,100. The claims of the remaining 1,477 individuals in the lawsuits not receiving proceeds in the
settlement were dismissed by the court.

g.

Patent
Infringement Lawsuit

In
August 2010, we were named as a defendant in a patent infringement suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas by Oasis Research, LLC. The plaintiff
alleges that the technology found in our Connected and LiveVault products infringed certain U.S. patents owned by the plaintiff and seeks an unspecified amount of damages. A final
pre-trial conference has been scheduled for October 12, 2012. We expect the court to establish a trial date during the pre-trial conference. As part of the sale of our
Digital Business discussed at Note 14, our Connected and LiveVault products were sold to Autonomy and Autonomy has assumed this obligation and the defense of this litigation and has agreed to
indemnify us against any losses.

h.

Government
Contract Billing Matter

Since
October, 2001, we have provided services to the U.S. Government under several General Services Administration ("GSA") multiple award schedule contracts (the "Schedules"). The
earliest of the Schedules was renewed with certain modifications to its terms in October 2006. The Schedules contain a price reductions clause ("Price Reductions Clause") that requires us to offer to
reduce the prices billed to the Government under the Schedules to correspond to the prices billed to certain benchmark commercial customers. Over the five years and three months ended
December 31, 2011 we billed approximately $42,000 under the Schedules. In 2011, we initiated an internal review covering the contract period commencing in October 2006 and we discovered
potential non-compliance with the Price Reductions Clause. We voluntarily disclosed the potential non-compliance to the GSA and its Office of Inspector General ("OIG") in June
2011. See Note 2.y.

10. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

We
continue to review this matter and will provide the GSA and OIG with information regarding our pricing practices and proposed pricing adjustment amount to be refunded. The GSA and
OIG, however, may not agree with our determination of the refund amount and may request additional pricing adjustments, refunds, civil penalties, up to treble damages and/or interest related to our
Schedules.

State
of Massachusetts Notices of Intention to Assess

We
are currently under audit by the state of Massachusetts for the 2004 through 2008 tax years. We have not received any final assessments to date. However, we have received notices of
intention to assess for the 2004 to 2006 tax years in the amount of $7,867, including tax and penalties (but excluding interest). Currently this audit is on appeal with the Massachusetts Department of
Revenue. The final outcome of this audit may result in an assessment of income tax, which is a component of the income tax provision, or an assessment of net worth tax, which is an operating charge.
We intend to defend this matter vigorously.

j.

Italy
Fire

We
experienced a fire at a facility we lease in Aprilla, Italy on November 4, 2011. All employees were evacuated safely and the cause of the fire is currently being investigated.
The facility primarily stored archival and inactive business records for local area businesses.

The
leased facility, constructed in 2004, is one of approximately 1,000 facilities in our global portfolio and one of 10 facilities located in Italy. Despite quick response by local fire
authorities, damage to the building was extensive and the building appears to be a total loss. We believe we carry adequate insurance and are in the process of assessing the impact of the fire but do
not expect that this event will have a material impact to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our
policy related to business interruption insurance recoveries is to record gains within other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statement of operations and proceeds received
within cash flows from
operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Such amounts are recorded in the period the cash is received. Our policy with respect to involuntary conversion of property, plant and
equipment is to record any gain or loss within (gain) loss on disposal/write-down of property, plant and equipment, net within operating income in our consolidated statement of operations
and proceeds received within cash flows from investing activities within our consolidated statement of cash flows. Losses are recorded when incurred and gains are recorded in the period when the cash
received exceeds the carrying value of the related property, plant and equipment.

11. Related Party Transactions

We lease space to an affiliated company, Schooner Capital LLC ("Schooner"), for its corporate headquarters located in Boston, Massachusetts. For the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, Schooner paid rent to us totaling $177, $198 and $188, respectively. One of the members of our board of directors and several of his family members hold an
indirect equity interest in one of the stockholders that received proceeds in connection with the acquisition of our joint venture in Poland. As a result of this equity interest, such board member,
together with several of his family members,

received
approximately 24% of the purchase price that we paid in connection with this transaction and will receive the same percentage of any future contingent consideration. See Note 6.

12. 401(k) Plans

We have a defined contribution plan, which generally covers all non-union U.S. employees meeting certain service requirements. Eligible employees may elect to defer from 1%
to 25% of compensation per pay period up to the amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, IME operates a defined contribution plan, which is similar to the U.S.'s 401(k) Plan. We make
matching contributions based on the amount of an employee's contribution in accordance with the plan documents. We have expensed $11,508, $14,282 and $18,133 for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

13. Stockholders' Equity Matters

Our board of directors has authorized up to $1,200,000 in repurchases of our common stock. All purchases are subject to stock price, market conditions, corporate and legal requirements
and other factors. As of December 31, 2011, we had a remaining amount available for repurchase under our share repurchase program of $100,701, which represents approximately 2% in the aggregate
of our outstanding common stock based on the closing stock price on such date.

In
February 2010, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Declaration and payment of future quarterly
dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors. In 2010 and 2011, our board of directors declared the following dividends:

preferred stock, designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a price of $120.00 per one one-thousandth of a share, subject to certain
adjustments. No shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock are outstanding as of December 31, 2011. The Rights will expire upon the close of business on the earliest to
occur of: (i) March 22, 2013, (ii) the date on which the Rights are redeemed or exchanged

14. Discontinued Operations

Digital Operations

In August 2010, we divested the Domain Name Product Line for approximately $11,400 in cash at closing which is included in cash flows
from operating activities—discontinued operations. This represented the sale of assets (primarily customer contracts) of a product line. Total revenues of this product line for the year
ended December 31, 2009 and the seven months ended July 31, 2010 were approximately $6,300 and $3,500, respectively. A gain in the amount of approximately $6,900 ($2,834, net of tax) was
recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2010 and is included in loss from discontinued operations, net of tax.

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2010, we concluded that events occurred and circumstances changed in our former worldwide digital business reporting unit that required us
to conduct an impairment review. The primary factors contributing to our conclusion that we had a triggering event and a requirement to reassess our former worldwide digital business reporting unit
goodwill for impairment included: (1) a reduction in forecasted revenue and operating results due to continued pressure on key parts of the business as a result of the weak economy;
(2) reduced revenue and profit outlook for our eDiscovery service due to smaller average matter size and lower pricing; (3) a decision to discontinue certain software development
projects; and (4) the sale of the Domain Name Product Line. As a result of the review, we recorded a provisional goodwill impairment charge associated with our former worldwide digital business
reporting unit in the amount of $255,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. We finalized the estimate in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we recorded an additional impairment of
$28,785, for a total goodwill impairment charge of $283,785. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we allocated $85,909 of this charge to the retained technology escrow services business, based
on a relative fair value basis, which charge continues to be included in our continuing results of operations as a component of intangible impairments in our consolidated statements of operations. As
described in Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, our technology escrow services business, which had been reported in our former worldwide digital business
segment, is now reported as a component of our North American Business segment. In April 2011, we announced a comprehensive strategic plan, which included exploring strategic alternatives for our
digital business, including a potential sale of the Digital Business.

14. Discontinued Operations (Continued)

On June 2, 2011, IMI completed the sale of the Digital Business to Autonomy, pursuant to the Digital Sale Agreement. In the Digital Sale, Autonomy purchased (i) the shares
of certain of IMI's subsidiaries through which IMI conducted the Digital Business and (ii) certain assets of IMI and its subsidiaries relating to our Digital Business. The Digital Sale
qualified as discontinued operations because (a) the remaining direct gross cash inflows and outflows of the Digital Business by IMI post-close are not expected to be significant in
relation to the direct gross cash inflows and outflows absent the Digital Sale and (b) there is no significant continuing involvement because IMI does not retain the ability to influence the
operating and financial policies of the Digital Business. As a result, the financial position, operating results and cash flows of the Digital Business and the Domain Name Product Line, for all
periods presented, including the gains on the sales, have been reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes.

Pursuant
to the Digital Sale Agreement, IMI received approximately $395,400 in cash, consisting of the initial purchase price of $380,000 and a preliminary working capital adjustment of
approximately $15,400, which remains subject to a customary post-closing adjustment based on the amount of working capital at closing. The purchase price for the Digital Sale will be
increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis if the working capital balance at the time of closing exceeds the target amount of working capital as set forth in the Digital Sale
Agreement and decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis if such closing working capital balance is less than the target amount. We and Autonomy are in disagreement regarding the
working capital adjustment in the Digital Sale Agreement. As a result, as contemplated by the Digital Sale Agreement, the matter is being referred to an independent third party accounting firm for
determination of the appropriate adjustment amount. Transaction costs relating to the Digital Sale amounted to $7,387 ($774 of such costs were unpaid as of December 31, 2011). Additionally,
$11,075 of inducements are payable to Autonomy and have been netted against the proceeds in calculating the gain on the Digital Sale ($6,000 of such amount was unpaid as of December 31, 2011).
We used the net proceeds received from the Digital Sale to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Also, a tax provision of $45,126 associated with the gain recorded on the
Digital Sale was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2011. A gain on sale of discontinued operations in the amount of $243,861 ($198,735, net of tax) was recorded during the year ended
December 31, 2011, as a result of the Digital Sale. Approximately $3,828 of cumulative translation adjustment associated with our Digital Business was reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive items, net and reduced the gain on the Digital Sale by the same amount.

have been no allocations of corporate general and administrative expenses to discontinued operations. In accordance with our policy, we have allocated corporate interest associated
with all debt that is not specifically allocated to a particular component based on the proportion of the assets of the Digital Business and the Domain Name Product Line to our total consolidated
assets at the applicable weighted average interest rate associated with such debt for such reporting period. Interest allocated to the Digital Business and the Domain Name Product Line and included in
loss from discontinued operations amounted to $13,041, $14,336 and $2,396 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

In
connection with the Digital Sale, we entered into several other arrangements with Autonomy, including:

•

A reseller agreement with Autonomy that allows us to sell certain products and services of the Digital Business now owned
by Autonomy and certain other Autonomy products and services (the "Products and Services") over a three year period beginning June 2, 2011. The reseller agreement provides for the payments to
Autonomy of: (i) $3,500, which was paid on the closing of the Digital Sale; and (ii) $6,000 on June 2, 2012. Such amounts represent prepayments of amounts payable to Autonomy
related to qualifying sales of Products and Services to new customers of the Digital Business and are non-refundable to the extent we do not achieve the requisite level of qualifying sales
of Products and Services during the term of the reseller agreement.

•

A co-location agreement with Autonomy in which we will provide certain storage related services associated
with certain data centers to Autonomy for a two year transitional period beginning June 2, 2011. Autonomy has the right to extend this period by two additional years upon six months notice
prior to the end of the first two-year term.

14. Discontinued Operations (Continued)

•

A transitional services agreement to provide certain services, generally for a period no longer than six months, including
general, administrative, finance, human resource and information technology services.

•

The payment by us to Autonomy of approximately $3,075 as of the closing for the purchase of certain Products and Services
for our internal use.

The
revenues and corresponding expenses associated with the above agreements are reflected in our continuing operating results. None of these services gives us the ability to influence
the operating and financial policies of the Digital Business. We have concluded that the direct cash flows associated with these agreements are not significant because they are estimated to represent
less than 5% of both direct cash inflows and outflows of the Digital Business for the one-year period subsequent to the Digital Sale, and, therefore, we have reported the Digital Business
as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. We will continue to assess the cash flows associated with these agreements and our
conclusion that the Digital Business be reported as discontinued operations until the first anniversary of the Digital Sale.

In
February 2010, we acquired the stock of Mimosa Systems, Inc. ("Mimosa"), a provider of enterprise-class digital content archiving solutions, for approximately $112,000 in cash
and approximately $2,000 in fair value of options issued. Mimosa was subsequently disposed of in the sale of our Digital Business in June 2011. The purchase price paid by IMI for the Mimosa
acquisition is included in cash flows from investing activities-discontinued operations in our fiscal year 2010 statement of cash flows.

New Zealand Business

After further analysis subsequent to our April 2011 announcement of our comprehensive strategic plan, which includes reviewing select
underperforming international markets, we committed in May 2011 to a plan to sell the New Zealand Business. During the second quarter of 2011, we recorded an impairment charge of $4,900 to
write-down the long-lived assets of the New Zealand Business to its estimated net realizable value which is included in loss from discontinued operations. In the calculation of
the carrying value of the New Zealand Business, we allocated the goodwill of our Australia/New Zealand reporting unit between Australia and New Zealand on a relative fair value basis. Additionally, we
recorded a tax benefit of $7,883 during the year ended December 31, 2011 associated with the outside tax basis of the New Zealand Business, which is also reflected in loss from discontinued
operations. No valuation allowance was provided against this benefit because such amount is recoverable against the capital gain associated with the Digital Sale. We completed the sale of the New
Zealand Business on October 3, 2011 for a purchase price of approximately $10,000. We recorded a gain on the sale of discontinued operations associated with the New Zealand Business of $1,884
during the fourth quarter of 2011 which primarily represents cumulative translation adjustment associated with our New Zealand operations which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive
items, net and increased the gain on the sale of New Zealand by that same amount. The New Zealand Business was previously included within the International Business segment. For all periods presented,
the financial position, operating results and cash flows of the New Zealand Business, including the gain on the sale, have been reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes.

Italian Business

After further analysis subsequent to our April 2011 announcement of our comprehensive strategic plan, which includes reviewing select
underperforming international markets, we committed in December 2011 to a plan to sell the Italian Business. In the calculation of the carrying value of the Italian Business, we allocated the goodwill
of our Western European reporting unit between the Italian Business and the remainder of this reporting unit on a relative fair value basis. Additionally, in conjunction with the goodwill impairment
analysis performed associated with our Western Europe reporting unit, we performed an impairment test on the long-lived assets of our Italian Business in the third quarter of 2011. The
undiscounted cash flows from the Italian Business were lower than the carrying value of the long-lived assets associated with the operations of the Italian Business and resulted in the
requirement to fair value the long-lived assets of this lower level component. As a result, we recorded write-offs of other intangible assets, primarily customer relationship
values of $8,000, and certain write-downs to property, plant and equipment (primarily racking) long-lived assets in Italy of $6,600 in the third quarter of 2011, which are included in loss
from discontinued operations. We allocated $2,500 of the Western Europe goodwill impairment charge to the Italian Business which is also included in loss from discontinued operations for the year
ended December 31, 2011. The Italian Business was previously included within the International Business segment. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011, the Italian Business has been
classified as held for sale and, for all periods presented, the financial position, operating results and cash flows of the Italian Business have been reported as discontinued operations for financial
reporting purposes.
