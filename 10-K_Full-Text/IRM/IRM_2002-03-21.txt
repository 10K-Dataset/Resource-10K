Item 1. Business.

A. Development of Business.

We are the leader in outsourced records and information management services ("RIMS"). We are an international, full-service provider of records and
information management and related services, enabling customers to outsource these functions. We have a diversified customer base that includes more than half of the Fortune 500 and numerous
commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment, and government organizations. We provide storage for all major media, including paper, which is the dominant form of
records storage, magnetic media (including computer tapes), microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film and optical disks, X-rays and blueprints. Our principal services
provided to our storage customers include courier pick-up and delivery, filing, retrieval and destruction of records, database management, customized reporting and disaster recovery
support. We also sell storage materials, including cardboard boxes and magnetic media, and provide confidential destruction, consulting, facilities management, fulfillment and other outsourcing
services.

Iron
Mountain was founded in 1951 in an underground facility near Hudson, New York. Now in our 51

st

year, we have experienced tremendous growth and organizational change
particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in February 1996. Since then, we have built ourselves from a regional business with limited product
offerings and annual revenues of $104 million for 1995 into the global leader in outsourced records and information management services, providing a full range of services to customers in 124
markets around the world. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we had total revenues of nearly $1.2 billion.

The
growth since 1995 has been accomplished primarily through the acquisition of 79 domestic and 17 international records management companies, including two acquisitions completed in
the first quarter of 2002. The goal of our current acquisition program is to supplement internal growth by continuing to establish a footprint in targeted international markets and adding
fold-in acquisitions both domestically and internationally. Having substantially completed our North American geographic expansion, we shifted our focus from growth through acquisitions to
internal revenue growth. In 2001, as a result of this recent shift, internal revenue growth exceeded growth through acquisitions for the first time since we began our acquisition program in 1996. In
addition, our capital expenditures, made primarily to support internal growth, exceeded the aggregate acquisition consideration we conveyed in 2001. We expect this trend to continue and to achieve
this internal growth through the use of aggressive selling efforts to acquire new customers and by offering a wide range of complementary and ancillary services to expand our new and existing customer
relationships.

On
February 1, 2000, we completed our most important acquisition to date by merging with Pierce Leahy Corp. in a stock-for-stock merger valued at
$1.0 billion, including the assumption of debt and related transaction costs. Since the merger, we have been integrating the cultures, operating systems and procedures, and information
technology systems of Iron Mountain and Pierce Leahy. The integration process is continuing and is expected to proceed through 2002. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As
of December 31, 2001, we provided services to over 150,000 customer accounts in 80 markets in the United States and 44 markets outside of the United States, employed over
11,000 people and operated over 650 records management facilities in the United States, Canada, Europe and Latin America.


B. Description of Business.

The Records and Information Management Services Industry

Overview

Companies in the RIMS industry store and manage information in a variety of media formats, which can broadly be divided into paper and electronic records, and
provide a wide range of services related
to the records stored. We refer to our general paper storage and management services as "business records management." Paper records are defined to include paper documents, as well as all other
non-electronic media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, X-rays and blueprints. Electronic records include various forms of magnetic media such
as computer tapes and hard drives and optical disks. We refer to our electronic records storage and management services as "data security services" and "e-Vaulting" (collectively,
off-site data protection) and "digital archiving services."

Paper Records

Paper records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. Active records relate to ongoing and recently completed activities or contain
information that is frequently referenced. Active records are usually stored and managed on-site by the organization that originated them to ensure ready availability. Inactive paper
records are the principal focus of the RIMS industry. Inactive records consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be retained for legal, regulatory and compliance
reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. Based on industry studies, we believe that inactive records make up approximately 80% of all paper records. A large and
growing specialty subset of the paper records market is medical records. These are active and semi-active records that are often stored off-site with and serviced by a RIMS
vendor. Special regulatory requirements often apply to medical records.

Electronic Records

Electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that are either a back-up copy of recently processed
data or archival in nature. Back-up data exists because of the need of many businesses to maintain back-up copies of data in order to be able to operate in the event of a
system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. It is customary for data processing groups to rotate back-up tapes to off-site locations on a regular basis and to require
multiple copies of such information at multiple sites. We refer to these services as "data security services."

In
addition to the management of physical copies of back-up data, we are introducing new services that allow for the direct transfer, storage and retrieval of
back-up data between our customers and our secure electronic media storage facilities via public broadband communications networks. We refer to these services as "e-Vaulting."

Archival
data is generally retained for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. Historically, archival data, as
well as back-up data, has been stored on physical media such as computer tapes or optical disks. We are collaborating with other companies to develop technologies to provide storage and
related services for this data electronically in its original digital format. Customers' data will be captured via telecommunication lines or the Internet. Based on the nature of the data, customers
can choose to store their data on-line for
real-time access, near-line access for a slightly lower cost or off-line on computer tapes or disks for less time-critical data. We refer to these
developing services as "digital archiving services."


Growth of Market

We believe that the volume of stored paper and electronic records will continue to increase for a number of reasons, including: (i) the rapid growth of
inexpensive document producing technologies such as facsimile, desktop publishing software and desktop printing; (ii) the continued proliferation of data processing technologies such as
personal computers and networks; (iii) regulatory requirements; (iv) concerns over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of documentation;
(v) the high cost of reviewing records and deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (vi) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and
(vii) audit requirements to keep back-up copies of certain records in off-site locations.

Despite
the growth of new "paperless" technologies, such as the Internet and e-mail, we believe that stored information remains predominantly paper-based. These technologies
have prompted the creation of hard copies of such electronic information and have also led to increased demand for data security services, such as the storage and off-site rotation of
back-up copies of magnetic media, and outsourcing support services that address the needs of data center operations and disaster recovery programs. In addition, we believe that the
proliferation of digital information technologies and distributed data networks has created an emerging need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality solutions for electronic archiving
and the management of electronic documents.

Consolidation of a Highly Fragmented Industry

Over the past several years, there has been consolidation in the highly fragmented RIMS industry. Most RIMS companies serve a single local market, and are often
either owner-operated or ancillary to another business, such as a moving and storage company. We believe that this trend will continue because of the industry's capital requirements for growth,
opportunities for large RIMS providers to achieve economies of scale and customer demands for more sophisticated technology-based solutions.

We
believe that the consolidation trend in the industry is also due to, and will continue as a result of, the preference of certain large organizations to contract with one vendor in
multiple cities and countries for multiple services. In particular, customers increasingly demand a single, large, sophisticated company to handle all of their important paper and electronic records
needs. Large, national and multinational companies are better able to satisfy these demands than smaller competitors. We have made, and intend to continue to make, acquisitions of our competitors,
many of whom are small, single city operators.

Description of Our Business

We generate our revenues by providing storage for a variety of information media formats, core records management services and an expanding menu of complementary
products and services to a large and diverse customer base. Providing outsourced storage for records and information is the mainstay of our customer relationships and provides the foundation for our
revenue growth. The core services, which are a vital part of a comprehensive records management program, are highly recurring in nature and therefore very predictable. Core services consist primarily
of the handling and transportation of stored records and information. In our confidential destruction business, core services consist primarily of the scheduled collection and handling of sensitive
records. In 2001, our storage and core service revenues represented approximately 86% of our total revenues. In addition to our core services, we offer a wide array of complementary products and
services such as performing special project work, selling RIMS-related products, providing fulfillment services and consulting on records management issues. These services address more specific needs
and are designed to enhance our customers' overall records management programs. These services complement our core services; however, they are more episodic and discretionary in nature. Revenue
generated by our business records and off-site data protection businesses includes both core and complementary components.


Business Records Management

The hard copy business records stored by our customers with us by their nature are not very active. These types of records are stored in cartons packed by the
customer. We use bar-coded tracking technologies known as the

Safekeeper

™ system and the

SafekeeperPLUS

™ system, which combines the architecture
of the

Pierce Leahy User
Solution

® ("

PLUS

®") system and the enhanced functionality of

Safekeeper

™, and other procedures to ensure the integrity
of the contents of a customer's cartons and to efficiently store and later
retrieve a customer's cartons. As a central component of our integration plan for the Pierce Leahy transaction, we developed

SafekeeperPLUS

™
and continue a city-by-city conversion program that is expected to be completed in 2002. Storage charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis, usually
either per carton or per cubic foot of records, and include the provision of space, racking, computerized inventory and activity tracking and physical security.

Off-Site Data Protection

Data security services consist of the storage and rotation of back-up computer media as part of corporate disaster and business recovery plans.
Computer tapes, cartridges and disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where they are available to
customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to facilitate data recovery in the event of a disaster. We use various information technology systems such as

MediaLink™

and

SecureBase™

software to manage this process. We also manage tape library relocation and support disaster recovery testing and execution.
We are now in the early stages of offering e-Vaulting as part of our off-site data protection services product line. E-Vaulting allows customers to utilize
different levels of electronic transfer, storage and recovery of critical back-up data ranging from real time transfers using storage silos to electronic transfer and off-line
storage for less immediate needs.

Healthcare Information Services

Healthcare information services principally include the handling, storage, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records used by hospitals, private
practitioners and other medical institutions. Medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically stored on specialized shelving systems that provide access to individual files.
Healthcare information services also include recurring project work and ancillary services. Recurring project work involves the on-site removal of aged patient files and related
computerized file indexing. Ancillary healthcare information services include release of information, temporary staffing, contract coding, facilities management and imaging.

Vital Records Services

Vital records contain critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film, software source code and other highly proprietary
information. Vital records may require special facilities or services, either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. Our charges for providing enhanced security and
special climate-controlled environments for vital records are higher than for typical storage functions. We provide the same ancillary services for vital records as we provide for our other storage
operations.

Service and Courier Operations

Service and courier operations are an integral part of a comprehensive records management program for all physical media including paper and electronic records.
They include adding records to storage, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, permanent withdrawals from storage, and destruction of records. Service charges are
generally assessed for each procedure on a per unit basis. The

Safekeeper

and

SafekeeperPLUS

systems
control the service processes from order entry through transportation and invoicing for business records while

MediaLink

and

SecureBase

manage the process
for the data security services business.


Courier
operations consist primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request. Charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location and
are billed monthly. As of December 31, 2001, we were utilizing a fleet of more than 2,000 owned or leased delivery vehicles.

Confidential Destruction

Confidential destruction involves the shredding of sensitive documents for corporate customers that, in many cases, also use our services for management of less
sensitive archival records. We believe that customers are motivated by privacy regulation and the desire to protect their proprietary trade secrets. These services typically include the scheduled
pick-up of loose office records which customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide. Complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste
paper to third-party recyclers. We currently perform these services in 23 markets and seek to expand our presence in this business through acquisitions and internal start-ups.

Intellectual Property Protection Services

We provide intellectual property protection services through our wholly owned subsidiary, DSI Technology Escrow Services, Inc. DSI specializes in third
party technology escrow services that protect intellectual property assets such as software source code. In addition, DSI assists in securing intellectual property as collateral for lending,
investments and other joint ventures, in managing domain name registrations and transfers, and provide expertise and assistance in complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") electronic records regulations.

Digital Archiving Services

Our digital archiving services focus on archiving digital information with long-term preservation requirements. These services represent the digital analogy to
our paper records management services. Typical digital records include electronic mail, electronic documents retained for legal or compliance purposes and other electronic records documenting business
transactions. Digital archiving services are offered for image-based records as well.

The
growth rate of mission-critical digital information is accelerating, driven in part by the use of the Internet as a distribution and transaction medium. The rising cost and
increasing importance of digital information management, coupled with the increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may create meaningful opportunities for us. We are
cultivating marketing partnerships with technology providers whose products can interface with our digital archives.

We
believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they face in their business records management programs and consist
primarily of: (i) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (ii) access to and control over the data in a secure environment; and (iii) the need to keep electronic records
due to regulatory compliance or for litigation support. Products and services are currently being developed to address these needs and expand the array of services we may offer for electronic records.

Complementary Services and Products

We offer a variety of additional services within all of our business lines, which customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. These services
include conducting records inventories, packing records into cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. We also provide services for the
management of active records programs. We can provide these services, which generally include document and file processing and storage, both off-site at our own facilities and by supplying
our own personnel to perform management functions on-site at the customer's premises.


Other
complementary lines of business that we operate include fulfillment services and professional consulting services. Fulfillment services are performed by our wholly owned
subsidiary, COMAC, Inc. COMAC stores customer marketing literature and delivers this material to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' sites based on current and prospective
customer orders. In addition, COMAC assembles custom marketing packages and orders, and manages and provides detailed reporting on customer marketing literature inventories.

We
provide professional consulting services to customers, enabling them to develop and implement comprehensive records and information management programs. Our consulting business draws
on our experience in RIMS to analyze the practices of such companies and assist them in creating more effective programs of records and information management. Our consultants work with these
customers to develop policies for document review, analysis and evaluation and for scheduling of document retention and destruction.

We
also sell: (i) a full line of specially designed corrugated cardboard, metal and plastic storage containers; (ii) magnetic media products including computer tapes,
cartridges and drives, tape cleaners and supplies and CDs; and (iii) computer room equipment and supplies such as racking systems, furniture, bar code scanners and printers.

The
amount of revenues derived from our business records management, off-site data protection, international and other operating segments and other relevant financial data
for fiscal years 1999, 2000 and 2001 are set forth in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Financial Characteristics of Our Business

Our financial model is based on the recurring nature of our revenues. The historical predictability of this revenue stream and the resulting EBITDA (earnings from
continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA


allow us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. Since 1995, we have invested approximately $2.8 billion in acquisitions and capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment
to support our growth. Our primary financial goal has always been, and continues to be, to increase consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in relation to capital invested, even as our focus has shifted from
growth through acquisitions to internal revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA is a source of funds for investment in continued growth and for servicing indebtedness. Our business has the following financial
characteristics:


Adjusted
EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for extraordinary items, other income (expense), merger-related expenses, stock option compensation expense and minority interest.
Merger-related expenses are primarily those expenses directly related to our merger with Pierce Leahy that cannot be capitalized and include severance and pay-to-stay payments,
costs of exiting certain facilities, system conversion costs and other transaction-related costs. Stock option compensation expense represents non-cash charges resulting from the
acceleration and extension of previously granted stock options as part of separation agreements with certain executives.

Adjusted
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-based calculations are used by the holders of our publicly issued debt as important criteria for evaluating our business and, as a result, all of our bond
indentures contain covenants in which Adjusted EBITDA-based calculations are used as the primary measure of financial performance. In addition, we use Adjusted EBITDA as the basis for evaluating the
performance of and as a basis for allocating resources to our internal operating segments. However, you should not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA to be substitutes for operating or net income (as
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) as indicators of our performance or for cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures
of liquidity.

•

Recurring Revenues

. We derive a majority of our consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly,
fees charged to customers based on the volume of records stored. Our revenues


from
these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 52 consecutive quarters. Once a customer places paper records in storage with us and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed,
for which we typically receive a service fee, we receive recurring payments for storage fees without incurring additional labor or marketing expenses or significant capital costs. Similarly, contracts
for the storage of electronic back-up media consist primarily of fixed monthly payments. In each of the last five years, storage revenues, which are stable and recurring, have accounted
for approximately 60% of our total revenues. This stable and growing storage base also provides the foundation for increases in revenues, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.

•

Historically Non-Cyclical Business

. We have not experienced any significant reductions of our
storage business as a result of past general economic downturns, although we can give no assurance that this would be the case in the future. During this most recent economic slowdown some customers
delayed or postponed expenditures for certain complementary records management projects. Additionally, the rate at which customers added new cartons to their inventory with us slowed somewhat, which
may be a result of current economic conditions. We believe that companies that have outsourced RIMS programs are less likely during economic downturns to incur the move-out costs and other
expenses associated with switching vendors or moving their RIMS programs in-house. However, some customers may cancel or delay certain non-recurring or discretionary
expenditures as a means of reducing their short-term costs.

•

Inherent Growth from Existing Paper Records Customers.

Our paper records customers have on average
generated
additional Cartons


at a faster rate than stored Cartons have been destroyed or permanently removed. From January 1, 1996 through December 31, 2001, our annual Net Carton
Growth From Existing Customers


has averaged in excess of 5%. We believe the consistent growth of our paper storage revenues is the result of a number of factors, including:
(i) the trend toward increased records retention; (ii) customer satisfaction with our services; and (iii) the costs and inconvenience of moving storage operations
in-house or to another provider of RIMS.


The
term "Carton" is defined as a measurement of volume equal to a single standard storage carton, approximately 1.2 cubic feet. The number of cartons stored does not include storage
volumes in our vital records services and data security services, which are described below.


The
term "Net Carton Growth From Existing Customers" is defined as the increase in net Cartons attributable to existing customers without giving effect to the loss of approximately
1.0 million Cartons in fires attributed to arson in March 1997 in two of our facilities in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey. See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings." This calculation also
excludes our Latin American and European operations as well as a portion of our medical records operations.

•

Diversified and Stable Customer Base

. As of December 31, 2001, we had over 150,000 customer accounts
in a variety of industries. We currently provide services to more than half of the Fortune 500 and numerous commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment, and government
organizations. No customer accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001. From January 1, 1996 through December 31, 2001, average
annual permanent removals of Cartons, not including destructions, represented approximately 4% of total Cartons stored.

•

Capital Expenditures Related Primarily to
Growth

. Our RIMS business requires limited annual capital
expenditures made in order to maintain our current revenue stream. From January 1, 1996 through December 31, 2001, approximately 90% of our aggregate capital expenditures were
growth-related investments, primarily in storage systems, management information systems, new buildings and improvements to existing facilities. These growth-related capital expenditures are primarily
discretionary and create additional capacity for increases in revenues, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.


Growth Strategy

Our objective is to maintain our position as the leader in records and information management services. Domestically, we seek to be one of the largest RIMS
providers in each of our geographic markets. Internationally, the objectives are to continue to capitalize on our expertise in the RIMS industry and to make additional acquisitions and investments in
selected international markets. Our primary avenues of growth are: (i) increased business with existing customers; (ii) additions of new customers; (iii) the introduction of new
products and services such as e-Vaulting, digital archiving and confidential destruction; and (iv) selective acquisitions in new and existing markets.

Growth from Existing Customers

Our existing customers storing paper records contribute to storage and storage-related services revenue growth because on average they generate additional Cartons
at a faster rate than old Cartons are destroyed or permanently removed. In order to maximize growth opportunities from existing customers, we seek to maintain high levels of customer retention by
providing premium customer service through our local management staff.

Through
our local account management staff, we leverage existing business relationships with our customers by selling complementary services and products. Services include records
tracking, indexing, customized reporting, vital records management and consulting services.

Additions of New Customers

Our sales force is dedicated to two primary objectives: establishing new customer account relationships and expanding new and existing customer relationships by
offering a wide array of complementary services and products. In order to accomplish these objectives, the sales force draws on our national marketing organization and senior management. As a result
of acquisitions and our decision to recruit additional qualified sales professionals, we have increased the size of our sales force to approximately 390 such professionals as of December 31,
2001.

Introduction of New Products and Services

We continue to expand our menu of products and services. We have significantly increased our presence in the confidential destruction industry and are in the
process of developing new e-Vaulting and digital archiving services. These new products and services allow us to further penetrate our existing customer accounts and attract new customers
in previously untapped markets.

Growth through Domestic Acquisitions

Our acquisition strategy includes expanding geographically, as necessary, and increasing our presence and scale within existing markets through
"fold-in" acquisitions. We have a successful record of acquiring and integrating RIMS companies. See "—Completed Acquisitions." We intend to continue our domestic acquisition
program. However, given the small number of large acquisition prospects and our increased revenue base, future acquisitions are expected to be less significant to overall domestic revenue growth than
they have been historically.

International Growth Strategy

We also intend to continue to make acquisitions and investments in RIMS businesses outside the United States. We have acquired and invested in, and seek to
acquire and invest in, RIMS companies in countries, and, more specifically, markets within such countries, where we believe there is sufficient demand from existing multinational customers or the
potential for growth. Since beginning our international expansion program in January 1999, directly and through joint ventures, we have


expanded our operations into Canada, Europe and Latin America. These transactions have taken, and may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of the entire business or controlling or minority
investments, with a long-term goal of full ownership. In addition to the criteria we use to evaluate domestic acquisition candidates, we also evaluate the presence in the potential market
of our existing clients as well as the risks uniquely associated with an international investment, including those risks described below.

The
experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important in our international acquisition strategy. As a result, we have formed joint ventures with, or acquired
significant interests in, target businesses throughout Europe and Latin America. We have a 50.1% controlling interest in each of our Iron Mountain Europe Limited, Iron Mountain South America, Ltd. and
Sistemas de Archivo Corporativo (a Mexican limited liability company) subsidiaries. Iron Mountain South America has in some cases bought controlling, yet not full, ownership in local businesses in
order to enhance our local market expertise. We believe this strategy, rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets, better position us to expand the existing business, although our
long-term goal is to acquire full
ownership of each such business. The local partner benefits from our expertise in the RIMS industry and, in certain cases, our technology, and we benefit from our local partner's knowledge of the
market, relationships with customers and their presence in the community.

Our
international investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as
fluctuations in currency valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors. At this time, there can be no assurance as to whether any
international investment will be successful in achieving our objectives.

The
amount of our revenues derived from international operations and other relevant financial data for fiscal years 1999, 2000 and 2001 are set forth in Note 12 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2001, we derived approximately 13% of our revenues from outside of the United States.

Completed Acquisitions

As part of our growth strategy, from January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2001, we acquired 45 RIMS businesses. The following table presents certain
information with respect to the acquisitions completed by us between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2001 (dollars in millions):

Total
annual aggregate revenues were calculated in each case by reference to the revenues of each of the acquired businesses during the year in which they were acquired. This
calculation includes an estimate of total revenues for the portion of the year of acquisition during which any such acquired business was not included in our results of operations.

The
total purchase price for the 2000 Acquisitions includes $1.0 billion for the acquisition of Pierce Leahy on February 1, 2000.


Customers

Our customer base is diversified in terms of revenues and industry concentration. We track customer accounts based on invoices. Accordingly, depending upon how
many invoices have been arranged at the request of a customer, one organization may represent multiple customer accounts. As of December 31, 2001, we had over 150,000 customer accounts in a
variety of industries. We currently provide services to more than half of the Fortune 500 and numerous commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment, and government
organizations. No customer accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Competition; Alternative Technologies

We compete with our current and potential customers' internal records and information management services capabilities. We can provide no assurance that these
organizations will begin or continue to use
an outside company such as Iron Mountain for their future records and information management services.

We
compete with multiple RIMS providers in all geographic areas where we operate. We believe that competition for customers is based on price, reputation for reliability, quality of
service and scope and scale of technology and that we generally compete effectively based on these factors.

We
also compete with other RIMS providers for companies to acquire. Some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources. If any such competitor were to devote
additional resources to the RIMS business and such acquisition candidates or focus their strategy on our markets, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

We
derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage-related services. This storage requires significant physical space. Alternative storage technologies exist,
many of which require significantly less space than paper. These technologies include computer media, microform, CD-ROM and optical disk. To date, none of these technologies has replaced
paper as the principal means for storing information. However, we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records in paper format. A significant shift by our
customers to storage of data through non-paper based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our business. We are collaborating with other
companies to develop e-Vaulting and digital archiving service products designed to address our customers' emerging need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality solutions
for electronic archiving and the management of electronic documents.

Employees

As of December 31, 2001, we employed approximately 8,700 full-time employees in the United States. Directly and through majority-owned joint
ventures, as of December 31, 2001, we employed approximately 2,600 full-time employees outside of the United States. A small percentage of our employees are represented by unions.
These unionized employees are located in California and one city in Canada. As of December 31, 2001, the aggregate number of unionized employees was approximately 365.

All
domestic non-union employees are eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability and
accidental death and dismemberment plans. Unionized employees receive these types of benefits through their unions. In addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, all full-time
domestic employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on profits, collections or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in which
they work. International employees participate


in separate benefit and incentive-based compensation programs. Management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and unions.

Insurance

For strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and in amounts that we believe
to be appropriate. Property insurance is purchased on an all-risk basis, including flood and earthquake, subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles, and inclusive of
the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. Separate policies for California earthquake exposures are maintained at
what we believe to be appropriate limits and deductibles for that exposure. Included among other types of insurance carried by us are: workers compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile,
and directors and officers policies.

Our
standard form of storage contract sets forth an agreed maximum valuation for each carton or other storage unit held by us, which serves as a limitation of liability for loss or
damage, as permitted under the Uniform Commercial Code. In contracts containing such limits, such values are nominal, and we believe that in typical circumstances our liability would be so limited in
the event of loss or damage to stored items for which we may be held liable. However, some of our agreements with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no
such limits or contain higher limits or supplemental insurance arrangements. See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" for a description of claims by particular customers seeking to rescind their contracts,
including limitations on liability, as a result of the fires experienced at our South Brunswick Township, New Jersey facilities in 1997.

Environmental Matters

Some of our currently and formerly owned or operated properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the
use or storage of hazardous substances or petroleum products or may have involved the generation of hazardous wastes. In some instances these properties included the operation of underground storage
tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. Although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current
facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be potentially liable for
environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at these properties as well as damages arising from such contamination. Environmental conditions for which we
might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. In addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not
exist today.

We
currently transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing a pollution liability insurance policy, which covers all
owned and leased locations. Coverage is provided for both liability and remediation exposures.

Item 2. Properties.

As of December 31, 2001, we conducted operations through 519 leased and 134 owned facilities containing a total of 41.5 million square feet of
space. The leased facilities typically have initial lease terms of ten years with options to renew for an additional five to ten years. In addition, some of the leases contain either a purchase option
or a right of first refusal upon the sale of the property. Our facilities are located throughout North America, Europe and Latin America, with the largest number of facilities in California, Florida,
Illinois, New Jersey, Texas, Canada and the United Kingdom. We believe that the space available in our facilities is adequate to meet our current needs. See Note 13 of


Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our minimum annual rental commitments.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

In March 1997, we experienced three fires, all of which authorities have determined were caused by arson. The fires resulted in damage to one and
destruction of our other RIMS facility in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey.

Certain
of our customers or their insurance carriers have asserted claims as a consequence of the destruction of, or damage to, their records as a result of the fires, including claims
with specific requests for compensation and allegations of negligence or other culpability on the part of Iron Mountain. We and our insurers have denied any liability on the part of Iron Mountain as
to all of these claims.

We
are presently aware of five pending lawsuits that have been filed against Iron Mountain by certain of our customers and/or their insurers, and of two lawsuits filed by the insurers of
abutters of the South Brunswick facility, and of one lawsuit filed by a fire official who claims that he was injured in the course of fighting the first fire. Seven of these eight lawsuits have been
consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the Middlesex County, New Jersey, Superior Court. The eighth lawsuit, brought by a single customer, is pending in the Supreme Court for New York
County, New York. A ninth lawsuit, also brought by a single customer, was tried before a federal judge in New Jersey in February 2000. After trial, judgment was entered in favor of Iron
Mountain; no appeal was filed in this matter.

We
have denied liability and asserted affirmative defenses in all of the remaining cases arising out of the fires and, in certain of the cases, have asserted counterclaims for
indemnification against the plaintiffs. Discovery is ongoing. We deny any liability as a result of the destruction of, or damage to, customer records or property of abutters as a result of the fires,
which were beyond our control. We also deny any liability for the injuries allegedly sustained by the fire official. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these and any other lawsuits that
may arise.

We
were paid by our general liability and property insurance carrier for costs incurred as a result of business interruption and property damage due to the fires, and/or the related
defense cost of third party claims. However, our errors and omissions carrier made an initial determination denying coverage as to these third party claims. In November 1998, we filed an action
in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a declaration of coverage and other relief. The parties, together with the general liability and property carrier, have
entered into a settlement agreement regarding reimbursement of defense costs and agreed to ongoing discussions regarding any remaining coverage issues.

The
outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Based on our present assessment of the situation, after consultation with legal counsel, management does not believe
that the outcome of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, although there can be no assurance in this regard.

In
addition to the matters discussed above, we are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business with a portion of the defense and/or settlement costs being
covered by various commercial liability insurance policies purchased by us. In the opinion of management, no other material legal proceedings are pending to which we, or any of our properties, are
subject.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders of Iron Mountain during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001.


PART II

Item 5. Market for the Registrant's Common Stock and Related Shareholder Matters.

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "IRM." On December 5, 2001, our board authorized and approved a
three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a dividend on our common stock. We issued the additional shares of common stock resulting from this stock dividend on
December 31, 2001 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 17, 2001.

The
following table sets forth the high and low sale prices on the NYSE, for the years 2000 and 2001, giving effect to such stock split:

The
high and low sale prices on the NYSE for the first quarter of 2000 include only the months of February and March as our merger with Pierce Leahy occurred on February 1,
2000.

The
closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on March 1, 2002 was $31.02. As of March 1, 2002, there were 603 holders of record of our common stock. We believe that
there are more than 9,400 beneficial owners of our common stock.

Our
board currently intends to retain future earnings, if any, for the development of our businesses and does not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable
future. Future determinations by our board to pay cash dividends on our common stock would be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations and business requirements. Cash
dividends, if any, would be payable at the sole discretion of our board out of the funds legally available for that purpose. Some of our credit agreements and indentures contain provisions that limit
the amount of cash dividends we may pay and stock repurchases that we may make.

We
have not paid dividends on our common stock, other than stock dividends, during the last two years.

Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial and Operating Information.

The following selected consolidated statements of operations and balance sheet data have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. The
selected consolidated financial and operating information set forth below should be read in conjunction with "Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto included elsewhere in this filing.

On
December 5, 2001, our board authorized and approved a three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a dividend on our common stock. We issued the
additional shares of common stock resulting from this stock dividend on December 31, 2001 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 17, 2001. All accompanying
share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the stock split.

Adjusted
EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for extraordinary items, other income (expense), merger-related expenses, stock option compensation expense and minority interest. We use
Adjusted EBITDA as our internal measurement of financial performance and as the basis for allocating resources to our operating segments. In addition, substantially all of our financing agreements
contain covenants in which Adjusted EBITDA-based calculations are used as a measure of financial performance for financial ratio purposes. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA-based calculations are
used by the holders of our publicly issued debt as important criteria for evaluating our business and, as a result, all of our bond indentures contain covenants in


which
Adjusted EBITDA-based calculations are used as the primary measure of financial performance. However, you should not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA to be substitutes for operating or net
income (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) as indicators of our performance or for cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as
a measure of liquidity. See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for discussions of other measures of performance determined in accordance
with GAAP and our sources and applications of cash flow.

(2)

We
reported a loss from continuing operations before provision (benefit) for income taxes and minority interest for the years ended December 31, 1997, 2000 and 2001. We would
have needed to generate additional income from operations before provision for income taxes and minority interest of $4,601, $18,032 and $8,131 to cover our fixed charges of $37,489, $154,975 and
$177,032, respectively.

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial and Operating Information" and the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing.

This
discussion contains "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined in the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements concern our operations, economic
performance and financial condition. The forward-looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. When we use words such as "believes," "expects,"
"anticipates," "estimates" or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements.

Although
we believe that our forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from our
expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, among others:

•

the
cost and availability of appropriate storage facilities;

•

our
significant indebtedness and the cost and availability of financing for contemplated growth;

•

changes
in customer preferences and demand for our services;

•

rapid
and significant changes in technology;

•

uncertainties
related to international expansion;

•

difficulties
related to the integration of acquisitions;

•

uncertainties
related to expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and market acceptance of our products and services;

•

effects
of future changes in regulatory standards and requirements; and

•

other
general economic and business conditions.

Critical Accounting Policies

The following "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this filing,
are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the


financial statements and for the period then ended. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the estimates used, including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, impairments of
tangible and intangible assets, income taxes, purchase accounting related reserves, self-insurance liabilities, incentive compensation liabilities, litigation liabilities and
contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These
estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. We use these estimates to assist us in the
identification and assessment of the accounting treatment necessary with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

Accounting for Acquisitions

Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence
of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning, and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as
we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources.

Each
acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition, including, Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 16, "Accounting for Business Combinations", and more recently, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") 141, "Business Combinations." Accounting for these
acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets
acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment. These estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and
equipment, intangible assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. We
are not aware of any information that would indicate that the final purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in 2001 would differ meaningfully from preliminary estimates.

In
connection with each of our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings. Our restructuring
activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities, reductions in staffing levels, and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire. These activities are
included as costs of the acquisition and are recorded as goodwill consistent with the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95-3, "Recognition of Liabilities in
Connection with a Purchase Business Combination." While we finalize our plans to restructure the businesses we acquire within one year of the date of acquisition, it may take more than one year to
complete all activities related to the restructuring of an acquired business.

Our
acquisitions have resulted in a significant accumulation of goodwill which, for acquisitions prior to July 1, 2001, we amortized over an estimated benefit period of 20 to
30 years. We have not amortized any goodwill for our acquisitions completed after July 1, 2001 and will no longer amortize any goodwill beginning on January 1, 2002, in accordance
with SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". Through December 31, 2001, we reviewed our existing goodwill for impairment, consistent with the guidelines of SFAS 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" and determined that no amounts of goodwill were impaired using the undiscounted
future cash flow methodology of SFAS 121. Effective January 1, 2002, we will review goodwill for impairment consistent with the guidelines of SFAS 142 using a discounted future
cash flow approach. The methodology for determining impairment under SFAS 142 is significantly different and could result in different determinations than under SFAS 121. Pursuant to
SFAS 142, we will test our goodwill for impairment upon adoption and, if impairment is indicated, record such impairment as a cumulative effect of accounting change. We are currently evaluating
the effect that the adoption may have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.


Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments or disputes
with customers regarding payment terms. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables, current economic conditions, and
specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their
ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required.

Accounting for Synthetic Leases

We participate in several synthetic leasing programs that involve 30 of the 519 leased facilities that we occupy. Under these synthetic lease facilities, special
purpose entities are established to acquire properties and subsequently lease those properties to us. The leases are designed and qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes, where the monthly
lease expense is recorded as rent expense in our income statement. We do not consolidate the assets or liabilities related to these facilities in our consolidated financial statements.

Synthetic
lease facilities require the application of complex lease and special purpose entity accounting rules and interpretations. We are aware that the Financial Accounting Standards
Board is currently reviewing these accounting rules and interpretations and is considering their current and future application. In the course of applying these complex accounting rules and
interpretations, we have made certain judgments, estimates and assumptions relative to their treatment.

We
had properties in our synthetic lease facilities with a lessor's original cost of $74.3 million as of December 31, 2000. During 2001, we added 16 properties to our
synthetic lease program with an original cost of $77.6 million bringing the total original cost of properties in our synthetic lease program to $151.9 million as of December 31,
2001. If all of our synthetic leases were accounted for as capital leases rather than operating leases or if these special purpose entities were consolidated in our 2001 historical financial
statements: (1) our gross property, plant and equipment and long-term debt would each be increased in an amount equal to $151.9 million as of December 31, 2001;
(2) depreciation expense would increase in an amount equal to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 for the properties leased pursuant to the synthetic lease
facilities; and (3) rent expense for these properties
would be reclassified as interest expense in an amount equal to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Consequently, our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, operating income and
interest expense would have increased by $8.5 million, $8.5 million, $6.3 million and $8.5 million, respectively. In addition, net income before tax would have decreased by
$2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. See "—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Synthetic Leases."

We
believe that the following pro forma information will further assist in the understanding of this topic. If we had occupied all 30 properties on January 1, 2001 and all of our
synthetic leases were accounted for as capital leases rather than operating leases or if these special purpose entities were consolidated in our financial statements: (1) our gross property,
plant and equipment and long-term debt would each be increased in an amount equal to $151.9 million as of December 31, 2001; (2) depreciation expense would increase in
an amount equal to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 for the properties leased pursuant to the synthetic lease facilities; and (3) rent expense for these
properties would be reclassified as interest expense in an amount equal to $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Consequently, our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, operating income
and interest expense would have increased by $8.5 million, $8.5 million, $5.6 million and $11.4 million, respectively. In addition, net income before tax would have
decreased by $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.


Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

SFAS No. 133, "Accounting For Derivative Instruments And Hedging Activities", establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives), and for hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires an entity to recognize all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities on its balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (1) a
hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment; (2) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted
transaction; or (3) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an available-for-sale security, or a
foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized
and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives.

For
cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the
hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For hedges of foreign currency the accounting
treatment generally follows the treatment for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge.

In
order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The
effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are
recorded currently in earnings.

Although
we apply some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is
such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high. We had $10.1 million of interest rate risk management liabilities and had a
corresponding amount for unrealized losses to other comprehensive income ($6.1 million, net of tax) primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2001.

Accounting for Internal Use Software

We develop various software applications for internal use. We account for those costs in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position 98-1,
"Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use". SOP 98-1 requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be expensed as
incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. SOP 98-1 also defines which types of costs should be capitalized and which should be expensed. Payroll and related costs for
employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects to the extent time is spent directly on the project, are capitalized and
depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the project will be completed and
used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are evaluated for impairment in accordance with
SFAS 121.

It
may be necessary for us to write-off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. Our expansion into
new technology-based service offerings requires the development of internal use software that will be susceptible to rapid and


significant changes in technology. We may be required to write-off unamortized costs if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the
software's estimated useful life. General uncertainties related to expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and market acceptance of our services, may adversely impact
the recoverability of these assets.

Accounting for Investments

We hold investments in companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an
investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an
inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment's current carrying value, thereby possibly resulting in an impairment charge in the future.

Overview

Our primary financial objective has been to increase consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which is a source of funds for investment in continued growth and to
service indebtedness. We use Adjusted EBITDA as our internal measurement of financial performance and as the basis for allocating resources to our internal operating segments. In addition,
substantially all of our financing agreements contain covenants in which Adjusted EBITDA-based calculations are used as a measure of financial performance for financial ratio purposes. Adjusted EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA-based calculations are used by the holders of our publicly issued debt as important criteria for evaluating our business and, as a result, all of our bond indentures contain
covenants in which Adjusted EBITDA-based calculations are used as the primary measure of financial performance. However, you should not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA to be substitutes for
operating or net income (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) as indicators of our performance or for cash flow from operations (as determined in
accordance with GAAP) as a measure of liquidity.

We
have benefited from our growth in consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA has increased from $129.4 million for 1999 to $282.1 million for 2001 (a compound
annual growth rate of 47.7%). Adjusted EBITDA has increased from $129.7 million for 1999 to $302.2 million for 2001 (a compound annual growth rate of 52.7%). However, the focus on
generating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA has negatively affected other measures of our financial performance, such as consolidated net income.

For
the years ended December 31, 1999 through 2001, we experienced consolidated net losses of $14.2 million, $27.8 million and $44.1 million, respectively. We
attribute such losses in part to significant charges associated with the pursuit of our growth strategy, namely:

•

increases
in depreciation expense associated with expansion of storage capacity as well as development and acquisition of information systems assets;

•

increases
in goodwill amortization associated with acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method prior to July 1, 2001;

•

increases
in interest expense associated with the borrowings used to fund acquisitions;

•

in
2000, charges for non-cash stock option compensation expense and in 2000 and 2001, merger-related expenses, both primarily associated with the integration
of the operations of Iron Mountain and Pierce Leahy;


•

in
2001, extraordinary charges for early extinguishment of debt associated with the retirement of our 11


/


% senior subordinated notes due
2006 and 10


/


% senior subordinated notes due 2006, or the 11


/


% notes and the 10


/


% notes, respectively; and

•

in
2000 and 2001, non-cash foreign currency losses primarily due to a change in the value of the Canadian dollar as compared to the U.S. dollar,
as it relates to the U.S. dollar denominated debt and intercompany balances of our principal Canadian subsidiary.

Our
revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service and storage material sales revenues. Storage revenues consist of periodic charges related to the storage of materials (either
on a per unit or per cubic foot of records basis) and have accounted for approximately 60% of total revenues in each of the last five years. In certain circumstances, based upon customer requirements,
storage revenues include periodic charges associated with normal, recurring service activities. Service and storage material sales revenues are comprised of charges for related service activities and
courier operations and the sale of storage materials. Related service revenues arise from additions of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, destructions
of records, permanent withdrawals from storage and sales of specially designed storage containers, magnetic media including computer tapes and related supplies. Courier operations consist primarily of
the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request. Customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms.

Cost
of sales (excluding depreciation) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs, vehicle and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these,
wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing
personnel, as well as
expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies.

Our
depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital-intensive nature of our business and the acquisitions we have completed. The principal components of
depreciation relate to storage systems and related equipment, new buildings and leasehold improvements, equipment for new facilities and computer system hardware and software. Amortization relates
primarily to goodwill arising from acquisitions and customer acquisition costs. We have accounted for all of our acquisitions under the purchase method. Since the purchase price for companies in our
industry is usually substantially in excess of the fair value of their net assets, these purchases have given rise to significant goodwill and, accordingly, significant levels of amortization.
Although amortization is a non-cash charge, it does decrease reported consolidated net income. Because certain of our acquisitions have given rise to nondeductible goodwill, our effective
tax rate historically has been higher than the statutory rate. See "—Recent Pronouncements."

We
acquired 17 businesses in 1999, 12 in 2000 and 16 in 2001. With the exception of the Pierce Leahy merger in 2000, most acquisitions had lower Adjusted EBITDA margins than the rest of
our business. We generally do not realize anticipated synergies relating to acquisitions immediately. We were able to increase our recent Adjusted EBITDA margins through improved overall operating
efficiencies, economies of scale and the realization of synergies in connection with earlier acquisitions, as well as the addition of the higher-margin Pierce Leahy business in 2000. This increase was
partially offset by additional labor expense due to wage and incentive compensation equalization in conjunction with the Pierce Leahy integration. As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated
Adjusted EBITDA margins were 25.0% for 1999, 26.1% for 2000 and 25.8% for 2001. Included in Adjusted EBITDA for 2001 is $5.4 million (0.5% of consolidated revenue) of development expenses for
our new technology-based services.


On
December 5, 2001, our board authorized and approved a three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a dividend on our common stock. We issued the
additional shares of common stock on December 31, 2001 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 17, 2001. All share and per share amounts have been restated
to reflect the stock split.

Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2000

Consolidated revenues increased $184.7 million, or 18.7%, to $1,171.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $986.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2000. Internal revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 10.5%, comprised of 11.1% for storage revenue and 9.5% for service and storage
material sales revenues. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations and as if Pierce Leahy had merged with us on January 1, 2000.


Consolidated
storage revenues increased $108.8 million, or 18.6%, to $694.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $585.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to: (1) internal revenue growth of 11.1% resulting primarily from net increases in records and other media stored by
existing customers and sales to new customers; and (2) acquisitions, particularly the inclusion of Pierce Leahy's revenue for twelve months of 2001 versus eleven months of 2000. The total
increase in storage revenues was partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation of $3.8 million as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain
currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar and the British pound sterling.

Consolidated
service and storage material sales revenues increased $75.9 million, or 19.0%, to $476.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from
$400.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to: (1) internal revenue growth of 9.5% resulting primarily from net increases in
service and storage material sales to existing customers and sales to new customers; and (2) acquisitions, particularly the inclusion of Pierce Leahy's revenue for twelve months of 2001 versus
eleven months of 2000. The total increase in service and storage material sales revenues was partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation of $3.3 million as a
result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies during 2001, primarily the Canadian dollar and the British pound sterling.

Consolidated
cost of sales (excluding depreciation) increased $79.2 million, or 16.4%, to $561.9 million (48.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2001 from $482.8 million (48.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to the required costs
to support our revenue growth and was partially offset by operating efficiencies at our U.S. and Canadian operations, particularly related to the decrease in rent as a percent of consolidated revenue
of 0.7% offset by a 0.2% increase in other facilities costs as a percent of consolidated revenues and a 0.2% increase in utility expenses (primarily, gas and oil charges) as a percent of consolidated
revenues. In our U.S. and Canadian operations, facility costs increased $22.1 million and labor costs increased $33.7 million, which represented a decrease of 0.3% and 0.8% of
consolidated revenues, respectively. The decrease as a percent of consolidated revenues was offset by relatively lower gross margins in our emerging confidential destruction services business, which
increased cost of sales by 0.9% of consolidated revenues.

Consolidated
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $60.4 million, or 24.5%, to $306.9 million (26.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2001 from $246.6 million (25.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to the required costs
to support our revenue growth, while the increase as a percent of consolidated revenues was primarily attributable to: (1) higher overhead levels in our emerging confidential destruction
services business (an increase of 0.6% of consolidated revenue) and our Latin American and European operations (an increase of 0.4% of consolidated revenue); (2) higher data communications
costs resulting from network deployment and migration activities (an increase of 0.4% of consolidated revenues); and (3) expenditures for our marketing and information technology initiatives
related to the development of complementary technology-based service offerings (an increase of 0.5% of consolidated revenues). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the provision for
doubtful accounts for our U.S. and Canadian operations (a decrease of 0.4% of consolidated revenues).

Consolidated
depreciation and amortization expense increased $26.8 million, or 21.1%, to $153.6 million (13.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2001 from $126.8 million (12.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. Depreciation expense increased $20.3 million, primarily due to
the additional depreciation expense related to the 2000 and 2001 acquisitions, particularly the inclusion of Pierce Leahy's depreciation expense for twelve months of 2001 versus eleven months of 2000
and capital expenditures including storage systems, information systems and expansion of storage capacity in existing facilities. Amortization expense


increased $6.4 million, primarily due to the additional amortization expense related to the goodwill generated by our 2000 and 2001 acquisitions completed prior to July 1, 2001,
particularly Pierce Leahy.

Stock
option compensation expense of $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 represents a non-cash charge resulting from the acceleration and
extension of previously granted stock options as a part of separation agreements with certain executives. There were no such costs for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Merger-related
expenses are certain expenses directly related to our merger with Pierce Leahy that cannot be capitalized and include system conversion costs, costs of exiting certain
facilities, severance, relocation and pay-to-stay payments and other transaction-related costs. Merger-related expenses were $3.7 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues)
for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $9.1 million (0.9% of consolidated revenues) for the same period of 2000.

As
a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $39.0 million, or 36.8%, to $145.0 million (12.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2001 from $106.0 million (10.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000.

Consolidated
interest expense increased $16.8 million, or 14.2%, to $134.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $118.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to increased indebtedness related to: (1) $19.6 million of interest expense on the 8


/


% senior
subordinated notes due 2013, or the 8


/


% notes, which were issued in April and September 2001; (2) the inclusion of term debt related to our credit facility for twelve
months versus five months of 2000 resulting in an increase of $6.2 million; and (3) the inclusion of Pierce Leahy's debt for twelve months of 2001 versus eleven months of 2000 resulting
in an increase of $4.7 million. These increases were partially offset by reduced interest expense of $11.8 million due to the retirement of our 11


/


% and


/


% senior subordinated notes as well as a decline in the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt.

Consolidated
other expense was $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The change
was partially due to a $6.9 million impairment charge taken on our investment in convertible preferred stock of a technology development
company. Additionally, we recorded a non-cash foreign currency loss of $10.4 million, primarily due to the effect of further weakening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar
for the year ended December 31, 2001, versus the same period of 2000, as it relates to Iron Mountain Canada Corporation's 8


/


% senior notes due 2008, or the 8


/


%
notes, and the intercompany balances with our Canadian and European subsidiaries. In 2000, this amount was $6.3 million.

As
a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated loss before provision for income taxes and minority interests decreased $9.9 million to $8.1 million (0.7% of
consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $18.0 million (1.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. The provision for income taxes
was $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we
recorded approximately $38.9 million of nondeductible goodwill amortization expense.

Consolidated
loss before extraordinary item increased $7.3 million to $32.2 million (2.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 from
$24.9 million (2.5% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. In 2001, we recorded an extraordinary charge of $11.8 million (net of tax benefit of
$8.2 million) related to the early retirement of our 11


/


% and 10


/


% notes in conjunction with our underwritten public offerings of the 8


/


%
notes. In 2000, we recorded an extraordinary charge of $2.9 million (net of tax benefit of $1.9 million) related to the early extinguishment of debt in conjunction with the refinancing
of our senior credit facility. The charges


primarily represented call and tender premiums and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the extinguished debt.

As
a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased $45.2 million, or 17.6%, to $302.2 million (25.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2001 from $257.0 million (26.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. Excluding the $5.4 million of expenses (0.5% of consolidated
revenues) related to the development of our new technology-related service offerings, our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 26.3% of consolidated revenues. There
were no such costs in the same period of 2000.

Adjusted
EBITDA as a percent of segment revenue for our business records management segment decreased from 27.4% to 26.8%, primarily due to: (1) increases in cost of sales
associated with other facility costs, including utilities and property insurance; (2) increases in selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of divisionalization;
(3) higher data communications costs resulting from network deployment and migration activities; and (4) an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts. This decrease was partially
offset by increases in gross margin driven by real estate management and labor efficiencies obtained as a result of an increase in scale.

Adjusted
EBITDA as a percent of segment revenue for our off-site data protection segment increased from 25.2% to 26.1% primarily due to an increase in gross margin as a
result of improved labor, transportation and real estate management, as well as the contribution from the segment's acquisition
of two higher margin escrow businesses. This increase was partially offset by: (1) the decentralization of various overhead functions; (2) an increase in spending for sales and
marketing; and (3) a decrease in contribution from the segment's higher margin complementary services due to the relatively slower growth in revenue for those services.

The
Adjusted EBITDA margin for our international segment increased from 20.5% to 23.7% primarily due to: (1) the inclusion of an additional month in 2001 of our more profitable
Canadian business acquired as a part of the Pierce Leahy acquisition; (2) efficiency gains from the economies of scale achieved through the December 2000 acquisition of FACS Record
Centre Inc., a Canadian company; and (3) improved margins from our Latin American operations. This increase was partially offset by an increase of $0.7 million in the provision for
doubtful accounts at our European operations.

Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999

Consolidated revenues increased $466.9 million, or 89.9%, to $986.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $519.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 1999. Total internal revenue growth, calculated as if Pierce Leahy had merged with Iron Mountain on January 1, 1999, was 12.3%.

Consolidated
storage revenues increased $268.3 million, or 84.5%, to $585.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $317.4 million for the year
ended December 31,1999. Consolidated storage revenues increased primarily due to acquisitions, particularly the Pierce Leahy acquisition. Pierce Leahy's 1999 storage revenues were
$190.1 million. Internal storage revenue growth, calculated as if Pierce Leahy had merged with Iron Mountain on January 1, 1999, was 11.7%. The internal storage revenue growth resulted
primarily from net increases in records and other media stored by existing customers and from sales to new customers.

Consolidated
service and storage material sales revenues increased $198.5 million, or 98.2%, to $400.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from
$202.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Consolidated service and storage material sales revenues increased primarily due to acquisitions, particularly the Pierce Leahy
acquisition. Pierce Leahy's 1999 service and storage material sales revenues were $152.2 million. Internal service and storage material sales revenue growth, calculated as if Pierce Leahy had
merged with Iron Mountain on January 1, 1999, was 13.3%. The internal revenue growth resulted from increases in service and storage material sales to existing customers and the addition of new
customer accounts.


Consolidated cost of sales (excluding depreciation) increased $221.9 million, or 85.0%, to $482.8 million (48.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2000 from $260.9 million (50.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 1999. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of
Pierce Leahy. The decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to operating efficiencies, particularly related to labor and transportation, gained as a result of an increase in
scale, offset by the increased facilities costs of Pierce Leahy, which are typical of a more paper storage-intensive business. Our business records management and international segments are
substantially paper-based. Revenues for these segments have increased from 73% to 80% of total revenues from 1999 to 2000.

Consolidated
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $117.7 million, or 91.2%, to $246.6 million (25.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2000 from $128.9 million (24.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 1999. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to the Pierce Leahy
acquisition. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to increased spending on information technology related to: (1) the conversion of new systems for our
off-site data protection business; (2) increased staffing in preparation for systems conversions related to the integration of Pierce Leahy with us; and (3) our efforts to
explore complementary digital service offerings. These increases were partially offset by general management overhead efficiencies driven by an increase in scale.

Consolidated
depreciation and amortization expense increased $61.4 million, or 93.8%, to $126.8 million (12.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2000 from $65.4 million (12.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 1999. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to the additional
depreciation and amortization expense related to the 1999 and 2000 acquisitions, particularly the Pierce Leahy acquisition, and capital expenditures including racking systems, information systems and
expansion of storage capacity in existing facilities.

Stock
option compensation expense represents a non-cash charge resulting from the acceleration of vesting and extension of exercise periods for previously granted stock
options as a part of separation agreements with certain executives relating to the Pierce Leahy merger. Stock option compensation expense was $15.1 million (1.6% of consolidated revenues) for
the year ended December 31, 2000.

Merger-related
expenses are certain expenses directly related to our merger with Pierce Leahy that cannot be capitalized and include severance, relocation and
pay-to-stay payments, costs of exiting certain facilities, system conversion costs and other transaction-related costs. Merger-related expenses were $9.1 million (0.9%
of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000.

As
a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $41.8 million, or 65.0%, to $106.0 million (10.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2000 from $64.2 million (12.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 1999.

Consolidated
interest expense increased $63.6 million, or 116.8%, to $118.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $54.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999. The increase was primarily attributable to increased indebtedness related to: (1) the debt assumed as a result of the Pierce Leahy acquisition; (2) the
financing of acquisitions and capital expenditures; (3) the increase in our effective interest rate from the same period in 1999; and (4) our debt refinancing on August 14, 2000,
resulting in additional principal outstanding and additional commitment fees, which were only partially offset by interest earned on excess cash.

Consolidated
other income (expense) was an expense of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to income of $0.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999. The increase in expense was primarily due to a weakening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, as it relates to the 8


/


% notes, and a weakening of
the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar on intercompany balances with our European subsidiaries.


As
a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and minority interests decreased $27.8 million to a
loss of $18.0 million (1.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000 from income of $9.8 million (1.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 1999. The provision for income taxes was $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to $10.6 million for the year ended December 31,
1999. Our effective tax rate is higher than statutory rates primarily due to the amortization of the nondeductible portion of goodwill associated with certain acquisitions (the tax laws generally
permit deduction of such expenses for asset purchases, but not for acquisitions of stock). For the year ended December 31, 2000, we recorded approximately $35 million in nondeductible
goodwill amortization expense.

Consolidated
loss from continuing operations increased $23.8 million to $24.9 million (2.5% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000 from
$1.1 million (0.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 1999.

In
addition, in August 2000, we recorded an extraordinary charge of $2.9 million (net of tax benefit of $1.9 million) related to the early extinguishment of debt in
conjunction with the refinancing of our senior credit facility. The charge primarily represented the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the extinguished
debt.

As
a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated net loss increased $13.6 million, or 95.7%, to $27.8 million (2.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2000 from $14.2 million (2.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 1999.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Recent Financings, Sources of Funds and Long-term Obligations

In April 2001, we completed an underwritten public offering of $225.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8


/


% notes. The


/


% notes were issued at a price to investors of 100% of par. Our net proceeds of $218.6 million, after paying the underwriters' discounts and commissions and related expenses,
were used to fund our offer to purchase and consent solicitation relating to our outstanding 11


/


% notes, to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for
general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.

In
April 2001, we received and accepted tenders for $124.6 million of the outstanding principal amount of our 11


/


% notes. We recorded an extraordinary
charge of $4.8 million (net of tax benefit of $3.3 million) in the second quarter related to the early retirement of the 11


/


% notes. Subsequently, we redeemed the
remaining $5.4 million of principal amount of the 11


/


% notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 105.563% plus accrued and unpaid
interest, for a total cost of redemption of $6.0 million.

In
September 2001, we completed an underwritten public offering which resulted in the issuance of an additional $210.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our


/


% notes. The additional notes were issued at a price to investors of 101.50% of par. Our net proceeds of $209.3 million, after paying the underwriters' discounts and
commissions and related expenses, were used to fund our offer to purchase and consent solicitation relating to our outstanding 10


/


% notes and to redeem the remaining


/


% notes, as well as to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.

In
September 2001, we received and accepted tenders for $156.7 million of the $165.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 10


/


%
notes. We recorded an extraordinary charge of $7.0 million (net of tax benefit of $4.9 million) in the third quarter related to the early retirement of the 10


/


% notes.
Subsequently, we received and accepted tenders for an additional $0.3 million in aggregate principal
amount of our 10


/


% notes and redeemed the remaining $8.0 million of outstanding principal amount of our 10


/


% notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a
percentage of principal amount) of 105.06% plus accrued and unpaid interest, for a total cost of redemption of $9.0 million.

On
March 15, 2002, we entered into a new amended and restated revolving credit agreement (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement"). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
replaces our existing credit agreement. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement has an aggregate principal amount of $650.0 million and includes a $400.0 million revolving credit
facility and a term loan facility in the amount of $250.0 million. The revolving credit facility matures on January 31, 2005 while the term loan is to be paid in full on
February 15, 2008; however, if our 9


/


% senior subordinated notes due 2007, or the 9


/


% notes, are not redeemed or repurchased prior to April 15, 2007 the
term loan will mature on April 15, 2007. The interest rate on borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of base rates and currency options, plus
an applicable margin. This margin applicable to the term loans under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is lower than the margin applicable to such loans under our existing credit agreement and
will result in reduced interest expense on our borrowings as compared to the previous credit agreement. Restrictive covenants under this agreement are similar to those under our prior credit facility.
All intercompany notes are now pledged to secure the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $134.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, consisting primarily of net proceeds of $427.9 million from the
sale of the 8


/


% notes and equity


contributions from minority shareholders of $24.8 million, partially offset by the early retirement of the 11


/


% notes and the 10


/


% notes of
$312.7 million.

Net
cash provided by continuing operations was $160.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $157.6 million for the same period in 2000. The
increase was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income and trade payables, partially offset by an increase in trade accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and a decrease in accrued
expenses.

At
December 31, 2001, we had estimated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $173 million for federal income tax purposes. As a result of such loss
carryforwards, cash paid for income taxes has historically been substantially lower than the provision for income taxes. The preceding net operating loss carryforwards do not include approximately
$79 million of potential preacquisition net operating loss carryforwards of Arcus Group, Inc. and certain other foreign acquisitions. Any tax benefit realized related to preacquisition
net operating loss carryforwards will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill when, and if, realized. The Arcus Group carryforwards expire in seven years. As a result of these loss carryforwards, we do
not expect to pay any significant federal and state income taxes in the next three years.

As
of December 31, 2001, the annual maturities of our indebtedness for the years ending December 31, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 were $35.3 million,
$10.3 million, $5.1 million, $298.1 million and
$54.6 million, respectively. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. None of our public debt is subject to scheduled mandatory redemption before 2006.

As
of December 31, 2001, the minimum future payments under our operating leases for the years ending December 31, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 were
$123.6 million, $111.4 million, $100.4 million, $86.3 million and $68.6 million, respectively. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As
of February 28, 2002, we had approximately $1,508.9 million of total debt, of which $1,317.8 million or 87.3% of total debt, including the $195.5 million
of debt subject to the interest rate swap agreements (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), had fixed interest rates and $191.1 million had variable interest rates.

Capital Investments

As we have sought to increase our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, we have made significant capital investments, consisting primarily of: (i) the purchase and
construction of real estate; (ii) other capital expenditures; (iii) acquisitions; and (iv) customer acquisition costs. These investments have been primarily funded through cash
flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities.

During
2001, total capital expenditures were $197.0 million. A significant portion of our capital expenditures are related to growth and consist primarily of storage systems,
management information systems, new buildings and expansion of storage capacity in existing facilities. Approximately 10% of total capital expenditures were expended in order to maintain our then
current revenue stream. We currently estimate that our capital expenditures (other than capital expenditures related to future acquisitions, which cannot be presently estimated, and our digital
services offerings, which are described separately below) for 2002 will be approximately $175 to $200 million. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash flows from operations and
borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

Cash
paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in 2001 was $71.4 million. In addition, in 2001, we incurred costs (net of revenues received for the initial transfer of records)
related to the acquisition of large volume accounts (customer acquisition costs) of $8.4 million.


We have been assessing various opportunities in the technology-based services business driven by e-commerce and facilitated by the Internet. Services associated with this
business would expand our range of services into the use of the Internet to facilitate the backup, storage and management of customer data. We estimate that we will incur expenses associated with the
continuing development of our digital service offerings in the range of $7 million to $9 million during 2002. In addition, we expect the capital expenditures associated with the
continuing development of our digital service offerings in 2002 will be in the range of $5 million to $6 million. We intend to fund this effort with cash flows from operations and
borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

Synthetic Leasing

Our synthetic leases contain financial and other covenants, and events of default, that are similar to those contained in our Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement. Seven financial institutions have provided over 50% of the capacity under our $400.0 million revolving credit facility. These seven financial institutions also participate in our
synthetic lease programs. An event of default under one of our synthetic lease facilities would result in an event of default under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, enabling the lenders
under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to terminate their commitments to lend and accelerate our obligations thereunder. An event of default under one of our synthetic lease facilities would
not, directly, result in an event of default under any indenture pursuant to which our publicly traded notes were issued. However, an acceleration of our obligations under our Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement would result in an event of default under each indenture, thereby enabling the holders of such notes to accelerate our obligations under the applicable indenture.

Under
our synthetic lease facilities, special purpose entities are established to acquire properties and subsequently lease those properties to us. Neither we nor any of our related
parties have invested, either via debt obligations or equity, in these special purpose entities. Our obligations under our synthetic lease facilities are considered indebtedness for purposes of
financial covenants under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2001, our synthetic leasing program had a total capacity of $204.3 of which $151.9 million had
been utilized for property acquisitions and $52.4 million is currently available for future property acquisitions.

We
have entered into these synthetic leases because we believe they afford meaningful benefits. Such benefits include rental payments below those available from traditional landlords and
developers, and tax benefits and control provisions normally associated with direct ownership. Each of the leases under our synthetic lease facilities has a five to six and one-half year term for
specified records storage
warehouses; commencement dates for these leases range from 1998 to 2002. During 2001, we recorded $8.5 million in rent expense on our income statement related to these lease commitments. We had
synthetic lease facilities related to properties with a lessor's original cost of $74.3 million and $151.9 million as of December 31, 2000 and December 31, 2001,
respectively. If on January 1, 2001, the original cost of properties under synthetic lease facilities had equaled $151.9 million, rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2001
would have been approximately $11.4 million. See "—Critical Accounting Policies—Accounting for Synthetic Leases." At the end of each lease term, we, at our option, may:
(1) negotiate a renewal of such lease (which is subject to the agreement of the relevant synthetic lease lessor and its lenders); (2) purchase the properties subject to such lease at a
price equal to the lessor's original cost; or (3) allow such lease to expire and cause the properties subject to it to be sold. Our ability to cause the properties to be sold depends upon our
compliance with certain terms of the applicable lease. Under certain conditions, we would receive the excess, if any, of the net sales proceeds over the properties' original cost. In the event that
the net sales proceeds are less than the properties' original cost, we would make certain contingent rental payments to the lessor equal to that difference, subject to a maximum amount of
approximately 85% of the properties' original cost. If any of our synthetic lease facilities are terminated following an event of default under the relevant synthetic


lease documents, or if, at the end of the lease term, we do not either negotiate a renewal of the lease or elect to cause the relevant leased properties to be sold, or if we do elect to cause such
leased properties to be sold but fail to satisfy the conditions to such election, we would generally be obligated to pay the lessor's original cost for such leased properties.

Acquisitions

Our liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our acquisition strategy. Our future interest expense may increase significantly as a result of the
additional indebtedness we may incur to finance possible future acquisitions. To the extent that future acquisitions are financed by additional borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement or other credit facilities, or the future issuance of debt securities, the resulting increase in debt and interest expense could have a negative effect on such measures of liquidity as the
ratio of debt to equity, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to debt and to interest expense.

We
have historically financed the cash portion of our acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facilities in conjunction with cash flows provided by operations and with
the net proceeds from the issuance of debt securities and common stock.

In
connection with our acquisition program, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses. We complete formalized restructuring plans for acquisitions within one
year of the date of acquisition. The restructuring activities include reductions in staffing levels, elimination of duplicate facilities and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of
the acquired businesses. In connection with these restructuring activities, we established reserves of $3.8 million in 2001 as part of the purchase accounting for our acquisitions. During 2001,
we expended $7.8 million for restructuring costs. These expenditures consisted primarily of severance costs and costs related to exiting facilities. In addition, we made $8.2 million of
adjustments, which reduced goodwill, primarily as a result of our
finalization of certain restructuring plans. At December 31, 2001, we had a total of $16.2 million accrued for restructuring costs for all of our then completed acquisitions. See
Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

From
January 1, 2002 through March 1, 2002, we acquired 2 confidential destruction services businesses for aggregate consideration of approximately $8 million.

Iron Mountain/Pierce Leahy Integration

The process of integrating the operations and headquarters functions of Iron Mountain and Pierce Leahy includes the planning, development and execution of an
integration plan with the goal of full integration within three years after the merger. During 2000 and 2001, we completed the integration of the sales, overhead and support functions, and combined
the two field operations. We currently estimate that the merger-related expenses to integrate the two companies, the majority of which have been incurred in 2000 and 2001, will total approximately
$15 million. These costs consisted primarily of severance and relocation payments to certain employees, transition bonuses, consultants' fees, and system conversion costs. We recorded
merger-related expenses of $9.1 million and $3.7 million during 2000 and 2001. As a result of the integration effort, we expect to realize an estimated $15 million in annual
operating cost savings within three years after the merger. These cost savings will result primarily from the elimination of redundant corporate expenses, more efficient operations, and utilization of
real estate. We intend to fund the integration effort with cash flows from operations and borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

Future Capital Needs

Over the last year, our focus has shifted from growth through acquisitions to internally generated revenue growth. However, our primary financial goal has always
been, and continues to be, to increase


consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in relation to capital invested, even now that our focus has shifted from growth through acquisitions to internal revenue growth. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
are sources of funds for investment in continued growth and for servicing indebtedness.

Our
ability to generate sufficient cash to fund our needs depends generally on the results of our operations and the availability of financing. We believe that cash flows from operations
in conjunction with borrowings from existing and possible future debt financings will be sufficient to meet debt service requirements for the foreseeable future and to make possible future
acquisitions and capital expenditures. However, there can be no assurance in this regard or that the terms available for any future financing, if required, would be favorable to us.

Seasonality

Historically, our businesses have not been subject to seasonality in any material respect.

Inflation

Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, occupancy, costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although
to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long-term real estate leases, we can give no
assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

We generally view our investments in foreign businesses with a functional currency other than our reporting currency as long-term. These investments
are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are principally Canadian dollar, the British pound sterling, the Euro and
several Latin American currencies. The effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items" component
of shareholders' equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2001 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a $12.2 million reduction in our shareholders'
equity.

Recent Pronouncements

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Under
SFAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized, but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. At December 31, 2001, we had net goodwill of
$1.5 billion. Pursuant to SFAS 142, we will test our goodwill for impairment upon adoption and, if impairment is indicated, record such impairment as a cumulative effect of accounting
change. We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption may have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. The amortization provisions of SFAS 142 apply to goodwill
and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001. With respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, we are required to adopt SFAS 142 effective
January 1, 2002. Our impairment review may result in future periodic writedowns; however, the application of the non-amortization provisions of SFAS 142 for goodwill is
expected to result in an increase in operating income of approximately $59 million in 2002. We are also reviewing the estimated useful lives of intangible assets which may affect operating
income in 2002.


Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.

In December 2000 and January 2001, we entered into certain derivative financial contracts, which are variable-for-fixed
swaps of interest payments payable on an aggregate principal amount of $195.5 million of our term loan and certain variable operating lease commitments.

Our
investments in Iron Mountain Europe Limited, Iron Mountain South America, Ltd. and other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties relating to
fluctuations in currency valuation. One of our Canadian subsidiaries, Iron Mountain Canada Corporation, has U.S. dollar denominated debt. Gains and losses due to exchange rate fluctuations related to
this debt are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.

After
consideration of the swap contracts mentioned above, as of December 31, 2001, we had $180.6 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable
interest rate of 4.4%, and $1,315.5 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, such increase would
have had a negative impact on our net income for the year ended December 31, 2001 of $1.2 million. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our
long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2001.

of $46.858, and ten percent annual growth results in a Common Stock price per share of $74.613, respectively, for such term. The actual value, if any, an executive may realize will depend on the
excess of the market price of the Common Stock over the exercise price on the date the option is exercised. There is no assurance that the value realized by an executive will be at or near the amounts
reflected in this table.

Director Compensation

Directors who are employees of the Company do not receive additional compensation for serving as Directors. Each Director who is not an employee of the Company
receives an annual retainer fee of $12,000 as compensation for his services as a member of the Company Board and $500 for attendance at committee meetings ($1,000 per meeting for the Chairman of the
committee). In addition, the Company has a program by which it grants its nonemployee Directors options to purchase $200,000 of the Company's Common Stock every three years. Each option is granted
under either the Iron Mountain Incorporated 1995 Stock Incentive Plan or the Iron Mountain Incorporated 1997 Stock Option Plan (the "Stock Incentive Plan" and the "Stock Option Plan," respectively),
has an exercise price equal to fair market value (as defined in the Stock Incentive Plan or the Stock Option Plan, as applicable) on the date of grant, vests in equal amounts over a period of three
years and has a ten year term. All Directors are reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings of the Company Board or committees thereof, and for other

Company is a party to a merger or consolidation (whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation) in any transaction or series of related transactions and there is a "Limited Change of
Control" of the Company. A Limited Change of Control occurs if after the merger or consolidation (a) individuals who immediately prior to the merger or consolidation served as members of the
Company Board no longer constitute a majority of the Company Board or the board of directors of the surviving corporation and (b) the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately
prior to the merger or consolidation do not represent (either by remaining outstanding or upon conversion into securities of the surviving corporation) more than 50% of the voting power of the
securities of the Company or the surviving corporation immediately after the merger or consolidation.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.

Real Estate Transactions

Schooner leases space from the Company at the Company's corporate headquarters. Vincent J. Ryan, a Director of the Company, is the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of Schooner. The lease is a tenancy-at-will and may be terminated by either the Company or by Schooner at any time. As consideration for the lease, Schooner pays rent
to the Company based on its pro rata share of all expenses related to the use and occupancy of the premises. The rent paid by Schooner to the Company under such lease was approximately $101,000 in the
year ended December 31, 2001, and Schooner currently pays annual rent of approximately $109,000. The Company believes that the terms of this lease are no less favorable to it than would have
been negotiated with an unrelated third party.

The
Company leases from three separate limited partnerships certain of its facilities in Suffield, Connecticut, Orlando, Florida and Charlotte, North Carolina. J. Peter Pierce, a
Director of the Company, is the general partner of the limited partnerships, and members of the Pierce family and their affiliates own substantial limited partnership interests in each of the limited
partnerships. The


leases for the Suffield and Orlando facilities terminate on December 31, 2005 and January 3, 2006, respectively. The lease for the Charlotte facility was renewed during 2001 for a term
expiring on September 30, 2011. Each of the leases for the Suffield and Orlando facilities contain two five-year renewal options. The aggregate rental payment by the Company under
these leases during 2001 was $513,000. The Company believes that the terms of these leases are no less favorable to the Company than would have been negotiated with unrelated third parties.

Other Transactions

We paid compensation of approximately $230,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 to Mr. T. Anthony Ryan. Mr. Ryan is Vice President, Real
Estate, of the Company and is the brother of Vincent J. Ryan, a Director of the Company. We believe that the terms of Mr. Ryan's employment are no less favorable to it than would be negotiable
with an unrelated third party.

We
provided an annual pension in the amount of $96,000 to Leo W. Pierce, Sr. for the year ended December 31, 2001. Mr. Pierce formerly served as Chairman Emeritus of the
Company and is the father of J. Peter Pierce, a Director of the Company. We will continue to provide a pension to Mr. Pierce in 2002.

3-for-2 stock split effected in the form of a dividend on the Company's Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, and to file pro forma information for the nine months ended

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors of

Iron Mountain Incorporated:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Iron Mountain Incorporated (a Pennsylvania corporation) and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and comprehensive loss and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial
statements are the responsibility of Iron Mountain Incorporated's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the
consolidated financial statements of Iron Mountain Europe Limited as of October 31, 2000 and 2001, which statements reflect total assets and total revenues of 6 percent and
5 percent in 2000, and 8 percent and 6 percent in 2001, respectively, of the related consolidated totals. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been
furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for this entity, is based solely on the report of the other auditors.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Iron
Mountain Incorporated and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2001

(In thousands, except share data)

1. Nature of Business

The accompanying financial statements represent the consolidated accounts of Iron Mountain Incorporated, a Pennsylvania corporation, and its subsidiaries
(collectively "Iron Mountain" or the "Company"). Iron Mountain is an international full-service provider of records and information management and related services for all media in various
locations throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, Mexico and South America to Fortune 500 companies and numerous legal, banking, health care, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government
organizations.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

a.    Principles
of Consolidation

The
accompanying financial statements reflect the financial position and results of operations of Iron Mountain on a consolidated basis. All significant intercompany account balances
have been eliminated.

b.    Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an
on-going basis, the Company evaluates the estimates used, including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, impairments of tangible and intangible assets, income taxes,
purchase accounting related reserves, self-insurance liabilities, incentive compensation liabilities, litigation liabilities and contingencies. The Company bases its estimates on
historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and they are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company uses these estimates to assist in the identification and assessment of
the accounting treatment necessary with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

c.    Cash
and Cash Equivalents

The
Company defines cash and cash equivalents to include cash on hand and cash invested in short-term securities which have original maturities at the date of purchase of
less than 90 days. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

d.    Foreign
Currency Translation

Local
currencies are considered the functional currencies for most of the Company's operations outside the United States. All assets and liabilities are translated at
year-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation." Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders' equity. The gain or loss on
foreign currency transactions, including those


related to U.S. dollar denominated 8


/


% senior notes of the Company's Canadian subsidiary and those related to the foreign currency denominated intercompany obligation of the
Company's foreign subsidiaries to the Company totaled $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, and is included in Other Income (Expense), net, on the Company's Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

e.    Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

Effective
January 1, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133 requires
that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in the recognition of a
derivative liability and a corresponding transition adjustment charge to accumulated other comprehensive items of approximately $214 as of December 31, 2001.

Periodically,
the Company acquires derivative instruments that are intended to hedge either cash flows or values which are subject to exchange or other market price risk, and not for
trading purposes. The Company has formally documented its hedging relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedge items, as well as its risk management objectives and
strategies for undertaking each hedge transaction.

The
Company has entered into three interest rate swap agreements, which are derivatives as defined by SFAS No. 133 and designated as cash flow hedges. These swap agreements hedge
interest rate risk on certain amounts of its Tranche B debt as well as certain variable operating lease commitments. For all qualifying and highly effective cash flow hedges, the changes in the fair
value of the derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income. As a result of these interest rate swap agreements, the Company has recorded a derivative liability of and a corresponding charge
to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $9,857 ($5,857, net of tax) for the year ended December 31, 2001.

For
the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded net losses of $2,677 resulting from interest rate swap settlements in interest, and $743 in rent expense. All interest
rate swap agreements were determined to be highly effective whereby no ineffectiveness was recorded in earnings.

f.      Property,
Plant and Equipment

Property,
plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method with the following useful lives:

Buildings

40 to 50 years

Leasehold improvements

8 to 10 years or the life of the lease, whichever is shorter

Racking

5 to 20 years

Warehouse equipment/vehicles

4 to 20 years

Furniture and fixtures

3 to 10 years

Computer hardware and software

3 to 5 years


Property,
plant and equipment consist of the following:

$

984,939

$

1,190,537

Minor
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Major improvements which extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or the efficiency of property owned are
capitalized. Major improvements to leased buildings are capitalized as leasehold improvements and depreciated.

The
Company develops various software applications for internal use. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the development of
internal-use computer software projects (to the extent of the time spent directly on the project) are capitalized and depreciated over the useful life of the software. Capitalization
begins when the design stage of the application has been completed, it is probable that the project will be completed and the application will be used to perform the function intended. Depreciation
begins when the software is placed in service.

Effective
January 1, 1999, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Position 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use" ("SOP 98-1"). SOP 98-1 requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are
met. SOP 98-1 also defines which types of costs should be capitalized and which should be expensed. This accounting pronouncement resulted in certain costs being expensed starting in 1999
that would have been capitalized under the previous policy. The computer software costs incurred and capitalized prior to adoption of SOP 98-1 are being depreciated over their useful lives
or the useful lives of the related assets, and are evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of".

g.    Goodwill

In
July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets." SFAS No. 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have
indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their


useful lives. The amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001. With respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired
prior to July 1, 2001, the Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. The Company expects the adoption of SFAS No. 142 will significantly reduce
amortization of goodwill and intangibles
commencing January 1, 2002; however, impairment reviews may result in future periodic write-downs. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of the provisions of SFAS
No. 142 will have on its intangible assets.

Goodwill
reflects the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets of companies acquired in purchase transactions. For the 2001 acquisitions closed prior to July 1, 2001, the
aggregate purchase price exceeded the underlying fair value of the net assets acquired by $53,103 which has been assigned to goodwill and was being amortized over 20 to 30 years. Amortization
of this goodwill will cease on January 1, 2002. For the 2001 acquisitions closed subsequent to June 30, 2001, the aggregate purchase price exceeded the underlying fair value of the net
assets acquired by $18,613 which has been assigned to goodwill and has not been amortized. The Company recorded goodwill amortization expense of $53,406 and $59,217 ($44,781 and $50,903, net of tax)
for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The Company assesses the recoverability of goodwill, as well as other long-lived assets, when there is an indication of
possible impairment, based upon expectations of future undiscounted cash flows in accordance with SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." Accumulated amortization of goodwill was $128,662 and $183,022 as of December 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively.

h.    Long-Lived
Assets

In
accordance with SFAS No. 121, the Company reviews long-lived assets and all intangible assets (including goodwill) for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation
to which the assets relate, to the carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be
unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long-lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is
determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets.

i.      Customer
Acquisition Costs

Costs
related to the acquisition of large volume accounts, net of revenues received for the initial transfer of the records, are capitalized and amortized for an appropriate period not
to exceed 12 years. If the customer terminates its relationship with the Company, the unamortized cost is charged to expense. However, in the event of such termination, the Company collects,
and records as income, permanent removal fees that generally equal or exceed the amount of the unamortized costs. As of December 31, 2000 and 2001, accumulated amortization of those costs was
$5,975 and $8,838, respectively. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 142 will have on its customer acquisition costs.


j.      Deferred
Financing Costs

Deferred
financing costs are amortized over the life of the related debt using the effective interest rate method. If debt is retired early, the related unamortized deferred financing
costs are written off as an extraordinary charge in the period the debt is retired. As of December 31, 2000 and 2001, accumulated amortization of those costs was $5,592 and $4,766,
respectively.

k.    Investment
in Preferred Stock

In
May 2000, the Company made a $6,500 investment in the convertible preferred stock of LiveVault Corporation, a technology development company. In September 2001, the
Company recorded an impairment charge in other income (expense) of $6,925, including the original investment and certain loans related to such investment. In December 2001, in connection with a
recapitalization of this technology development company, the Company made an additional $2,000 investment in the convertible preferred stock of such company. As of December 31, 2000 and 2001,
such investment has been included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

m.    Revenues

The
Company's revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service and storage material sales revenues. Storage revenues consist of periodic charges related to the storage of
materials (either on a per unit or per cubic foot of records basis). In certain circumstances, based upon customer requirements, storage revenues include periodic charges associated with normal,
recurring service activities. Service and storage material sales revenues are comprised of charges for related service activities, the sale of storage materials and courier operations. In certain
circumstances, storage material sales are recorded net of product costs when the Company functions as a sales representative of the product manufacturer and does not receive or take title to the
products. Customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms.

Storage
and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective service is provided. Storage material sales are recognized when shipped to the customer. Amounts related to future
storage


for customers where storage fees are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred income and amortized over the applicable period.

n.    Deferred
Rent

The
Company has entered into various leases for buildings used in the storage of records. Certain leases have fixed escalation clauses or other features which require normalization of
the rental expense over the life of the lease resulting in deferred rent being reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company has assumed various above market
leases in connection with certain of its acquisitions. The difference between discounted present value of these lease obligations and the market rate at the date of the acquisition was recorded as a
net deferred rent liability and is being amortized over the remaining lives of the respective leases.

o.    Stock-based
Compensation

Effective
January 1, 1996, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." The Company has elected to continue to account for
stock options at their intrinsic value with disclosure of the effects of fair value accounting on net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share on a pro forma basis.

During
the second and third quarters of 2000, the Company entered into separation agreements with certain executives. The separation agreements for these executives included the
acceleration of vesting and extension of the exercise period of previously granted stock options, which resulted in a non-cash charge of $15,110. There were no such costs in 2001. In
accordance with Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," compensation is equal to the intrinsic value at the date of measurement, and
recorded in the statement of operations as stock option compensation expense.

p.    Merger-related
Expenses

Merger-related
expenses as presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relate primarily to non-capitalizable expenses directly related to the merger of
the Company and Pierce Leahy Corp. and consist primarily of severance and pay-to-stay payments, cost of exiting certain facilities, system conversion costs and other
transaction-related costs.

q.    Reclassifications

Certain
reclassifications have been made to the 1999 and 2000 financial consolidated statements to conform to the 2001 presentation.


2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

r.    New
Accounting Pronouncements

In
July, 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142. See Note 2.g. "Goodwill" for discussions regarding the effect of the adoption of the provisions. In
October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", which supersedes SFAS No. 121, and provisions of APB
Opinion No. 30 "Reporting the Results of Operations—Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions", for the disposal of segments of a business. The statement creates one accounting model, based on the framework established in SFAS No. 121, to be applied to all
long-lived assets including discontinued operations. SFAS No. 144 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2002. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of
implementing SFAS No. 144.

3. Common Stock Split

On December 5, 2001, the Company's Board of Directors authorized and approved a three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a
dividend on the Company's common stock. Such additional shares of common stock were issued on December 31, 2001 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 17,
2001. All share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the stock split.

a.    Revolving
Credit Facility and Term Loans

On
August 14, 2000, the Company entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement. The credit agreement, as amended, replaced the Company's prior credit facility,
increased the aggregate principal amount available to $750 million and included two tranches of term debt. Tranches A and B represent term loans to the Company in principal amounts of $150,000
and $200,000, respectively. The Tranche A term loan and the revolving credit component of the credit agreement mature on January 31, 2005, while the Tranche B term loan matures on
February 28, 2006. The interest rate on borrowings under the credit agreement varies depending on the Company's choice of base rates, plus an applicable margin. Restrictive covenants under this
agreement are similar to those under the Company's prior credit facility. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $348,750 under the credit agreement, and the
interest rates in effect ranged from 4.15% to 4.84%.

In
December 2000, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract to hedge the risk of changes in market interest rates on the Company's Tranche B term loan. The
instrument is a variable-for-fixed swap of quarterly interest payments payable on certain amounts of the Tranche B term loan through 2006. The notional value of the swap equals
$99,500 and has a fixed rate of 5.9% and a variable rate based on periodic three-month LIBOR rates. In January 2001, the Company entered into a second interest rate swap contract on the Tranche
B term loan. The notional value of the second swap equals $96,000 and has a fixed rate of 5.5% and a variable rate based on periodic three-month LIBOR rates.


The
credit agreement specifies certain minimum or maximum relationships between Adjusted EBITDA (as defined therein) and interest, total debt and fixed charges. There are restrictions on
dividends declared by the Company, sales or pledging of assets, investments and changes in business and ownership. Cash dividends are effectively prohibited. The Company was in compliance with all
debt covenants as of December 31, 2001. Loans under the credit agreement are secured by pledges of the capital stock of all of the Company's domestic subsidiaries.

b.    Publicly
Issued Notes

As
of December 31, 2001, the Company has four series of senior subordinated notes issued to the public, that are obligations of the parent company, Iron Mountain Incorporated (the
"Parent notes"):

•

$120,000
principal amount of notes maturing on July 15, 2007 and bearing interest at a rate of 9


/


% per annum, payable
semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15;

•

$250,000
principal amount of notes maturing on September 30, 2009 and bearing interest at a rate of 8


/


% per annum, payable
semi-annually in arrears on March 31 and September 30;

•

$150,000
principal amount of notes maturing on July 1, 2011 and bearing interest at a rate of 8


/


% per annum, payable
semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1; and

•

$435,000
principal amount of notes maturing on April 1, 2013 and bearing interest at a rate of 8


/


% per annum, payable
semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1.

The
Parent notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by substantially all of the Company's direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries
(the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. In addition, the 9


/


% notes are secured by a second lien on 65% of the stock of Iron Mountain
Canada Corporation ("Canada Company"). The remainder of the Company's subsidiaries do not guarantee the Parent notes.

In
addition, Canada Company, the Company's principal Canadian subsidiary, has publicly issued $135,000 principal amount of senior notes that mature on May 15, 2008 and bear
interest at a rate of 8


/


% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15. The Subsidiary notes are general unsecured obligations of
Canada Company, ranking

pari passu

in right of payment to all of Canada Company's existing and future senior indebtedness. The Subsidiary notes are
fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by Iron Mountain and the Guarantors. In addition, several of the non-guarantors that are organized under the laws of
Canadian provinces fully and unconditionally guarantee the Subsidiary notes on a senior basis. As with the Parent Notes, these guarantees are joint and several.

During
2001, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $435,000 in aggregate principal amount of 8


/


% notes and redeemed the 11


/


% notes of
$130,000 due 2006 and 10


/


% notes of $165,000 due 2006.

The


/


% notes and the Subsidiary notes were assumed in the Pierce Leahy merger and were recorded at their fair market value on the date of merger. The resulting net
discount is being amortized over the remaining period to maturity using the effective interest rate method.


Each
of the indentures for the notes provides that the Company may redeem the outstanding notes, in whole or in part, upon satisfaction of certain terms and conditions. In any
redemption, the Company is also required to pay all accrued but unpaid interest on the outstanding notes.

The
following table presents the various redemption dates and prices of the public notes. The redemption dates reflect the date at or after which the notes may be redeemed at the
Company's option at a premium redemption price. After these dates, the notes may be redeemed at 100% of face value through maturity:

108.25% of the principal amount.

The
Company may under certain conditions redeem up to 35% of the Subsidiary notes with the net proceeds of one or more public equity offerings, at a redemption price of 108.125% of the

In
addition, until April 1, 2004, the Company may under certain conditions redeem up to 35% of the 8


/


% notes with the net proceeds of one or more public equity
offerings, at a redemption price of 108.625% of the principal amount.

Each
of the indentures for the notes provides that the Company or, in the case of the Subsidiary notes, Canada Company must repurchase, at the option of the holders, the notes at 101% of
their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of a "Change of Control," which is defined in each respective indenture. Except for required repurchases upon the
occurrence of a Change of Control or in the event of certain asset sales, each as described in the respective indenture, the Company is not required to make sinking fund or redemption payments with
respect to any of the notes.

The
indentures for the notes contain restrictive covenants similar to those contained in the Amended Credit Agreement.


h.    Real
Estate Mortgages

In
connection with the purchase of real estate and acquisitions, the Company assumed several mortgages on real property. The mortgages bear interest at rates ranging from 6.6% to 8.5%
and are payable in various installments through 2025.

i.      Seller
Notes

In
connection with the merger with Pierce Leahy in 2000, the Company assumed debt related to certain existing notes as a result of certain acquisitions which Pierce Leahy completed in
1999. The notes bear interest at rate of 4.75% per year. The outstanding balance on the seller notes at December 31, 2001 is due on demand through 2009 and is classified as a current portion of
long-term debt.

j.      Other

Other
long-term debt includes various notes and obligations assumed by the Company as a result of certain acquisitions completed by the Company during the years 1998 through
2001. At December 31, 2001, the Company's 50.1% owned subsidiary, IM Europe, had various agreements with its local banks that provide for $33,921 of credit and carried an average effective
interest rate of 5.89%.

6. Acquisitions

On February 1, 2000, the Company completed its acquisition of Pierce Leahy in a stock-for-stock merger valued at
$1.0 billion. The total consideration for this transaction was comprised of: (i) 18.8 million shares of the Company's common stock with a fair value of $421.2 million;
(ii) 1.6 million options to acquire the Company's common stock with a fair value of $25.3 million; (iii) assumed debt with a fair value of $584.9 million; and
(iv) $4.3 million of capitalized transaction costs.

The
Company purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of 17, 12 and 16 records management businesses during 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Each of
these acquisitions was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the results of operations for each acquisition have been included in the consolidated results of the
Company from their respective acquisition dates. Consideration for the various acquisitions included: (i) cash, which was provided through the Company's credit facilities, the Company's 1999
equity offering and the issuance of the 10

/


%, 8


/


% and 8


/


% notes; (ii) issuances of the Company's common stock and
options to purchase the Company's common stock; and (iii) certain net assets of businesses previously acquired.

A
summary of the consideration paid and the allocation of the purchase price of the acquisitions is as follows:

Allocation
of the purchase price for the 2001 acquisitions was based on estimates of the fair value of net assets acquired, and is subject to adjustment. The purchase price allocations
of certain 2001 transactions are subject to finalization of the assessment of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, operating leases and deferred income taxes. The Company is not aware of
any information that would indicate that the final purchase price allocations will differ significantly from preliminary estimates.

In
connection with the acquisitions completed in 1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company has undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses. The restructuring activities include
certain reductions in staffing levels, elimination of duplicate facilities and other costs associated with exiting


certain activities of the acquired businesses. These restructuring activities were recorded as costs of the acquisitions and were provided in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 95-3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination." The Company finalizes its restructuring plans for each business no later than one year
from the date of acquisition. Unresolved matters at December 31, 2001 primarily include completion of planned abandonments of facilities and severances for certain 2000 and 2001 acquisitions.

The
following is a summary of reserves related to such restructuring activities:

At
December 31, 2000 the restructuring reserves related to acquisitions consisted of lease losses on abandoned facilities ($18,370), severance costs for approximately 17 people
($3,151) and move and other exit costs ($6,993).

At
December 31, 2001 the restructuring reserves related to acquisitions consisted of lease losses on abandoned facilities ($10,129), severance costs for approximately 31 people
($980) and move and other exit costs ($5,116). These accruals are expected to be used within one year of the date of this balance sheet except for lease losses of $5,848 and severance contracts of
$547, both of which are based on contracts that extend beyond one year.

A
total of 9,266,271 shares of common stock have been reserved for grants of options and other rights under the Company's various stock incentive plans and employee stock purchase plan.


During
2000, the Company assumed the two existing stock option plans of Pierce Leahy, resulting in 2.5 million additional stock options outstanding. The options were accounted for
as additional purchase price at their fair value.

The
following is a summary of stock option transactions, including those issued to employees of acquired companies, during the applicable periods, excluding transactions under the
employee stock purchase plan:

Except
for the options granted in connection with acquisitions, the stock options were granted with exercise prices equal to the market price of the stock at the date of grant. The
majority of options become exercisable ratably over a period of five years unless the holder terminates employment. The number of shares available for grant at December 31, 2001 was 1,589,640.

Effective
January 1, 1996, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123. The Company has elected to continue to account for stock options issued to employees at their
intrinsic value with disclosure of fair value accounting on net loss and loss per share on a pro forma basis. Had the Company elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of the
options granted at


grant date as prescribed by SFAS No. 123, net loss and net loss per share would have been increased to the pro forma amounts indicated in the table below:

8. Income (Loss) Per Share—Basic and Diluted

In accordance with SFAS No. 128, basic income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing income (loss) available to shareholders by the weighted average
number of shares outstanding. The calculation of
diluted income (loss) per share is consistent with that of basic income (loss) per share but gives effect to all dilutive potential shares (that is, securities such as options, warrants or convertible
securities) that were outstanding during the period, unless the effect is antidilutive.

Because
their effect is antidilutive, 3,382,208, 5,048,543 and 4,284,392 shares of potential common stock underlying outstanding options have been excluded from the above calculation for
the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.

9. Discontinued Operations

In June 1999, in order to focus on its records and information management services business, the Company decided to sell its information technology
staffing business, Arcus Staffing Resources, Inc. was acquired in January 1998 as part of the acquisition of Arcus Group, Inc.. Effective November 1, 1999, the Company
completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of Arcus Staffing. The terms of the sale included contingent payments for a period of 18 months. In accordance with the provisions of APB
No. 30, the sale of Arcus Staffing was accounted for as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, the Arcus Staffing operations were segregated from the Company's continuing operations and
reported as a separate line item on the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Revenue and net income from discontinued operations for the ten months ended October 31, 1999 were
$35,455 and $241, respectively.

In
1999, the Company recorded an estimated loss on the sale of Arcus Staffing of $13,400, comprised of a write-off of goodwill, a deferred tax benefit and estimated expenses
directly related to


the transaction partially offset by the estimated income from operations of Arcus Staffing through the date of disposition. The Company will continue to assess the adequacy of the remaining
liabilities as certain contingencies are resolved.

10. Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities.

The
components of income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and minority interest are:

The
Company has estimated federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2005 through 2021 of $173,324 at December 31, 2001 to reduce future federal income
taxes, if any. The preceding net operating loss carryforwards do not include potential preacquisition net operating loss carryforwards of Arcus Group and certain other foreign acquisitions. Any tax
benefit related to these loss carryforwards will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill, if and when realized. The Company also has estimated state net operating loss carryforwards of $215,222. The
state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 56%. Additionally, the Company has alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $587, which have no
expiration date and are available to reduce future income taxes, if any.

The
Company receives a tax deduction upon exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the
underlying common stock on the date of exercise, which is included in the net operating loss carryforwards above. During the year, the Company recognized $8,880 of tax benefit related to the exercise
of non-qualified stock options, the value of which was included as part of the purchase price of certain businesses.

This
benefit was used to reduce goodwill of acquired companies in 2001. In addition, $5,985 of tax benefit related to the exercise of options (unrelated to acquisitions) was credited to
equity during the year.

Company and its U.S. subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The provision for income tax consists of the following components:

12. Segment Information

During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company began to operate in nine operating segments, based on their economic environment, geographic area, the nature of
their services and the nature of their processes:

•

Business
Records Management—the storage of paper documents, as well as all other non-electronic media such as microfilm and
microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, X-rays and blueprints, including healthcare information services, vital records services and service and courier operations

•

Off-Site
Data Protection—the storage and rotation of back-up computer media as part of corporate disaster and business
recovery plans, including service and courier operations

•

Confidential
Destruction—the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents for corporate customers

•

Fulfillment—the
storage of customer marketing literature and delivery to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' sites based on
current and prospective customer orders; the assembly of custom marketing packages and orders; the management and detailed reporting on customer marketing literature inventories

•

Digital
Archiving Services—storage and related services for electronic records conveyed via telecommunication lines and the Internet


•

Europe—records
and information management services and off-site data protection services throughout Europe

•

Canada—records
and information management services throughout Canada

•

South
America—records and information management services throughout South America

•

Mexico—records
and information management services throughout Mexico

The
Europe, Canada, South America and Mexico operating segments do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for a reporting segment, but have been aggregated and reported as one
reporting segment, "International," given their similar economic characteristics, products, customers and processes. The Confidential Destruction, Fulfillment and Digital Archiving Services operating
segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds for a reportable segment and thus are included in the "Corporate and Other" category. Adjusted EBITDA has been regularly evaluated by the chief
operating decision maker in deciding resource allocation and performance assessment. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization) adjusted for extraordinary items, other income (expense), merger-related expenses, stock option compensation expense and minority interest. Corporate items include
non-operating overhead, corporate general and administrative expenses, non-allocated operating expenses and intersegment eliminations. Corporate assets are principally cash and
cash equivalents, prepaid items, certain non-operating fixed assets, certain non-allocated goodwill, deferred income taxes, certain non-trade receivables, certain
intersegment receivables, and deferred financing costs. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, with the exception of: (i) certain costs allocated by Corporate to the other segments, primarily domestic and Canadian segments, based on allocation rates set at the beginning of
each year; and (ii) certain non-cash charges (such as deferred lease amortization) maintained at Corporate.

The
Company's consulting business, previously analyzed as part of Business Records Management, is now analyzed within the Corporate & Other category. In addition, certain
allocations from Corporate & Other to Business Records Management and Off-Site Data Protection have been changed. To the extent practicable, the prior period numbers shown above
have been adjusted to reflect both such changes.

13. Commitments and Contingencies

a.    Leases

The
Company leases most of its facilities under various operating leases. A majority of these leases have renewal options of five to ten years and have either fixed or Consumer Price
Index escalation clauses. The Company also leases equipment under operating leases, primarily computers which have an average lease life of three years. Trucks and office equipment are also leased and
have remaining lease lives ranging from one to seven years. Rent expense was $59,113, $111,001 and $126,871 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.

Minimum
future lease payments are as follows:

$

796,561

The
Company uses synthetic leases that involve some of the facilities that the Company occupies. Under these leases, special purpose entities are established to acquire properties and
subsequently lease those properties to the Company. Seven financial institutions have provided over 50% of the capacity under our $400.0 million revolving credit facility (see Note 17).
These seven financial institutions also participate in our synthetic lease programs. Neither the Company nor any of our related parties have invested, either via debt obligations or equity, in these
special purpose entities. The leases are designed and qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes, where the monthly lease expense is recorded as rent expense in the Company's consolidated
statements of operations. The Company does not consolidate the assets or debt related to these facilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

Included
in the lease commitments disclosed in the preceding paragraph are synthetic lease agreements signed in 1998 to 2001. Each of the leases under the Company's synthetic leases have
a five to six and one-half year term for specified records storage warehouses and include 30 of 519 leased facilities the Company occupies. During 2001, the Company recorded $8.5 million in
rent expense on its income statement related to these lease commitments. The Company's synthetic lease facilities included properties with a lessor's original cost of $74.3 million and
$151.9 million as of December 31, 2000 and December 31, 2001, respectively. If on January 1, 2001, the original cost of the Company's properties under synthetic lease
facilities had equaled $151.9 million, rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 would have been approximately $11.4 million. At the end of each lease term, the Company,
at its option, may: (i) negotiate a renewal of the lease (which is subject to the agreement of the relevant synthetic lease lessor and its lenders); (ii) purchase the properties subject
to such lease at a price equal to the lessor's original cost; or (iii) allow the lease to expire and cause the properties to be sold. The Company's ability to cause the properties to be sold
depends upon its compliance with


certain terms of the lease. Under certain conditions, the Company would receive the excess, if any, of the net sales proceeds over the properties' original cost. In the event that the net sales
proceeds are less than the properties' original cost, the Company would make certain contingent rental payments to the lessor equal to that difference, subject to a maximum amount of approximately 85%
of the properties' original cost. If any of the Company's synthetic lease facilities are terminated following an event of default under the relevant synthetic lease documents, or if, at the end of the
lease term, the Company does not either negotiate a renewal of the lease or elect to cause the relevant leased properties to be sold, or if the Company does elect to cause such leased properties to be
sold but fail to satisfy the conditions to such election, the Company would generally be obligated to pay the lessor's original cost for such leased properties.

b.    Facility
Fire

In
March 1997, the Company experienced three fires, all of which authorities have determined were caused by arson. These fires resulted in damage to one and destruction of the
Company's other records management facility in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey.

Some
of the Company's customers or their insurance carriers have asserted claims as a consequence of the destruction of or damage to their records as a result of the fires, some of which
allege negligence or other culpability on the part of the Company. The Company has received notices of claims and lawsuits filed by customers and abutters seeking damages against the Company and to
rescind their written contracts with the Company. The Company denies any liability as a result of the destruction of or damage to customer records as a result of the fires, which were beyond its
control, and intends to vigorously defend itself against these and any other lawsuits that may arise. The Company is also pursuing coverage of these claims and lawsuits with its various insurers. The
claims process is lengthy and its outcome cannot be predicted with certainty.

Based
on its present assessment of the situation, management, after consultation with legal counsel, does not believe that the fires will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial condition or results of operations, although there can be no assurance in this regard.

c.    Other
Litigation

The
Company is presently involved as a defendant in various litigation which has occurred in the normal course of business. Management believes it has meritorious defenses in all such
actions, and in any event, the amount of damages, if such matters were decided adversely, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

14. Related Party Transactions

The Company leases space to an affiliated company, Schooner Capital LLC ("Schooner"), for its corporate headquarters located in Boston, Massachusetts. For the
years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, Schooner paid the Company rent totaling $94, $96 and $101, respectively. The Company leases facilities from three separate limited partnerships,
whose general partner is a related party. The aggregate rental payment by the Company for such facilities during 2000 and 2001 was


$1,684 and $513, respectively. In the opinion of management, all of these leases were entered into at market prices and terms.

The
Company has an agreement with Leo W. Pierce, Sr., former Chairman Emeritus of the Company and the father of J. Peter Pierce, a Director of the Company that requires pension payments
of $8 per month until his death. The total benefit is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

At
December 31, 2001, the Company has outstanding loans to an officer with an aggregate principal amount of $331. These notes bear interest at a variable rate. This liability was
assumed in connection with the Company's merger with Pierce Leahy.

Effective
December 1, 2000, the Company sold its wholly owned UK subsidiary Datavault Limited (acquired in the Pierce Leahy merger) to its 50.1% owned subsidiary, Iron Mountain
Europe, in exchange for approximately $18 million of Iron Mountain Europe stock and debt of approximately $14 million. In connection with this transaction, the Company's 49.9% partner in
Iron Mountain Europe contributed approximately $18 million dollars to Iron Mountain Europe in exchange for additional shares. The transaction was accounted for as a transfer between entities
under common control and no gain or loss was recorded on the sale.

15. Employee Benefit Plans

a.    Iron
Mountain Companies 401(k) Plan

The
Company has a defined contribution plan, which generally covers all non-union U.S. employees meeting certain service requirements. Eligible employees may elect to defer
from 1% to 20% of compensation per pay period up to the amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company makes matching contributions based on the amount of an employee's contribution
according to a schedule as described in the plan document. The Company has expensed $1,890, $2,646 and $2,280 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.

b.    Employee
Stock Purchase Plan

On
March 23, 1998, the Company introduced an employee stock purchase plan (the "Plan"), participation in which is available to substantially all employees who meet certain service
eligibility requirements. The Plan was approved by the shareholders of the Company on May 28, 1998 and commenced operations on October 1, 1998. The Plan provides a way for eligible
employees of the Company to become shareholders of the Company on favorable terms. The Plan provides for the purchase of up to 562,500 shares of the Company's common stock by eligible employees
through successive offering periods. At the start of each offering period, participating employees are granted options to acquire the Company's common stock. During each offering period, participating
employees accumulate after-tax payroll contributions, up to a maximum of 15% of their compensation, to pay the exercise price of their options. At the end of the offering period,
outstanding options are exercised, and each employee's accumulated contributions are used to purchase common stock of the Company. The price for shares purchased under the Plan is 85% of their market
price at either the beginning or the


end of the offering period, whichever is lower. There were 76,360, 139,869 and 186,152 shares purchased under the Plan for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.

17. Subsequent Event

On March 15, 2002, the Company entered into a new amended and restated revolving credit agreement (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement"). The
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement replaces the Company's existing credit agreement. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement has an aggregate principal amount of $650,000 and includes a $400,000
revolving credit facility and a term loan facility in the amount of $250,000. The revolving credit facility matures on January 31, 2005 while the term loan is to be paid in full on
February 15, 2008; however, if the 9


/


% senior subordinated notes are not redeemed or repurchased prior to April 15, 2007 the term loan will mature on April 15,
2007. The interest rate on borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement varies depending on the Company's choice of base rates and currency options, plus an applicable margin.
Restrictive covenants under this agreement are similar to those under the Company's prior credit facility. All intercompany notes are now pledged to secure the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.


REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors of

Iron Mountain Europe Limited:

We
have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Iron Mountain Europe Limited as of October 31, 2000 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and comprehensive loss and cash flows (not presented separately herein) for the two years ended October 31, 2001 and the ten months ended October 31, 1999. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the management of Iron Mountain Europe Limited. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Iron Mountain Europe Limited at
October 31, 2000 and 2001 and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows (not presented separately herein) for the two years ended October 31, 2001
and the ten months ended October 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors of

Iron Mountain Incorporated:

We
have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, the consolidated financial statements of Iron Mountain Incorporated (a Pennsylvania
corporation) for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 and have issued our report thereon dated February 22, 2002 (except with respect to Note 17, as to
which the date is March 15, 2002). Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those basic financial statements taken as a whole. The supplemental schedule listed in the
accompanying index is the responsibility of Iron Mountain Incorporated's management and is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and regulations under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. The supplemental schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audits of the
basic financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
