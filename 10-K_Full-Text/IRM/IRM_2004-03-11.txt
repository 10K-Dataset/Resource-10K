A. Development of Business.

We are the leader in records and information management services. We are an international, full-service provider of records and information management
and related services, enabling customers to outsource these functions. We have a diversified customer base comprised of numerous commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance,
entertainment, and government organizations, including more than half of the Fortune 500 and more than two thirds of the FTSE 100. Our comprehensive solutions help customers save money and
manage risks associated with legal and regulatory compliance, protection of vital assets, and business continuity challenges.

Our
core business records management services include: records management program development and implementation based on best-practices to help customers comply with
specific regulatory requirements; implementation of policy-based programs that feature secure, cost-effective storage for all major media, including paper, which is the dominant form of
records storage, flexible retrieval access and retention management; digital archiving services for secure, legally compliant and cost-effective long-term archiving of
electronic records; secure shredding services that ensure privacy and a secure chain of record custody; and specialized services for vital records, film and sound and regulated industries such as
healthcare, energy and financial services.

Our
off-site data protection services include: disaster preparedness planning support; secure, off-site vaulting of data backup media for fast and efficient data
recovery in the
event of a disaster, human error or virus; electronic vaulting to provide managed, online data backup and recovery services for personal computers and server data; and intellectual property escrow
services to protect and manage source code and other proprietary information with a trusted, neutral third party.

In
addition to our core records management and off-site data protection services, we sell storage materials, including cardboard boxes and magnetic media, and provide
consulting, facilities management, fulfillment and other outsourcing services.

Iron
Mountain was founded in 1951 in an underground facility near Hudson, New York. Now in our 53

rd

year, we have experienced tremendous growth and organizational change,
particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in February 1996. Since then, we have built ourselves from a regional business with limited product
offerings and annual revenues of $104 million in 1995 into the leader in records and information management services, providing a full range of services to customers in markets around the
world. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we had total revenues of $1.5 billion.

The
growth since 1995 has been accomplished primarily through the acquisition of U.S. and international records management companies. The goal of our current acquisition program is to
supplement internal growth by continuing to establish a footprint in targeted international markets and adding fold-in acquisitions both in the U.S. and internationally. Having
substantially completed our North American geographic expansion by the end of 2000, we shifted our focus from growth through acquisitions to internal revenue growth. In 2001, as a result of this
shift, internal revenue growth exceeded growth through acquisitions for the first time since we began our acquisition program in 1996. This was also the case in 2002 and 2003, and in the absence of
unusual acquisition activity, we expect this trend to continue. We expect to achieve our internal revenue growth through a sophisticated new sales and account management coverage model that is
designed to drive incremental revenue by acquiring new customer relationships, increasing the revenue generated by existing customer relationships and by effectively selling a wide range of
complementary and ancillary services to expand our new and existing customer relationships.


In
July 2003, we and Iron Mountain Europe ("IME"), our European joint venture, completed the acquisition of the records management operations of Hays plc ("Hays IMS") in two
simultaneous transactions for aggregate cash consideration (including transactions costs) of approximately 205 million British pounds sterling ($333 million). IME acquired the European
operations and we acquired the U.S. operations. IME's acquisition of Hays IMS has more than doubled our revenue base in Europe and has significantly strengthened our energy and U.K. public sector
business lines. Since the acquisition, we have been integrating the cultures, operating systems and procedures, and information technology systems of IME and Hays IMS.

In
February 2004, we completed the acquisition of Mentmore plc's 49.9% equity interest in IME for total consideration of 82.5 million British pounds sterling
($154 million) in cash. Included in this amount is the repayment of all trade and working capital funding owed to Mentmore by IME. Completion of the transaction gives us 100% ownership of IME,
affording us full access to all future cash flows and greater strategic and financial flexibility.

As
of December 31, 2003, we provided services to over 200,000 customer accounts in 82 markets in the U.S. and 58 markets outside of the U.S., employed over 13,000 people
and operated approximately 800 records management facilities in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Latin America.

B. Description of Business.

The Records and Information Management Services Industry

Overview

Companies in the records and information management services industry store and manage information in a variety of media formats, which can broadly be divided
into physical and electronic records, and provide a wide range of services related to the records stored. We refer to our general physical records storage and management services as business records
management. We define physical records to include paper documents, as well as all other non-electronic media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film,
X-rays and blueprints. Electronic records include various forms of magnetic media such as computer tapes and hard drives and optical disks. We include in our electronic records storage and
management services (1) off-site data protection and (2) digital archiving services.

Physical Records

Physical records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. Active records relate to ongoing and recently completed activities or contain
information that is frequently referenced. Active records are usually stored and managed on-site by the organization that originated them to ensure ready availability. Inactive physical
records are the principal focus of the records and information management services industry. Inactive records consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be
retained for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. A large and growing specialty subset of the physical records market is
medical records. These are active and semi-active records that are often stored off-site with and serviced by a records and information management services vendor. Special
regulatory requirements often apply to medical records.

Electronic Records

Electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of recently processed data or
archival in nature. Customer needs for data backup and recovery and archiving are distinctively different. Backup data exists because of the need of many businesses to maintain backup copies of their
data in order to be able to recover the data in the event of a system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. It is customary (and a


best-practice)
for data processing groups to rotate backup tapes to off-site locations on a regular basis and to require multiple copies of such information at multiple sites.
We refer to these services as off-site data protection.

In
addition to the physical rotation and storage of backup data, we offer electronic vaulting services as an alternative way for businesses to transfer data to us, and to access the data
they have stored with us. Electronic vaulting is a Web-based service that automatically backs up computer data over the Internet and stores it off site in one of our secure data centers.
In early 2003, we announced an expansion of the electronic vaulting service to include backup and recovery for personal computer data, answering customers' needs to protect critical business data,
which is often orphaned and unprotected on employee laptops and desktop personal computers.

There
is a growing need for better ways of archiving data for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons and for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations.
Historically, businesses have relied on backup tapes for storing archived data, but this process can be costly and ineffective when attempting to search and retrieve the data for litigation or other
needs. In addition, many industries, such as healthcare and financial services, are facing increased governmental regulation mandating the
way in which electronic records are stored and managed. To help customers meet these growing storage challenges, we introduced digital archiving services. We have experienced early market adoption of
these services, especially for e-mail archiving, which enables businesses to identify and retrieve electronic records quickly and cost-effectively, while maintaining regulatory
compliance.

Growth of Market

We believe that the volume of stored physical and electronic records will continue to increase for a number of reasons, including: (1) the rapid growth of
inexpensive document producing technologies such as facsimile, desktop publishing software and desktop printing; (2) the continued proliferation of data processing technologies such as personal
computers and networks; (3) regulatory requirements; (4) concerns over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of documentation;
(5) the high cost of reviewing records and deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and
(7) audit requirements to keep backup copies of certain records in off-site locations.

We
believe that paper-based information will continue to grow, not in spite of, but because of, new "paperless" technologies such as e-mail and the Internet. These
technologies have prompted the creation of hard copies of such electronic information and have also led to increased demand for electronic records services, such as the storage and
off-site rotation of backup copies of magnetic media. In addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital information technologies and distributed data networks has created an
emerging need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality solutions for digital archiving and the management of electronic documents.

Consolidation of a Highly Fragmented Industry

There was significant consolidation within the highly fragmented records and information management services industry from 1995 to 2000. Most records and
information management services companies serve a single local market, and are often either owner-operated or ancillary to another business, such as a moving and storage company. We believe that the
consolidation trend will continue because of the industry's capital requirements for growth, opportunities for large records and information management services providers to achieve economies of scale
and customer demands for more sophisticated technology-based solutions.

We
believe that the consolidation trend in the industry is also due to, and will continue as a result of, the preference of certain large organizations to contract with one vendor in
multiple cities and countries for multiple services. In particular, customers increasingly demand a single, large, sophisticated company to handle all of their important physical and electronic
records needs. Large,


national
and multinational companies are better able to satisfy these demands than smaller competitors. We have made, and intend to continue to make, acquisitions of our competitors, many of whom are
small, single city operators.

Description of Our Business

We generate our revenues by providing storage for a variety of information media formats, core records management services and an expanding menu of complementary
products and services to a large and diverse customer base. Providing outsourced storage for records and information is the mainstay of our customer relationships and provides the foundation for our
revenue growth. The core services, which are a vital part of a comprehensive records management program, are highly recurring in nature and therefore very predictable. Core services consist primarily
of the handling and transportation of stored records and information. In our secure shredding business, core services consist primarily of the scheduled collection and handling of sensitive records.
In 2003, our storage and core service revenues represented approximately 87% of our total revenues. In addition to our core services, we offer a wide array of complementary products and services such
as performing special project work, selling records and information management services related products, providing fulfillment services and consulting on records management issues. These services
address more specific needs and are designed to enhance our customers' overall records management programs. These services complement our core services; however, they are more episodic and
discretionary in nature. Revenue generated by our business records and off-site data protection businesses includes both core and complementary components.

Our
various operating segments offer the products and services discussed below. In general, our business records management segment offers records management, secure shredding,
healthcare information services, vital records services, and service and courier operations in the U.S. and Canada. Our off-site data protection segment offers data backup and disaster
recovery services, vital records services, service and courier operations, and intellectual property protection services in the U.S. Our international segment offers elements of all our product and
services lines outside the U.S. and Canada. Our corporate and other segment includes our fulfillment, consulting and digital archiving services. Some of our complementary services and products are
offered within all of our segments. The amount of revenues derived from our business records management, off-site data protection, international, and corporate and other operating segments
and other relevant data for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003 are set forth in Note 12 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business Records Management

The hard copy business records stored by our customers with us by their nature are not very active. These types of records are stored in cartons packed by the
customer. We use a proprietary order processing and inventory management system known as the

SafekeeperPLUS

® system to efficiently store and
later retrieve a customer's cartons. Storage charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis, usually either per carton or per cubic foot of records, and include the provision of
space, racking, computerized inventory and activity tracking and physical security.

Off-Site Data Protection

Off-site data protection services consist of the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery and business
continuity plans. Computer tapes, cartridges and disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where they are
available to customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to facilitate data recovery in the event of a disaster. We use various proprietary information technology systems such as

MediaLink

™ and

SecureBase

™ software to manage this process. We also manage tape
library relocations and support disaster recovery testing and execution. In addition, we have introduced electronic vaulting services as part of our off-site data protection services
product line. Our electronic


vaulting
service automatically backs up personal computer and server data over the Internet and stores it off site in one of our secure data centers, always available in the event of a disaster.

Healthcare Information Services

Healthcare information services principally include the handling, storage, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records used by hospitals, private
practitioners and other medical institutions. Medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide easier access to individual
files. Healthcare information services also include recurring project work and ancillary services. Recurring project work involves the on-site removal of aged patient files and related
computerized file indexing. Ancillary healthcare information services include release of information (medical record copying), temporary staffing, contract coding, facilities management and imaging.

Vital Records Services

Vital records contain critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film, software source code and other highly proprietary
information. Vital records may require special facilities or services, either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. Our charges for providing enhanced security and
special climate-controlled environments for vital records are higher than for typical storage functions. We provide the same ancillary services for vital records as we provide for our other storage
operations.

Service and Courier Operations

Service and courier operations are an integral part of a comprehensive records management program for all physical media including paper and electronic records.
They include adding records to storage, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, permanent withdrawals from storage, and destruction of records. Service charges are
generally assessed for each procedure on a per unit basis. The

SafekeeperPLUS

® system controls the service processes from order entry
through transportation and invoicing for business records management while

MediaLink

™ and

SecureBase

™ systems manage the process for the off-site
data protection services business.

Courier
operations consist primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request. Charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location and
are billed monthly. As of December 31, 2003, we were utilizing a fleet of more than 2,000 owned or leased vehicles.

Secure Shredding

Secure shredding is a natural extension of our records management services, completing the lifecycle of a record. The service involves the shredding of sensitive
documents for corporate customers that, in many cases, also use our services for management of less sensitive archival records. We believe that customers are motivated by increased privacy regulation
and the desire to protect their proprietary trade secrets. These services typically include the scheduled pick-up of loose office records which customers accumulate in specially designed
secure containers we provide. Complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste paper to third-party recyclers. Through a combination of plant based shredding operations and
mobile shredding units comprised of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our customers in all of our existing business records management markets throughout the U.S.
and Canada. We seek to expand our presence in this business through acquisitions and internal start-ups that leverage our existing records management infrastructure.


Intellectual Property Protection Services

We provide intellectual property protection services through our wholly-owned subsidiary, DSI Technology Escrow Services, Inc. DSI specializes in third
party technology escrow services that protect intellectual property assets such as software source code. In addition, DSI assists in securing intellectual property as collateral for lending,
investments and other joint ventures, in managing domain name registrations and transfers, and provides expertise and assistance to brokers and dealers in complying with electronic records regulations
of the SEC.

Digital Archiving Services

Our digital archiving services focus on archiving digital information with long-term preservation requirements. These services represent the digital
analogy to our physical records management services. Because of increased litigation risks and regulatory mandates, companies are increasingly aware of the need to apply the same records management
policies and retention schedules to electronic data as they do physical records. Typical digital records include e-mail, e-statements, images, electronic documents retained for
legal or compliance purposes and other data documenting business transactions.

The
growth rate of mission-critical digital information is accelerating, driven in part by the use of the Internet as a distribution and transaction medium. The rising cost and
increasing importance of digital information management, coupled with the increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may create meaningful opportunities for us. We
continue to cultivate marketing and technology partnerships to support this anticipated growth.

We
believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they face in their business records management programs and consist
primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access to and control over the data in a secure environment; and (3) the need to retain electronic records due
to regulatory compliance or for litigation support. Our digital archiving service is representative of our commitment to address evolving records management needs and expand the array of services we
offer.

Complementary Services and Products

We offer a variety of additional services which customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. These services include conducting records
inventories, packing records into cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. We also provide services for the management of active records
programs. We can provide these services, which generally include document and file processing and storage, both off-site at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel to perform
management functions on-site at the customer's premises.

Other
complementary lines of business that we operate include fulfillment services and professional consulting services. Fulfillment services are performed by our wholly-owned
subsidiary, COMAC, Inc. COMAC stores customer marketing literature and delivers this material to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' sites based on current and prospective
customer orders. In addition, COMAC assembles custom marketing packages and orders, and manages and provides detailed reporting on customer marketing literature inventories.

We
provide professional consulting services to customers, enabling them to develop and implement comprehensive records and information management programs. Our consulting business draws
on our experience in records and information management services to analyze the practices of companies and assist them in creating more effective programs of records and information management. Our
consultants work with these customers to develop policies for document review, analysis and evaluation and for scheduling of document retention and destruction.

We
also sell: (1) a full line of specially designed corrugated cardboard, metal and plastic storage containers; (2) magnetic media products including computer tapes, cartridges
and drives, tape cleaners


and
supplies and CDs; and (3) computer room equipment and supplies such as racking systems, furniture, bar code scanners and printers.

Financial Characteristics of Our Business

Our financial model is based on the recurring nature of our revenues. The historical predictability of this revenue stream and the resulting operating income
before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA)


allow us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. Our primary financial goal has always been, and continues to be, to increase
consolidated OIBDA in relation to capital invested, even as our
focus has shifted from growth through acquisitions to internal revenue growth. Our business has the following financial characteristics:


For
a more detailed definition and reconciliation of OIBDA and a discussion of why we believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential
investors, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Measures."

•

Recurring Revenues.

We derive a majority of our consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, fees
charged to customers based on the volume of records stored. Our quarterly revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 60 consecutive quarters. Once a customer places physical
records in storage with us and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed, for which we typically receive a service fee, we receive recurring payments for storage fees without incurring
additional labor or marketing expenses or significant capital costs. Similarly, contracts for the storage of electronic backup media consist primarily of fixed monthly payments. In each of the last
five years, storage revenues, which are stable and recurring, have accounted for approximately 58% of our total revenues. This stable and growing storage revenue base also provides the foundation for
increases in service revenues and OIBDA.

•

Historically Non-Cyclical Storage Business.

We have not experienced any significant reductions in
our storage business as a result of past general economic downturns, although we can give no assurance that this would be the case in the future. We believe that companies that have outsourced records
and information management services are less likely during economic downturns to incur the move-out costs and other expenses associated with switching vendors or moving their records and
information management services programs in-house. However, during this most recent economic slowdown, the rate at which some customers added new cartons to their inventory was below
historical levels. The net effect of these factors is the continued growth of our storage revenue base, albeit at a lower rate.


We
define "Carton" as a measurement of volume equal to a single standard storage carton, approximately 1.2 cubic feet.


We
define "Net Carton Growth From Existing Customers" as the net increase in Cartons attributable to existing customers. This calculation excludes our Latin American and European
operations as well as a portion of our medical records operations.

•

Inherent Growth from Existing Physical Records Customers.

Our physical records
customers have on average generated additional Cartons


at a faster rate than stored Cartons have been destroyed or permanently removed. From January 1, 1998 through
December 31, 2001, our annual Net Carton Growth From Existing Customers


ranged from approximately 4% to approximately 6%. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003,
Net Carton Growth from Existing Customers was between 3% to 4%. We believe the consistent growth of our physical records storage revenues is the result of a number of factors, including:
(1) the trend toward increased records retention; (2) customer satisfaction with our services; and (3) the costs and


inconvenience
of moving storage operations in-house or to another provider of records and information management services.

•

Diversified and Stable Customer Base.

As of December 31, 2003, we had over 200,000 customer accounts in a
variety of industries. We currently provide services to numerous commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than half of
the Fortune 500 and more than two thirds of the FTSE 100. No customer accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003. From January 1,
1999 through December 31, 2003, average annual permanent removals of Cartons, not including destructions, represented approximately 3% of total Cartons stored.

•

Capital Expenditures Related Primarily to Growth.

Our records and information management services business
requires limited annual capital expenditures made in order to maintain our current revenue stream. From January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2003, over 85% of our aggregate capital
expenditures were growth-related investments, primarily in storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. These
growth-related capital expenditures are primarily discretionary and create additional capacity for increases in revenues and OIBDA. In addition, since shifting our focus from growth through
acquisitions to internal revenue growth, our capital expenditures, made primarily to support our internal revenue growth, have exceeded the aggregate acquisition consideration we conveyed in both 2001
and 2002. Although this was not the case in 2003 due to the acquisition of Hays IMS, we expect this to be the case in 2004 and thereafter absent unusual acquisition activity.

Growth Strategy

Our objective is to maintain our position as the leader in records and information management services. In the U.S. and Canada, we seek to be one of the largest
records and information management services providers in each of our geographic markets. Internationally, our objectives are to continue to capitalize on our expertise in the records and information
management services industry and to make additional acquisitions and investments in selected international markets. Our primary
avenues of growth are: (1) increased business with existing customers; (2) the addition of new customers; (3) the introduction of new products and services such as secure
shredding, electronic vaulting and digital archiving; and (4) selective acquisitions in new and existing markets.

Growth from Existing Customers

Our existing customers storing physical records contribute to storage and storage-related service revenues growth because on average they generate additional
Cartons at a faster rate than old Cartons are destroyed or permanently removed. In order to maximize growth opportunities from existing customers, we seek to maintain high levels of customer retention
by providing premium customer service through our local account management staff.

Our
new sales coverage model is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by reallocating our sales resources based on a more sophisticated segmentation of
our customer base and selling additional business records management and off-site data protection services within our existing customer relationships. We also seek to leverage existing
business relationships with our customers by selling complementary services and products. Services include records tracking, indexing, customized reporting, vital records management and consulting
services.

Addition of New Customers

Our sales forces are dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer account relationships, (2) generating additional revenue
from existing customers and (3) expanding new and


existing
customer relationships by effectively selling a wide array of complementary services and products. In order to accomplish these objectives, our sales forces draw on our U.S. and international
marketing organizations and senior management. As a result of acquisitions and our decision to recruit additional qualified sales professionals, we have increased the size of our sales force to
approximately 600 such professionals as of December 31, 2003 from approximately 450 as of December 31, 2002.

Introduction of New Products and Services

We continue to expand our menu of products and services. We have established a national presence in the U.S. and Canadian secure shredding industry and offer new
electronic vaulting and digital archiving services. These new products and services allow us to further penetrate our existing customer accounts and attract new customers in previously untapped
markets.

Growth through Acquisitions

Our acquisition strategy includes expanding geographically, as necessary, and increasing our presence and scale within existing markets through
"fold-in" acquisitions. We have a successful record of acquiring and integrating records and information management services companies. Between January 1, 1996 and
December 31, 2000, the height of our acquisition activity, we completed 78 acquisitions in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Latin America for total consideration of approximately
$2 billion. During that period, we substantially completed our geographic expansion in the U.S. and Canada and began to expand in Europe and Latin America. Between January 1, 2001 and
December 31, 2003, we completed an additional 34 acquisitions for total consideration of approximately $500 million (including the Hays IMS acquisition in July 2003
for approximately $333 million), primarily in the secure shredding industry in the U.S. and the records and information management industry in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Latin America.

Acquisitions in the U.S. and Canada

We intend to continue our acquisition program in the U.S. and Canada focusing on the secure shredding industry, expanding geographically, as necessary and
building scale in some of our smaller markets through "fold-in" acquisitions. However, given the small number of large acquisition prospects and our increased revenue base, future
acquisitions are expected to be less significant to overall U.S. and Canadian revenue growth than they were prior to 2001.

International Growth Strategy

We also intend to continue to make acquisitions and investments in records and information management services businesses outside the U.S. and Canada. We have
acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire and invest in, records and information management services companies in countries, and, more specifically, markets within such countries, where we believe
there is sufficient demand from existing multinational customers or the potential for significant growth. Since beginning our
international expansion program in January 1999, we have directly and through joint ventures, expanded our operations into 19 countries in Europe and Latin America. These transactions
have taken, and may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of the entire business or controlling or minority investments, with a long-term goal of full ownership. In addition to the
criteria we use to evaluate U.S. and Canadian acquisition candidates, we also evaluate the presence in the potential market of our existing customers as well as the risks uniquely associated with an
international investment, including those risks described below.

The
experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important in our international acquisition strategy. As a result, we have formed joint ventures with, or acquired
significant interests in, target businesses throughout Europe and Latin America. We began our international expansion by acquiring a 50.1% controlling interest in each of our Iron Mountain Europe


Limited,
Iron Mountain South America, Ltd. and Sistemas de Archivo Corporativo (a Mexican limited liability company) subsidiaries. Iron Mountain South America has in some cases bought
controlling, yet not full, ownership in local businesses in order to enhance our local market expertise. We believe this strategy, rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets, better
position us to expand the existing business. The local partner benefits from our expertise in the records and information management services industry, our access to capital and our technology, and we
benefit from our local partner's knowledge of the market, relationships with customers and their presence in the community. Our long-term goal is to acquire full ownership of each such
business, as evidenced by our recent acquisition of Mentmore's 49.9% equity interest in IME discussed previously under "—A. Development of Business."

Our
international investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as
fluctuations in currency valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors.

The
amount of our revenues derived from international operations and other relevant financial data for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003 are set forth in Note 12 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we derived approximately 19% of our total revenues from outside of the U.S. We expect this percentage to increase in
2004 due to the acquisition of the European operations of Hays IMS.

Customers

Our customer base is diversified in terms of revenues and industry concentration. We track customer accounts based on invoices. Accordingly, depending upon how
many invoices have been arranged at the
request of a customer, one organization may represent multiple customer accounts. As of December 31, 2003, we had over 200,000 customer accounts in a variety of industries. We currently provide
services to numerous commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than half of the Fortune 500 and more than two thirds of
the FTSE 100. No customer accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Competition

We compete with our current and potential customers' internal records and information management services capabilities. We can provide no assurance that these
organizations will begin or continue to use an outside company such as Iron Mountain for their future records and information management services.

We
compete with multiple records and information management services providers in all geographic areas where we operate. We believe that competition for customers is based on price,
reputation for reliability, quality of service and scope and scale of technology and that we generally compete effectively based on these factors.

We
also compete with other records and information management services providers for companies to acquire. Some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources.
If any such competitor were to devote additional resources to the records and information management services business and such acquisition candidates or focus their strategy on our markets, our
results of operations could be adversely affected.

Alternative Technologies

We derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage-related services. This storage requires significant physical space. Alternative
storage technologies exist, many of which


require
significantly less space than paper documents. These technologies include computer media, microform, CD-ROM and optical disk. To date, none of these technologies has replaced paper
documents as the principal means for storing information. However, we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records in paper documents format. A significant
shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper documents based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our business. We continue
to invest in additional services such as electronic vaulting and digital archiving, designed to address our customers' need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality solutions for
electronic records and information management.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003, we employed over 9,000 employees in the U.S. Directly and through majority-owned joint ventures, as of December 31, 2003,
we employed over 4,000 employees outside of the U.S. A small percentage of our employees are represented by unions. These unionized employees are located in California and two cities in Canada. As of
December 31, 2003, the aggregate number of unionized employees was less than 450.

All
non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability,
retirement/401(k) and accidental death and dismemberment plans. Unionized employees receive these types of benefits through their unions. In addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, all
full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits, collections or attainment of specified objectives
for the unit in which they work. Management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and unions.

Insurance

For strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate market
security in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. Property insurance is purchased on an all-risk basis, including flood and earthquake, subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits
and deductibles, and inclusive of the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. Separate excess policies for insurer
defined Critical Earthquake Zone exposures are maintained at what we believe to be appropriate limits and deductibles for that exposure. Included among other types of insurance that we carry are:
workers compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional and directors and officers liability policies, subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. In 2002, we
established a wholly-owned Vermont domiciled captive insurance company as a subsidiary; through the subsidiary we retain and reinsure a portion of our property loss exposure.

Our
standard form of storage contract sets forth an agreed maximum valuation for each carton or other storage unit held by us, which serves as a limitation of liability for loss or
damage, as permitted under the Uniform Commercial Code. In contracts containing such limits, such values are nominal, and we believe that in typical circumstances our liability would be so limited in
the event of loss or damage to stored items for which we may be held liable. However, some of our agreements with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no
such limits or contain higher limits or supplemental insurance arrangements. See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" for a description of claims by particular customers seeking to rescind their contracts,
including limitations on liability, as a result of the fires experienced at our South Brunswick Township, New Jersey facilities in 1997.


Environmental Matters

Some of our currently and formerly owned or operated properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the
use or storage of hazardous substances or petroleum products or may have involved the generation of hazardous wastes. In some instances these properties included the operation of underground storage
tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. We have undertaken remediation activities at some of our properties. Although we regularly conduct limited environmental reviews of real
property that we intend to purchase, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our owned and operated properties. Under various federal, state and local
environmental laws, we may be potentially liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and operated properties as well as damages
arising from such contamination. Environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. In addition,
future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today.

We
currently transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy,
which covers all owned and leased locations. Coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs.

Item 2. Properties.

As of December 31, 2003, we conducted operations through 582 leased facilities and 207 facilities that we own or are owned by variable interest entities
that we consolidate. Our facilities are divided among our reportable segments as follows: Business Records Management (524), Off-Site Data Protection (60), International (187) and
Corporate and Other (18). These facilities contain a total of 49.3 million square feet of space. Rent expense was $134.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The leased
facilities typically have initial lease terms of ten years with options to renew for an additional five to ten years. In addition, some of the leases contain either a purchase option or a right of
first refusal upon the sale of the property. Our facilities are located throughout North America, Europe and Latin America, with the largest number of facilities in California, Florida, Illinois, New
Jersey, Texas, Canada and the U.K. We believe that the space available in our facilities is adequate to meet our current needs, although future growth may require that we acquire additional real
property either by leasing or purchasing. See Note 13 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our minimum annual rental commitments.


Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Sequedex, H-W Associates, Pioneer and Pierce Proceedings

On March 28, 2002, Iron Mountain and Iron Mountain Information Management, Inc. ("IMIM"), one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, commenced an action
in the Middlesex County, New Jersey, Superior Court, Chancery Division, captioned Iron Mountain Incorporated and Iron Mountain Information Management, Inc. v. J. Peter Pierce, Sr., Douglas B.
Huntley, J. Michael Gold, Fred A. Mathewson, Jr., Michael DiIanni, J. Anthony Hayden, Pioneer Capital, LLC, and Sequedex, LLC. In the complaint, we alleged that defendant J. Peter Pierce, Sr., a
former member of our Board of Directors and the former President of IMIM until his termination without cause effective June 30, 2000, violated his fiduciary obligations, as well as various
noncompetition and other provisions of an employment agreement with Iron Mountain, dated February 1, 2000, by providing direct and/or indirect financial, management and other support to
defendant Sequedex. Sequedex was established in October 2000, and competed directly with us in the records information management services industry. The complaint also alleged that
Mr. Pierce and certain of the other defendants, who were employed by or affiliated with Pierce Leahy Corp. prior to the merger of Pierce Leahy with Iron Mountain in February 2000,
misappropriated and used our trade secrets and other confidential information. Finally, the complaint asserted claims against Sequedex and others for tortious interference with contractual relations,
against all of the defendants for civil conspiracy in respect of the matters described above, and against defendant Michael DiIanni for breach of his employment agreement with IMIM, dated
September 6, 2000. The litigation seeks injunctions in respect of certain matters and recovery of damages against the defendants.

On
April 12, 2002, Iron Mountain also initiated a related arbitration proceeding against Mr. Pierce before the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Office of the American
Arbitration Association (the "AAA") pursuant to an arbitration clause in the employment agreement between Iron Mountain and Mr. Pierce. In the arbitration, Mr. Pierce counterclaimed for
indemnification of his expenses, including attorneys' fees. We disputed Mr. Pierce's claim. On July 19, 2002, the litigation was stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding.
On February 25, 2003, in response to Iron Mountain's request, the AAA removed the arbitrator. The arbitration proceeding was transferred by agreement of the parties to ADR Options, Inc.
On February 4, 2004, the arbitrator rendered a decision. The arbitrator did not find the evidence provided by us in our action against Mr. Pierce sufficient to rule in our favor on the
particular claims at issue. In addition, the arbitrator ruled that, pursuant to an indemnification provision in Mr. Pierce's employment agreement, we must pay Mr. Pierce's attorneys fees
and costs that
are attributable to this single arbitration. The arbitrator has established a procedure to ascertain the amount of these fees and expenses, which, in any case are not expected to be material to our
financial position or results of operations. We have recently filed a motion to vacate the arbitrator's decision and award in Middlesex County, New Jersey, where the pending action against
Mr. Pierce and others is currently stayed.

On
December 16, 2002, Hartford Windsor Associates, L.P. ("H-W Associates"), Hartford General, LLC, J. Anthony Hayden, Mr. Pierce, Frank Seidman and John H.
Greenwald, Jr. commenced an action in the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, against Iron Mountain Incorporated. In the complaint, the plaintiffs allege that H-W
Associates purchased a warehouse property in Connecticut to serve as a records storage facility, and entered into a lease for the facility with Sequedex, then a competitor of ours, and that the
remaining plaintiffs were limited or general partners of H-W Associates. The plaintiffs also allege that we tortiously interfered with Sequedex's contractual relations with an actual or
prospective customer of Sequedex and, as a result, caused Sequedex to default on its lease to H-W Associates. The complaint seeks damages in excess of $100,000. We have denied the material
allegations in the complaint filed against us by H-W Associates and the other plaintiffs and have since filed counterclaims against the plaintiffs alleging tortious


interference
with our business relationship with one of our longstanding customers. Discovery is proceeding.

Also
on December 16, 2002, Pioneer Capital L.P. ("Pioneer"), Pioneer Capital Genpar, Inc. ("PCG"), the general partner of Pioneer, and Mr. Pierce, the President of
PCG, commenced an action in the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, against Iron Mountain Incorporated, C. Richard Reese, John F. Kenny, Jr., Garry Watzke, Schooner Capital LLC
("Schooner") and Vincent J. Ryan. The named individuals are Directors and/or officers of Iron Mountain and Schooner is a shareholder of Iron Mountain. In the complaint, the plaintiffs allege that the
defendants had numerous conversations and arrangements with Mr. Carr, one of Mr. Pierce's and Pioneer's business partners in a company named Logisteq LLC. The plaintiffs further allege
that, as a result of such conversations and arrangements, defendants conspired to, and did intentionally, interfere with Pioneer's relationship with its partner and Logisteq. The plaintiffs also
allege that defendants damaged Mr. Pierce's reputation in the community by telling Iron Mountain employees and other third parties that Mr. Pierce breached his employment agreement with
Iron Mountain, misappropriated and used Iron Mountain's confidential information, breached his fiduciary duties to Iron Mountain's shareholders and assisted Sequedex, then a competitor of Iron
Mountain, in unfairly competing with Iron Mountain. Finally, the complaint alleges that the business partner in Logisteq taped conversations with Mr. Pierce and others which allegedly violated
privacy laws, that the defendants knew, or should have known, that the tapes were being made without the consent of the individuals and, as a result, Mr. Pierce was harmed. The complaint seeks
damages in excess of $5,000,000. Iron Mountain and the other defendants have challenged the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs' pleadings in each of these cases.

On
September 10, 2003, IMIM filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania in a matter related to the litigation between the Company and Sequedex,
Mr. Pierce and
others disclosed above. The new matter names Sequedex, J. Michael Gold and Peter Hamilton as defendants, and alleges that in 2000 defendants Gold and Hamilton, both former IMIM employees, used
confidential and proprietary business information that they had obtained while employed by IMIM to form their own records management company, Sequedex. The complaint also alleges unlawful interference
with IMIM's contractual relationship with a certain customer and other matters. The defendants filed preliminary objections to our complaint and Iron Mountain has answered those preliminary
objections.

Prior
to the litigation directly pertaining to Mr. Pierce having been filed, in approximately October 2000, three former management employees of IMIM became employed by or
otherwise associated with Sequedex. IMIM commenced actions against these three former employees to enforce its rights under their confidentiality and non-competition agreements. IMIM has
also asserted claims against Sequedex for tortious interference with these agreements, and against both Sequedex and the former employees for misappropriation and use of IMIM's trade secrets and
confidential information.

The
defendants in all three cases have denied the material allegations in IMIM's complaints and asserted various affirmative defenses. In addition, Sequedex and the individual defendants
filed counterclaims against IMIM and third party complaints against Iron Mountain. The counterclaims and third party complaints assert claims for tortious interference with certain contracts and
prospective business relations between Sequedex and its current and potential customers as well as a claim for trade disparagement and defamation. The defendant in one of these actions sought a
declaratory judgment regarding the enforceability of the confidentiality and non-competition agreements at issue in that case and filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to have the
non-competition agreement declared void, or to limit its scope. IMIM and Iron Mountain filed motions in all three cases to dismiss the various counterclaims and third-party complaints. All
of these motions, i.e., the defendants' motion for summary judgment and IMIM's and Iron Mountain's motions to dismiss, were denied by the court following a hearing on May 7, 2002. As previously
disclosed in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, Sequedex furnished a preliminary statement of damages with an


estimate
of compensatory damages of approximately $172 million and an indication that Sequedex intended to seek punitive damages of approximately $1.5 billion. Sequedex is no longer
seeking damages in this amount and in connection with its proposed amended counterclaim, Sequedex has recently furnished a litigation expert's report of damages claiming approximately
$59 million plus approximately $6.6 million of pre-judgment interest. Sequedex has indicated that it also intends to seek punitive damages in an undisclosed amount. Extensive
discovery has been conducted in the three cases and is ongoing; on the basis of that discovery, it is our belief that Sequedex has not produced any material evidence that we or IMIM acted wrongfully
in any respect. Further, limited discovery has been conducted in respect of Sequedex's damages claim; on the basis of that discovery, we do not believe that Sequedex has any foundation, and we believe
that it cannot provide any foundation, for its damages calculations. We believe that the damages calculations submitted by Sequedex are not supported by credible evidence and are subject to serious
legal, methodological and factual deficiencies. A trial of the three actions in which the Sequedex counterclaims and third party complaints have been asserted is scheduled to commence in April of
2004. IMIM, Sequedex and one of the individual defendants recently filed dispositive motions, including motions for summary judgment as to certain of the claims. All of these motions were denied by
the court following a hearing on February 24, 2004.

Discovery
is proceeding in each of these cases, other than the arbitration. We intend to prosecute these actions vigorously, as well as to defend ourselves vigorously against the
counterclaims and the third party complaints.

South Brunswick Fires Litigation

In March 1997, we experienced three fires, all of which authorities have determined were caused by arson. The fires resulted in damage to one and
destruction of another records and information management services facility in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey.

Certain
of our customers or their insurance carriers have asserted claims as a consequence of the destruction of, or damage to, their records as a result of the fires, including claims
with specific requests for compensation and allegations of negligence or other culpability on the part of Iron Mountain. We and our insurers have denied any liability on the part of Iron Mountain as
to all of these claims.

We
are presently aware of five pending lawsuits that have been filed against Iron Mountain by certain of our customers and/or their insurers, and one pending lawsuit filed by the
insurers of an abutter of one of the South Brunswick facilities. Five of these six lawsuits have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the Middlesex County, New Jersey, Superior
Court. The sixth lawsuit, brought by a single customer, is pending in the Supreme Court for New York County, New York. A seventh lawsuit, also brought by a single customer, was tried before a federal
judge in New Jersey in February 2000, with a defendant's verdict entered in favor of Iron Mountain. An eighth lawsuit filed by an injured firefighter is currently being settled by our insurer
for a nominal amount. Several other claims that were originally filed in relation to these lawsuits have been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by the customers, abutting business owners, and/or
their insurance carriers.

We
have denied liability and asserted affirmative defenses in all of the remaining cases arising out of the fires and, in certain of the cases, have asserted counterclaims for
indemnification against the plaintiffs. Discovery is ongoing. We deny any liability as a result of the destruction of, or damage to, customer records or property of abutters as a result of the fires,
which were beyond our control. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these and any other lawsuits that may arise.

Our
professional liability insurer, together with our general liability and property insurance carriers, have entered into a binding agreement with us regarding reimbursement of defense
costs and have agreed to ongoing discussions regarding any remaining coverage issues, further defense and/or settlement of these claims.


General

In addition to the matters discussed above, we are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business with a portion of the defense
and/or settlement costs being covered by various commercial liability insurance policies purchased by us. In the opinion of management, no other material legal proceedings are pending to which we, or
any of our properties, are subject.

The
outcome of the South Brunswick fires, Sequedex, H-W Associates, Pioneer and Pierce proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Based on our present assessment of the
situation, after consultation with legal counsel, management does not believe that the outcome of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations, although there can be no assurance in this regard.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders of Iron Mountain during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003.

upon our financial condition, results of operations and business requirements. Our Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated March 15, 2002 (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement")
contains provisions that limit the amount of cash dividends we may pay and stock repurchases that we may make.

On
February 1, 2000, we completed a merger with Pierce Leahy in a transaction valued at approximately $1,036,000. The results of the Pierce Leahy merger are reflected in the
table above beginning with 11 months of activity in 2000. In addition, we recorded specific charges associated with the integration of the operations of Pierce Leahy in 2000, 2001 and 2002
within merger related expenses and recorded non-cash stock option compensation expense as a result of the Pierce Leahy acquisition in 2000. This merger impacts the comparability of results
before and after the merger.

(2)

Effective
January 1, 2002, we ceased amortizing our goodwill balance in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets." The accounting change impacts the comparability of results to previous years. See Note 2(g) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

(3)

OIBDA
is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses. OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing OIBDA by total revenues. For a more detailed definition and
reconciliation of OIBDA and a discussion of why we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Measures."

(4)

We
reported a loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and minority interest for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001. We would have needed to
generate for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 additional income from operations before provision for income taxes and minority interest of $23,291 and $28,111, respectively, to cover
our fixed charges of $154,975 and $177,032, respectively.


Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" and the Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing.

This
discussion contains "forward-looking statements," as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other federal securities laws. See
"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" on page ii of this filing.

Overview

Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service and storage material sales revenues. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance
indicator for the records and information management services industry, consist of largely recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials (either on a per unit or per cubic foot of
records basis), which are typically retained by customers for many years, and have accounted for approximately 58% of total consolidated revenues in each of the last five years. Our quarterly revenues
from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 60 consecutive quarters. In certain circumstances, based upon customer requirements, storage revenues include periodic charges associated with
normal, recurring service activities. Service and storage material sales revenues are comprised of charges for related service activities and courier operations and the sale of storage materials.
Related service revenues arise from additions of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, destructions of records, permanent withdrawals from storage and
other complementary and ancillary services, and sales of specially designed storage containers, magnetic media including computer tapes and related supplies. Courier operations consist primarily of
the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request. Customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms. Our consolidated revenues are subject to
variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenue derived from outside the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we derived 19.0% and 14.0%,
respectively, of our total revenues from outside the U.S. We expect the percentage of total revenues that we derive from outside the U.S. to increase in 2004 due to our acquisition of the European
operations of Hays IMS.

Cost
of sales (excluding depreciation) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs including rent and utilities, transportation expenses
including vehicle leases and fuel, other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Trends in
total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets,
workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation. Trends in facility occupancy costs are similarly impacted by the total number of facilities
we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties.

The
expansion of our European and secure shredding operations have resulted in changes to the mix of certain cost of sales components. We expect that until we complete the integration of
the European operations of Hays IMS, rationalize our European facilities and maximize their utilization, our facilities costs may increase as a percentage of consolidated
revenue

,

as our European operations become a greater percentage of our consolidated results. Our European and secure shredding operations are more labor
intensive; therefore, our labor expense will be higher as a percentage of revenue as compared to our mature operations. In addition, our secure shredding operations incur higher transportation costs
and lower facility costs, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as compared to our mature operations.


Selling,
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing
personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars
and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability
in costs associated with medical insurance. We expect our adoption of the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended by SFAS No. 148,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure," will result in increasing amounts of selling, general and administrative expenses in the future. We began using the
fair value method of accounting in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for
all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. As we continue to grant new options subject to these standards and amortize
compensation expense associated with options granted after January 1, 2003, we expect our stock compensation expense will grow significantly over the $1.5 million we recorded for such
expense in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003. It is not possible to predict the increase in stock compensation expense for 2004 as it is
dependent upon the number of options that will be granted throughout 2004 and the valuation assumptions in use at the time those options are granted. The overhead structure of our expanding European
operations, as compared to our mature operations, is more labor intensive and has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage, which may result in an increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results.

Our
depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital-intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which
include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationships and acquisition costs.

Effective
July 1, 2001 and January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 141 requires
all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives. Had SFAS No. 142 been effective January 1, 2001, goodwill amortization expense would have been reduced by $59.2 million
($50.9 million, net of tax) for the year ended December 31, 2001. See Note 2(g) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
February 2004, we completed the acquisition of Mentmore plc's 49.9% equity interest in IME. This transaction should have no impact on revenue or operating income since we
already fully consolidate IME's financial results. Since we will be using the purchase method of accounting for this acquisition, 49.9% of the net assets of IME will be adjusted to reflect their fair
market value if different from their current carrying value. As a result, we expect this transaction will increase depreciation and amortization expenses going forward. Additionally, we will record an
increase in interest expense, net associated with debt used to fund this acquisition and will no longer record the minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries, net related to Mentmore's ownership
interest in IME.

All
of our costs are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on costs incurred by our entities outside the U.S. During 2003, we have seen increases
in costs as a result of the strengthening of the British pound sterling, the Euro, and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable
periods. It is impossible to predict how much foreign currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future and how those


fluctuations
will impact individual balances reported in our consolidated statement of operations; however, given the relative increase in our international operations, these fluctuations may become
material.

Reclassifications and Changes in Presentation

Previously, consolidated losses (gains) on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net were recorded within various captions of our consolidated
statements of operations based on the nature
of the underlying asset. During the first quarter of 2003, we determined that it was more appropriate to record these gains and losses separately within our results from operations. We have reflected
this change in all applicable tables and discussions for all periods presented within the following discussion of results of operations.

Previously,
debt extinguishment expenses were recorded as an extraordinary charge within our consolidated statements of operations. Effective January 1, 2003, we have reflected
these charges to other (income) expense, net in accordance with recent changes in accounting pronouncements. We have reflected this change in all applicable tables and discussions for all periods
presented within the following discussion of results of operations.

Non-GAAP Measures

Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or OIBDA

OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses. OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing OIBDA by total revenues. Our management
uses these measures to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated business. As such, we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential
investors. We use OIBDA for planning purposes and multiples of current or projected OIBDA-based calculations in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise
valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe OIBDA and OIBDA Margin are useful measures to evaluate our ability to grow our revenues faster than our operating expenses and they are an
integral part of our internal reporting system utilized by management to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. OIBDA does not include certain items, specifically
(1) minority interest in earnings (losses) of subsidiaries, net, (2) other (income) expense, net, (3) income from discontinued operations and loss on sale of discontinued
operations and (4) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and
the provision for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which management does not consider when evaluating the profitability of our core operations.
Finally, OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which management believes is better evaluated by comparing capital
expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. OIBDA and OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of
financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America, or GAAP, such as operating or net income or cash flows from operating
activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP).

Critical Accounting Policies

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then
ended. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the estimates used, including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, impairments of tangible and intangible assets, income taxes,
purchase accounting related reserves, self-insurance liabilities, incentive compensation liabilities, litigation liabilities and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical
experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. We use these estimates to assist us in the identification and assessment of the accounting treatment
necessary with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following and are in no particular order:

Accounting for Acquisitions

Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence
of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning, and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as
we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources.

Each
acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition, including,
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, "Accounting for Business Combinations," and more recently, SFAS No. 141. Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization
of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of
acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment. These estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating leases and
deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. We are not aware of any information that would


indicate
that the final purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in 2003 would differ meaningfully from preliminary estimates. See Note 7 to Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

In
connection with each of our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings. Our restructuring
activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities, reductions in staffing levels, and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire. The estimated cost
of these restructuring activities are included as costs of the acquisition and are recorded as goodwill consistent with the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue
No. 95-3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination." While we finalize our plans to restructure the businesses we acquire within one year of
the date of acquisition, it may take more than one year to complete all activities related to the restructuring of an acquired business.

Our
acquisitions have resulted in a significant accumulation of goodwill. Beginning on January 1, 2002, we ceased to amortize goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142. We
reviewed goodwill for impairment consistent with the guidelines of SFAS No. 142 using a discounted future cash flow approach to approximate fair value. The result of testing our goodwill for
impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, as of January 1, 2002, was a non-cash charge of $6.4 million (net of minority interest of $8.5 million), which,
consistent with SFAS No. 142, is reported in the caption "cumulative effect of change in accounting principle" in our consolidated statement of operations. Impairment adjustments recognized in
the future, if any, are generally required to be recognized as operating expenses. The $6.4 million charge relates to our South American reporting unit within our international reporting
segment. The South American reporting unit failed the impairment test primarily due to a reduction in the expected future performance of the unit resulting from a deterioration of the local economic
environment and the devaluation of the currency in Argentina. As goodwill amortization expense in our South American reporting unit is not deductible for tax purposes, this impairment charge is not
net of a tax benefit. We have a controlling 50.1% interest in Iron Mountain South America, Ltd ("IMSA") and the remainder is owned by an unaffiliated entity. IMSA has acquired a controlling
interest in entities in which local partners have retained a minority interest in order to enhance our local market expertise. These local partners have no ownership interest in IMSA. This has caused
the minority interest portion of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge ($8.5 million) to exceed our portion of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge
($6.4 million). In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of
October 1, 2003 and noted no impairment of goodwill at our reporting units as of that date. As of December 31, 2003, no factors were identified that would alter this assessment.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments. When
calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable
balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the
allowance may be required. As of December 31, 2002 and 2003, our allowance for doubtful accounts balance totaled $20.3 million and $18.3 million, respectively. The decrease in the
allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 is primarily attributable to the success of our centralized collection efforts within the U.S. and
Canada, which resulted in improved cash collections and an improved accounts receivable aging that enabled us to significantly reduce our allowance for doubtful accounts in the year ended
December 31, 2003. The decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts was partially offset by an increase in the


allowance
for doubtful accounts associated with businesses acquired during the year ended December 31, 2003, including Hays IMS.

Accounting for Variable Interest Entities

Three variable interest entities were established to acquire properties and lease those properties to us. These leases were designed to qualify as operating
leases for accounting purposes, where the monthly lease expense was recorded as rent expense in our consolidated statements of operations and where the related underlying assets and liabilities were
not consolidated in our consolidated balance sheets. We changed the characterization and the related accounting for properties in one variable interest entity ("VIE III") during the third quarter of
2002 and prospectively for new property acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2002. In addition, anticipating the requirement to consolidate, and in line with our objective of transparent reporting,
we voluntarily guaranteed all of the at-risk equity in VIE III and our two other variable interest entities (together, the "Other Variable Interest Entities" and, collectively with VIE
III, our "Variable Interest Entities") as of December 31, 2002. These guarantees resulted in our consolidating all of our Variable Interest Entities' assets and liabilities.

Our
Variable Interest Entities were financed with real estate term loans. These real estate term loans have always been and continue to be treated as indebtedness for purposes of our
financial covenants under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of the date they were consolidated into our financial statements, they were also considered indebtedness under our indentures
for certain of our senior subordinated notes. As of December 31, 2003, these real estate term loans amounted to $202.6 million. No further financing is currently available to our
Variable Interest Entities to fund further property acquisitions. See Note 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As
of December 31, 2002, we voluntarily guaranteed all of the at-risk equity in VIE III. This resulted in our consolidating all of its remaining assets and
liabilities. VIE III's remaining assets and liabilities relate to an interest rate swap agreement, which it entered into upon its inception. This swap agreement hedges the majority of interest rate
risk associated with VIE III's real estate term loans. Specifically, VIE III has swapped $97.0 million of floating rate debt to fixed rate debt. Since the time it entered into the swap
agreement, interest rates have fallen. As a result, the estimated fair value of the derivative liability held by VIE III, and now consolidated on our balance sheet, related to the swap agreement was
$11.0 million at December 31, 2003. This swap has been since inception and continues to be, as of December 31, 2003, an effective hedge in accordance with SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, we recorded depreciation expense of $1.7 million and
$1.8 million, respectively, associated with the properties and interest expense of $6.2 million and $8.2 million, respectively, associated with the real estate term loans. See
Notes 3, 4 and 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
addition, as of December 31, 2002, we voluntarily guaranteed all of the at-risk equity in the Other Variable Interest Entities. This resulted in our consolidating
all of their assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2002, the total impact of consolidating the Other Variable Interest Entities was an increase of $103.9 million both in property,
plant and equipment and long-term debt. The underlying leases associated with the Other Variable Interest Entities were treated as operating leases from inception (as early as 1998)
through consolidation on December 31, 2002. As a result, during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, we recorded $6.7 million and $5.9 million, respectively, in rent
expense in our consolidated statements of operations related to these leases. In 2003, we began recording depreciation expense associated with the properties, interest expense associated with the real
estate term loans and no longer have rent expense related to leases associated with the Other Variable Interest Entities in our consolidated financial results. During the year ended
December 31, 2003, we recorded depreciation expense of $2.0 million associated with the properties and interest expense of $5.5 million associated with the real estate term loans.
If the Other Variable Interest Entities had been consolidated in our historical financial statements as of January 1, 2002: (1) depreciation expense would


have
increased in an amount equal to $2.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002; and (2) rent expense for these properties would have been reclassified as interest
expense in an amount equal to $5.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002. Consequently, our OIBDA, operating income and interest expense would have increased by
$5.9 million, $3.9 million and $5.9 million, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002. In addition, net income before provision for income taxes would
have decreased by $2.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002.

In
January and December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46") and No. 46, revised ("FIN 46R"),
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." These statements, which address perceived weaknesses in accounting for entities commonly known as special-purpose or off-balance-sheet,
require consolidation of certain interests or arrangements by virtue of holding a controlling financial interest in such entities. Certain provisions of FIN 46R related to interests in special purpose
entities were applicable for the period ended December 31, 2003. We must apply FIN 46R to our interests in all entities subject to the interpretation
as of the first interim or annual period ending after March 15, 2004. Adoption of this new method of accounting for variable interest entities did not and is not expected to have a material
impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. As a result of the actions described above, as of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003, we did not have any
unconsolidated variable interest entities.

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives), and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on its balance
sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (1) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a
recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment; (2) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction; or (3) a hedge of the foreign currency
exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an available-for-sale security, or a foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction.
The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized each period as other
comprehensive income which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items included in shareholders' equity, assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. See
Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description of our derivative instruments.

In
order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The
effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are
recorded currently in earnings.

For
fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the effective portions
of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For hedges of foreign currency the accounting
treatment generally follows the treatment for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge.

Although
we apply some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is
such that the


correlation
of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high. We had $25.6 million of interest rate risk management liabilities and had a corresponding
amount for unrealized losses to other comprehensive income ($16.2 million, net of tax) related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2003.

We
provided the initial financing totaling 190.5 million British pounds sterling to IME, our European joint venture, for all of the consideration associated with the acquisition
of the European operations of Hays IMS using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We recorded a foreign currency gain of $27.8 million in other (income) expense, net
for this intercompany balance for the year ended December 31, 2003. In order to minimize the foreign currency risk associated with providing IME with the consideration necessary for the
acquisition of Hay IMS, we borrowed 80.0 million British pounds sterling under our revolving credit facility to create a natural hedge. We recorded a foreign currency loss of
$11.5 million on the translation of this revolving credit balance to U.S. dollars in other (income) expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2003. In addition, we entered into two
cross currency swaps with a combined notional value of 100.0 million British pounds sterling. These swaps each have a term of one year and at maturity we have a right to receive
$162.8 million in exchange for 100.0 million British pounds sterling. We have not designated these swaps as hedges and, therefore, all mark to market fluctuations of the swaps are
recorded in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of operations. We have recorded, for the year ended December 31, 2003, a foreign currency loss of $19.0 million in
other (income) expense, net.

One
of our interest rate swaps was used to hedge interest rate risk on certain variable operating lease commitments. As a result of the December 31, 2002 consolidation of one of
the Other Variable Interest Entities ("VIE I"), the operating lease commitments that were hedged by this swap are now considered to be inter-company transactions and we determined that this hedge was
no longer effective on a prospective basis. We have consolidated the real estate term loans of VIE I and we will prospectively record interest expense instead of rent expense as we make cash interest
payments on this debt. The unrealized mark to market losses previously recorded in other comprehensive income attributable to this swap ($1.9 million and $0.8 million, net of tax, as of
December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively) will be amortized through other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statement of operations based on the changes in the fair value of the swap
each period that the remaining interest payments are made on VIE I's external debt. We are accounting for mark to market changes in the derivative liability of this swap agreement through other
(income) expense, net in our consolidated statement of operations. This accounting has a net zero impact within our consolidated statement of operations as it relates to the amortization of unrealized
mark to market losses and the fair valuing of the derivative liability.

Accounting for Internal Use Software

We develop various software applications for internal use. We account for those costs in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position ("SOP")
98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." SOP 98-1 requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to
be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. SOP 98-1 also defines which types of costs should be capitalized and which should be expensed. Payroll and related
costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects, to the extent time is spent directly on the project, are
capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the project will
be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are evaluated for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No.144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."


It
may be necessary for us to write-off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. Our expansion into
new technology-based service offerings requires the development of internal use software that will be susceptible to rapid and significant changes in technology. We may be required to
write-off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the software's estimated
useful life. General uncertainties related to expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and market acceptance of our services, may adversely impact the recoverability of
these assets. See Note 2(f) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

During
the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, we replaced internal use software programs, which resulted in the write-off to loss on disposal/writedown of
property, plant and equipment, net of the remaining net book value of $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively.

Deferred Income Taxes

We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered estimated future
taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount needed for the valuation allowance. If actual results differ unfavorably from those estimates used, we may not be able to
realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets and additional valuation allowances may be required.

Stock-based Compensation

As of January 1, 2003, we adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148. As a result we began using the fair value
method of accounting in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards
granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. We will apply the fair value recognition provisions to all stock based awards granted,
modified or settled on or after January 1, 2003 and will continue to provide the required pro forma information for all awards previously granted, modified or settled before January 1,
2003 in our consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded $1.7 million of stock compensation expense in our consolidated statement of
operations. Had we elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of all options as of their grant dates as prescribed by SFAS No. 123 and No. 148, we would have recorded
stock compensation expense of $4.9 million, $4.5 million and $5.6 million in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003,
respectively.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2003 to Year Ended December 31, 2002

Revenue

Our consolidated storage revenues increased $115.5 million, or 15.2%, to $875.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase is
attributable to internal revenue growth (8%) resulting from net increases in records and other media stored by existing customers and sales to new customers, acquisitions (5%), primarily consisting of
$30.0 million from the operations of Hays IMS, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (2%). Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations were primarily due to the strengthening of the
British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, and Euro against the U.S. dollar, offset by a weakening of the Mexican peso and Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted
average rates for the comparable periods.

Consolidated
service and storage material sales revenues increased $67.3 million, or 12.0%, to $626.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase is
attributable to acquisitions (7%), including revenue from the Hays IMS operations of $24.6 million, internal revenue growth (3%) resulting from net increases in service and storage material
sales to existing customers and sales to new customers, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (2%). Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations were primarily due to the strengthening of the
British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, and Euro against the U.S. dollar, offset by a weakening of the Mexican peso and Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted
average rates for the comparable periods.

For
the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $182.8 million, or 13.9%, to $1,501.3 million. Internal revenue growth for the year ended
December 31, 2003 was 6%. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations.

Our internal revenue growth rate represents the weighted average year over year growth rate of our revenues after removing the effects of
acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Over the past eight quarters, the internal growth rate of our storage revenues has ranged between 8% to 9%. Our storage revenue internal
growth rate trend for the year ended December 31, 2003 reflects higher growth rates in our international businesses, primarily Europe, stabilized net carton volume growth in our North American
records management business and higher growth rates in our digital businesses. We experienced higher volumes of carton destructions and permanent removals in the fourth quarter of 2003 as compared to
the first three quarters of 2003, which contributed to the decline in our internal growth rate for storage revenue from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2003. We experienced similar volumes
of destructions and permanent removals in the fourth quarter of 2002. Net carton volume growth is a function of the rate new cartons are added by existing and new customers offset by the rate of
carton destructions and other permanent removals.

The
internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage revenue internal growth rate due to more discretionary services we
offer such as large special projects, data products and carton sales and recycled paper. These revenues are impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase
of these services as a way to reduce their short-term costs. As a commodity, recycled paper prices are subject to the volatility


of
that market. The quarterly growth rates in 2003 were negatively impacted by several factors: (1) large special project service revenue did not achieve the same high levels experienced in the
corresponding periods of 2002, (2) product sales, primarily data product sales, decreased and (3) carton destructions and other permanent removals have decreased relative to prior
periods. In addition, our off-site data protection business continued to operate in a market experiencing downward pressure on information technology spending as companies look to reduce
their costs.

Labor

Labor expense decreased as a percentage of revenue as a result of improved labor management in our North American operations and lower incentive compensation
expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. This improvement was offset by increases in wages, medical expenses, and headcount due to
growth and acquisitions in our secure shredding operations and the acquisition of Hays IMS. We expect labor expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues in 2004 may increase as we report a full
year of integrated Hays IMS operations.

Facilities

The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which increased $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily as a
result of increased rent in our European operations of $9.0 million attributable to new facilities and properties acquired through acquisitions, including our acquisition of Hays IMS. In
addition, after adjusting for the consolidation of properties owned by our Variable Interest Entities, we have increased the number of leased facilities we occupy in the U.S. and Canada as of
December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 primarily due to acquisitions. The increase in rent is offset by the consolidation of 38 properties owned by our Variable Interest
Entities during the third and fourth quarter of 2002. The leases associated with these properties were accounted for as operating leases prior to December 31, 2002. We recorded
$5.9 million of rent expense for these 38 properties during the year ended December 31, 2002 and no rent expense in the year ended December 31, 2003. Rather than rent expense, we
recorded interest expense and depreciation expense associated with these properties for the year ended December 31, 2003. Excluding our European operations, the dollar increase in facilities
expenses is attributable to property taxes, utilities, and property insurance, which increased $5.5 million, $4.0 million, and $1.9 million, respectively, for the year ended
December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Facilities expenses in our European operations increased $6.4 million primarily due to the growth of operations and
acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002.


We
anticipate that reporting a full year of integrated Hays IMS operations and no longer having the offsetting impact caused by our Variable Interest Entities could cause an increase in rent expense
and possibly in total facility costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues in 2004.

Transportation

Our transportation expenses, which were flat as a percentage of consolidated revenues, are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles,
owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses, and maintenance. In the year ended December 31, 2003, we experienced a $3.4 million increase in transportation
expenses in our European operations as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, which is primarily attributable to an increase in fleet size and vehicles under operating lease resulting
from the acquisition of Hays IMS and growth of operations. Transportation efficiencies achieved in our North American operations, partially offset by higher fuel costs and an increased percentage of
vehicles under operating lease, mitigated the impact of our European operations on transportation expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues.

Product Cost of Sales and Other Cost of Sales

Product and other cost of sales are highly correlated to complementary revenue streams. Product cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 was
lower than the year ended December 31, 2002 as a percentage of product revenues due to more focused selling efforts on higher margin products and improved product sourcing.

General and Administrative

The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 is primarily attributable
to a $16.4 million increase in general and administrative expenses in our European operations due to the growth of operations and acquisitions. In our North American operations, general and
administrative expenses increased as a result of higher wages due to normal inflation and merit increases, and increases in worker's compensation and medical expenses. The increase in labor expenses
was partially offset by decreases in general insurance expenses and lower incentive compensation expenses. We anticipate increased pressure on our general and administrative expenses as a percentage
of consolidated revenues as we integrate the operations of Hays IMS.


Sales, Marketing & Account Management

The majority of our sales, marketing and account management costs are labor related and are primarily driven by the headcount in each of these departments.
Increased headcount and commissions are the most significant contributors to the increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2003. Throughout the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, we continued to invest in the expansion and improvement of our sales force and account management personnel.
Excluding our European operations, since December 31, 2002, we added 66 sales and marketing employees, a 16% increase in headcount, increased our account management force and initiated several
new marketing and promotional efforts to develop awareness in the marketplace of our entire service offerings. The costs associated with these efforts have contributed to the increase in our sales,
marketing and account management expenses. In addition, costs associated with our European sales and account management teams increased by $4.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, due to the hiring of new personnel and the expansion of our European sales force. We expect that sales, marketing and account management
expenses will continue to increase as a percentage of consolidated revenues as we continue to expand and train our sales force and develop new marketing initiatives.

Information Technology

Information technology expenses increased $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 principally due to higher compensation costs resulting
from increased headcount, normal inflation and merit increases, as well as an increase in external resources, which was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses. As our technology
initiatives mature, less of our efforts are development related, thus decreasing capitalizable expenditures, which results in increased information technology expenses. In addition, we incurred
additional costs to expand bandwidth and international connectivity in the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 to satisfy growth of our business
and to integrate acquisitions.

Bad Debt Expense

The decrease in consolidated bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 is primarily
attributable to the success of our centralized collection efforts within the U.S. and Canada during 2002 and 2003, which resulted in improved cash collections and an improved accounts receivable aging
that enabled us to significantly reduce our allowance for doubtful accounts in the year ended December 31, 2003. We do not expect to experience a similar decrease during 2004 and expect bad
debt expense to be approximately 0.5% of consolidated revenues in 2004.

Depreciation, Amortization, Merger-Related Expenses and Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $21.9 million to $130.9 million (8.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2003 from $109.0 million (8.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. Depreciation expense increased $19.8 million, primarily due to
the additional depreciation expense related to recent capital expenditures, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and
software, and buildings, and depreciation associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Depreciation associated with our digital initiatives increased $5.4 million during the year
ended December 31, 2003 as a result of software and hardware assets placed in service throughout the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003. The consolidation of the properties owned by
our Variable Interest Entities during the year ended December 31, 2002 resulted in $2.2 million of additional depreciation in the year ended December 31, 2003. Amortization
expense increased as a


result
of the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions we completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 and during the year ended December 31, 2003.

Merger-related
expenses are certain expenses directly related to our merger with Pierce Leahy that cannot be capitalized and included system conversion costs, costs of exiting certain
facilities, severance, relocation and pay-to-stay payments and other transaction-related costs. Merger-related expenses were $0.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002. All merger related activities associated with the Pierce Leahy merger were completed in 2002.

Consolidated
loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net consisted of disposals and asset writedowns partially offset by $4.2 million of gains on the sale of
properties in Texas, Florida and the U.K. in the year ended December 31, 2003 and a gain of $2.1 million on the sale of a property in the U.K. in the year ended December 31, 2002.

Operating Income

As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $52.3 million, or 20.7%, to $304.9 million (20.3% of consolidated
revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $252.6 million (19.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002.

OIBDA

As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated OIBDA increased $74.2 million, or 20.5%, to $435.8 million (29.0% of consolidated revenues) for
the year ended December 31, 2003 from $361.6 million (27.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Interest Expense, Net

Consolidated interest expense, net increased $13.8 million to $150.5 million (10.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31,
2003 from $136.6 million (10.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily attributable to (1) $7.4 million of interest
expense associated with real estate term loans held by our Variable Interest Entities that were consolidated in the second half of 2002, (2) borrowings under our revolving credit facility and
the issuance of our 6


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 (the "6


/


% notes") which were used to finance the Hays IMS acquisition, and (3) an increase in our
overall weighted average outstanding borrowings. The increase was offset by a decline in our overall weighted average interest rate from 8.3% as of December 31, 2002 to 7.7% as of
December 31, 2003 resulting from our refinancing efforts and a decline in variable interest rates.

Foreign
currency gains of $30.2 million based on period-end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily due to the strengthening
of the Canadian dollar and British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with our Canadian and U.K. subsidiaries, U.S. dollar denominated debt
held by our Canadian subsidiary,


borrowings
denominated in foreign currencies under our revolving credit facility, and our British pound sterling denominated cross currency swap.

During
the year ended December 31, 2003, we redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of our 9


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007 (the
"9


/


% notes"), resulting in a charge of $1.8 million, the remaining outstanding principal amount of our 8


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009 (the
"8


/


% notes"), resulting in a charge of $13.8 million, and $115.0 million of the outstanding principal of the 8


/


% Senior Notes due 2008 of our Canadian
subsidiary (the "Subsidiary notes"), resulting in a charge of $12.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded a charge of $1.2 million related to the early
retirement of debt in conjunction with the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and a charge of $4.2 million related to the early retirement of a portion of our 9


/


%
notes. The charges consisted primarily of the call and tender premiums associated with the extinguished debt and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing cost and discounts.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 42.5%. The primary reconciling item between the statutory rate of 35% and our effective tax
rate is state income taxes (net of federal benefit). The disallowance of certain intercompany interest charges by states, including a change in
Massachusetts tax laws, retroactive to January 1, 2002, increased our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2003 by 1.1%. Our effective tax rate was 41.3% for the
year ended December 31, 2002. There may be future volatility with respect to our effective tax rate related to items including unusual unforecasted permanent items, significant changes in tax
rates in foreign jurisdictions and the need for additional valuation allowances. Also, as a result of our net operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay any significant international, U.S.
federal and state income taxes during 2004.

Minority Interest, Discontinued Operations, and Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

Minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries, net resulted in a charge to income of $5.6 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2003 compared to $3.6 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. This represents our minority partners' share of earnings in our
majority-owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results. The increase is a result of the improved profitability of our European and South American businesses.

In
the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $1.1 million (net of tax of $0.8 million) as a result of resolving several outstanding
contingencies remaining from the sale of the Arcus Staffing Resources, Inc. business unit in 1999. There was no such income recorded in 2003.

In
the first quarter of 2002, we recorded a non-cash charge for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $6.4 million (net of minority interest of
$8.5 million) as a result of our implementation of SFAS No. 142. There was no such charge in 2003.

Net Income

As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated net income increased $26.3 million, or 45.2%, to $84.6 million (5.6% of consolidated revenues)
for the year ended December 31, 2003 from net income of $58.3 million (4.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Business Records Management

During the year ended December 31, 2003, revenue in our business records management segment increased 8.2% primarily due to increased storage revenues,
growth of our secure shredding operations and acquisitions (including revenue from the U.S. operations of Hays IMS of $8.2 million), and was offset by lower special project service revenue and
lower permanent removal and destruction fees. In addition, favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2003 in Canada increased revenue $9.6 million when compared
to the year ended December 31, 2002. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to lower bad debt expense and lower incentive compensation expense which were partially
offset by higher property taxes, utilities and our increased investment in our sales and account management force. Items excluded from the calculation of Contribution include the following:
(1) depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 of $71.7 million compared to $67.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
(2) foreign currency gains of $29.5 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and (3) gain on disposal/writedown of
property plant and equipment, net of


$0.6 million
for the year ended December 31, 2003 and a loss on disposal/writedown of property plant and equipment, net of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2002.

Off-Site Data Protection

Revenue in our off-site data protection segment increased 5.0% primarily due to internal revenue growth from both existing and new customers in the
face of increasing pressure in the marketplace to reduce information technology related spending. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to reduced bad debt expense,
increased product sales margins and improved labor management. This increase was partially offset by the growth of our sales and account management force. Items excluded from the calculation of
Contribution include the following: (1) depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 of $13.8 million compared to $12.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002 and (2) a loss on disposal/writedown of property plant and equipment, net of $1.9 million and $0.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

International

Revenue in our international segment increased 81.1% primarily due to acquisitions completed in Europe, including $46.4 million from the acquisition of
Hays IMS, and in South America, as well as increased sales efforts and a large service project in the U.K. Favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2003 in Europe
increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $17.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was offset by $1.2 million of unfavorable currency
fluctuations in Mexico and South America during the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased
primarily due to improved gross margins from our European, South American, and Mexican operations and overall increased direct labor utilization and lower bad debt expenses. This increase was
partially offset by increased overhead expenses associated with the growth of these emerging businesses. Items excluded from the calculation of Contribution include the following:
(1) depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 of $16.0 million compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002,
including $3.6 million associated with the acquisition of Hays IMS in the year ended December 31, 2003, (2) gains on disposal/writedown of property plant and equipment, net of
$0.8 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and (3) a foreign currency gain of $1.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2003 compared to a loss of $0.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2002.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2002 to Year Ended December 31, 2001

Revenue

For the year ended December 31, 2002, our consolidated revenues increased $132.8 million, or 11.2%, compared to the same period of 2001. This
increase was principally a result of internal revenue growth, which for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 10%, comprised of 8% for storage revenue and 11% for service and storage material
sales revenue. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations.

Consolidated
storage revenues increased $65.1 million, or 9.4%, to $759.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily attributable to
internal revenue growth of 8% resulting from net increases in records and other media stored by existing customers and sales to new customers. The net effect of foreign currency translation on storage
revenues was a decrease in revenue of $2.4 million. This was a result of a weakening of the Argentine peso, the Canadian dollar, and the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, offset by a
strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods.

Consolidated
service and storage material sales revenues increased $67.7 million, or 13.8%, to $559.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was
primarily attributable to internal revenue growth of 11% resulting from net increases in service and storage material sales to existing customers and sales to new customers. The net effect of foreign
currency translation on service and storage material sales revenues was a decrease in revenue of $0.7 million. This was a result of a weakening of the Argentine peso, the Canadian dollar, and
the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, offset by a strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the
comparable periods.

The consecutive quarter storage revenue internal growth trend over the last eight quarters, as calculated quarterly comparing the current quarter
to the applicable quarter in the prior year, is primarily attributable to a decline in the rate at which customers have added new cartons to their inventory, which may be a result of current economic
conditions. However, we have not seen a decline in the duration that our customers maintain their cartons in inventory nor an increase in the rate of cartons destroyed or permanently removed from
inventory as a percentage of the total population. In addition, growth from new sales was adversely affected in 2001 and 2002 as a result of the disruption caused by the merging of our sales force
with that of Pierce Leahy in 2000. The sales force reorganization has been completed and growth from new sales has begun to increase.

Service
and storage material sales revenue internal growth is subject to fluctuations in the timing of non-recurring service projects ordered by customers and in some cases
can be affected by delays or cancellations as some customers seek to reduce short-term costs. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we benefited from a number of large
non-recurring service projects in North America and Europe. The volatility in the service revenue growth for the third and fourth quarters of 2001 and 2002 is primarily due to a disruption
in the normal pattern of services we provide to our customers following


the
events of September 11, 2001 and the resulting shift of some services and related revenue, to the fourth quarter of 2001. This caused a favorable comparison for the service revenue growth
rate in the third quarter of 2002 and a difficult comparison in the fourth quarter of 2002.

Labor

The dollar increase in labor expense is primarily attributable to increases in headcount and changes in our labor mix resulting from the expansion of our secure
shredding operations. Our secure shredding operations are more labor intensive, therefore, labor expense will be higher as a percentage of revenue as compared to our mature operations. In the year
ended December 31, 2002, this impact was mitigated by improved labor management in our off-site data protection segment. In addition, our operations in the U.S. and Canada, which
comprise approximately 75% of our workforce, experienced an overall increase in wages due to normal inflation, merit increases and significant increases in medical insurance and worker's compensation
expenses of approximately $12.0 million. The majority of these increases are attributable to higher premiums and self-insurance requirements.

Facilities

Our property management activities combined with a higher utilization of our space has driven the decrease of our facilities expenses as a percentage of
consolidated revenues from 14.6% in the year ended December 31, 2001 to 14.0% in the year ended December 31, 2002. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which
decreased $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. We reduced the number of leased facilities we occupy by 23 in the year ended December 31, 2002 primarily through the
consolidation of our property portfolio as we exited less desirable facilities and consolidated our remaining properties subsequent to the Pierce Leahy merger.

The
decrease in leased properties is also a result of the recharacterization of eight properties held by our Variable Interest Entities at the end of 2001, which are now consolidated on
our balance sheet at the end of 2002. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, we recorded $1.8 million and $0.0 million of rent expense for these eight properties,
respectively. An additional 23 properties held by our Variable Interest Entities were consolidated as of December 31, 2002; however, they were accounted for as operating leases during the year
ended December 31, 2002 and their costs were included in rent expense. For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, we recorded rent expense of $6.7 million and
$5.9 million, respectively, on these 23 properties and we recorded rent expense as interest expense beginning in 2003.


The
dollar increase in facilities expenses is attributable to property insurance, which increased $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the year
ended December 31, 2001. The market-wide increase in property insurance premiums in the wake of the events of September 11, 2001, in addition to experience based annual
premium adjustments, resulted in this dramatic increase. Increased rent and facilities expenses in our European operations of $4.6 million and higher property taxes in the U.S. and Canada of
$1.8 million have also contributed to the dollar increase in facilities expenses.

Transportation

Our transportation expenses are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers,
fuel expenses, and maintenance. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 our fleet of vehicles used in operations totaled 2,140 and 2,032, respectively, of which 1,429 and 1,269,
respectively, were under operating leases. The net increase in vehicles is primarily attributable to an increase of 40 vehicles in our secure shredding division that were either acquired through
acquisitions or added to support growth in the business. We reduced our operating lease expense by $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2002 as a result of our fleet leasing
program, which has benefited from an overall reduction in interest rates and our improving credit rating.

The
results of our ongoing transportation efficiency projects and the completion of our conversions to the

SafeKeeper Plus

®
system have been significant in reducing transportation expenses, including fuel and outside courier fees, as a percentage of consolidated revenues. In the year ended December 31, 2002 we had
an overall reduction in fuel consumption and a decrease in fuel expense of $0.4 million in spite of an average increase in the price per gallon of fuel during the year ended December 31,
2002. We also benefited from a $0.9 million decline in subcontracted courier expenses, which we believe is the result of better management of internal transportation resources. Our improvements
in transportation have been partially offset by increased vehicle insurance and repair costs of $0.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002
over the year ended December 31, 2001, as a result of the increased size of our fleet. We experienced a $2.0 million
increase in transportation expenses in our European operations, which is primarily attributable to the growth of operations and is also impacted by the weakening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to
the British pound sterling in the year ended December 31, 2002 versus the year ended December 31, 2001.

Product Cost of Sales and Other Cost of Sales

Product and other cost of sales are highly correlated to complementary revenue streams. Product cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 was
consistent with the year ended December 31, 2001 as a percentage of product revenues. The decrease in other cost of sales of $2.4 million is directly attributable to decreases in
variable expenses from our changing mix of complementary services and will vary as our mix of special projects changes from period to period.

General and Administrative

The dollar increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in professional fees, office facilities, telephone, and
supplies expenses. However, these costs were consistent with the increasing scale of our business, as indicated by the decrease of 1.2% as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Increased overhead
leverage offset an increase in wages due to normal inflation and merit increases.

Sales, Marketing & Account Management

The majority of our sales, marketing and account management expenses are labor related and are primarily driven by the headcount in each of these departments.
Throughout the year ended
December 31, 2002, we continued to expand our sales force and account management teams. We added approximately 60 new sales and marketing employees since December 31, 2001, a 15%
increase in headcount.

Information Technology

Information technology expenses increased $5.1 million, or 10.0%, to $56.0 million (4.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2002 principally due to increased compensation costs as a result of increased headcount and normal inflation and merit increases, as well as, a decrease in capitalizable projects.
Additionally, these costs were offset by savings of $1.7 million realized through improved management of information technology telecommunication expenses and a reduction of $1.1 million
of information technology equipment lease expenses.

Bad Debt Expense

Consolidated bad debt expense increased $1.3 million, or 12.2%, to $11.6 million (0.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2002. Our projects to centralize collection efforts within our divisions have contributed significantly to holding bad debt expense flat as a percentage of consolidated revenues.

Depreciation, Amortization, Merger-Related Expenses and Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense decreased $44.3 million, or 28.9%, to $109.0 million (8.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year
ended December 31, 2002 from $153.3 million (12.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001. Depreciation


expense
increased $16.7 million, primarily due to the additional depreciation expense related to capital expenditures, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold
improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings, and depreciation associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Depreciation associated with our digital initiatives
increased $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2002 as a result of software and hardware assets placed in service during late 2001 and throughout the years ended December 31,
2002. In the year ended December 31, 2002, the recharacterization of eight properties added in the year ended December 31, 2001 under one of our synthetic lease programs, as well as nine properties
added to such program in the year ended December 31, 2002, resulted in $1.7 million of additional depreciation. Amortization expense decreased $61.3 million, primarily due to eliminating
amortization expense related to goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142. See Note 2(g) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and "—Critical Accounting
Policies—Accounting for Acquisitions."

Merger-related
expenses are certain expenses directly related to our merger with Pierce Leahy that cannot be capitalized and include system conversion costs, costs of exiting certain
facilities, severance, relocation and pay-to-stay payments and other transaction-related costs. Merger-related expenses were $0.8 million (0.1% of consolidated revenues)
for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $3.7 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues) for the same period of 2001. All merger related activities associated with the Pierce Leahy
merger were completed in the year ended December 31, 2002.

Consolidated
loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net for the year ended December 31, 2002 consisted of disposals and asset write-downs partially offset by
a gain of $2.1 million recorded on the sale of a property in the U.K. during the second quarter of 2002.

Operating Income

As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $108.5 million, or 75.3%, to $252.6 million (19.2% of consolidated
revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $144.1 million (12.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001.

OIBDA

As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated OIBDA increased $64.2 million, or 21.6%, to $361.6 million (27.4% of consolidated revenues) for
the year ended December 31, 2002 from $297.4 million (25.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Interest Expense, Net

Consolidated interest expense, net increased $1.9 million, or 1.4%, to $136.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from
$134.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase was primarily attributable to $6.2 million of interest expense associated with 17 properties within one of our
Variable Interest Entities and increased long-term borrowings through our 2001 bond offerings. These increases were offset by a decline in our overall weighted average interest rate
resulting from a general decline in interest rates coupled with our refinancing efforts.

Foreign
currency gains of $5.0 million based on period-end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2002 primarily due to the strengthening
of the Canadian dollar and British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with our Canadian and European subsidiaries. During the year ended
December 31, 2001, the Canadian dollar had weakened compared to the U.S. dollar and was the primary reason for the foreign currency loss of $10.4 million, based on period-end
exchange rates.

The
loss on investments is the result of a $6.9 million impairment charge taken on our investment in convertible preferred stock of a technology development company in the third
quarter of 2001. In the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded $0.9 million of similar write-downs.

During
the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $1.2 million related to the early retirement of debt in conjunction with the
refinancing of our revolving credit facility and in the fourth quarter of 2002 we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $4.2 related to the early retirement of a portion of our 9


/


%
notes in conjunction with our underwritten public offering of the 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (the "7


/


% notes"). For the year ended December 31,
2001, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $20.0 million related to the early retirement of the 11


/


% senior subordinated notes and 10


/


% senior
subordinated notes in conjunction with our underwritten public offerings of the 8


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 (the "8


/


% notes"). The charges consisted
primarily of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and call and tender premiums associated with the extinguished debt.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $17.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001. The effective rate was 41.3% for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the primary reconciling item between the statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate is state
income taxes (net of federal benefit). The effective rate was (63.6%) for the year ended December 31, 2001. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we amortized non-deductible
goodwill for book purposes, however, as result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 in 2002, goodwill amortization ceased, thereby reducing the effective rate and some of the volatility with respect
to our effective rate in the future. Additionally, the 2001 effective rate was impacted by state income taxes (net of federal benefit).

Minority Interest, Discontinued Operations, and Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

Minority interest in earnings (losses) of subsidiaries, net resulted in a charge to income of $3.6 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year
ended December 31, 2002. This represents our minority partners' share of earnings (losses) in our majority-owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results. In
the year ended December 31, 2001, our subsidiaries incurred losses and the minority interest resulted in a credit to income of $1.9 million. The improved results are primarily a result of
(1) the elimination of goodwill amortization expense in accordance with


SFAS
No. 142, (2) increased profitability in our European business and (3) our European minority partners' share ($0.7 million, net of tax) of the $2.1 million gain
recorded on the sale of a property held by one of our European subsidiaries during the second quarter of 2002.

In
the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $1.1 million (net of tax of $0.8 million) as a result of resolving several outstanding
contingencies remaining from the sale of the Arcus Staffing Resources, Inc. business unit in 1999.

In
the first quarter of 2002, we recorded a non-cash charge for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $6.4 million (net of minority interest of
$8.5 million) as a result of our implementation of SFAS No. 142. There was no such charge in 2001.

Net Income (Loss)

As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated net income increased $102.3 million, or 232.3%, to $58.3 (4.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year
ended December 31, 2002 from a net loss of $44.1 (3.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Business Records Management

Revenue in our business records management segment increased 9.7% primarily due to increased storage revenues, strong special projects revenues and acquisitions.
The increase in Contribution, which we use as our internal measurement of financial performance and as the basis for allocating resources to our segments, as a percent of segment revenue for our
business records management segment is primarily due to labor and transportation efficiencies gained by the increasing scale of our business and the completion of our integration of Pierce Leahy.
Lower facilities expenditures, including rent expense and utilities, and lower bad debt expense resulting from our improved collection efforts also contributed to the improvement of Contribution, as a
percentage of segment revenue. This increase was partially offset by higher insurance premiums for property and casualty insurance and an increased investment in our sales force. Reductions in
spending related to telecommunication expenditures, as a percentage of segment revenue, also contributed to increasing Contribution.

Off-Site Data Protection

Revenue in our off-site data protection segment increased 14.2% primarily due to internal revenue growth from both existing and new customers.
Contribution as a percent of segment revenue for our off-site data protection segment increased primarily due to improved labor and transportation management. This increase was partially
offset by higher insurance premiums for property and casualty insurance and an increase in bad debt expense.

International

Revenue in our international segment increased primarily due to increased sales efforts and a large service project in the U.K., as well as, acquisitions
completed in Europe and South America in the fourth quarter of 2002. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue for our international segment increased primarily due to improved gross margins from
our European operations and reduced bad debt expense. This increase was partially offset by higher insurance premiums for property and casualty
insurance and reduced margins in our South American operations due to the deteriorating local economic conditions and devaluation of the currency in Argentina. Unfavorable currency fluctuations in
South America and Mexico during the year ended December 31, 2002 reduced revenues, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $5.0 million. This reduction was offset by the impact of favorable
currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2002 in Europe that increased revenue $2.9 million when compared to the prior year rates.

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $288.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $254.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2002. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in operating income and non-cash items, such as depreciation, amortization, debt extinguishment expenses and deferred income taxes.
The net change in assets and liabilities primarily associated with growth in revenues and the resulting increase in receivables and disbursements to


vendors
contributed $2.0 million to cash flows from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $27.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2002.

We
have made significant capital expenditures, additions to customer relationship costs and other investments, primarily acquisitions. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to
growth and include investments in storage systems, information systems and discretionary investments in real estate. Cash paid for our capital expenditures and additions to customer relationship and
acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2003 amounted to $204.5 million and $12.6 million, respectively. These investments have been funded entirely through cash
flows from operations, as was the case in the year ended December 31, 2002, and we expect this to be the case again in the year ended December 31, 2004. In addition, we received proceeds from sales of
property and equipment of $11.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. Excluding any potential acquisitions, we expect our capital expenditures to be between approximately
$210 million and approximately $240 million in the year ending December 31, 2004.

In
the year ended December 31, 2003, we paid net cash consideration of $381.2 million for acquisitions and other investments including $333.0 million for the acquisition of
Hays IMS. Cash flows from operations funded all but the Hays IMS acquisition, which was funded through borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and the net proceeds from other financing
transactions. In the year ended December 31, 2002, cash flows from operations funded all of our acquisitions.

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $315.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. During the year we had gross borrowings under our revolving credit
facilities of $744.0 million and we received net proceeds of $617.2 million from the issuance of our 7


/


% notes and our 6


/


% notes. We used the proceeds
from these financing transactions to repay debt and term loans ($698.8 million), retire senior subordinated notes ($374.3 million) and to partially fund the acquisition of Hays IMS.

Since
December 31, 2003, we have completed three acquisitions for total consideration of approximately $26 million. In addition, we acquired the remaining 49.9% equity
interest in IME for approximately $154 million. These transactions will be reflected in our consolidated statement of cash flows in the first quarter of 2004.

We
are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2003 was comprised of the following (in
thousands):

These
debt instruments are collectively referred to as the "Parent Notes." The Parent notes, along with our revolving credit facility and term loan, are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed, on a


senior
subordinated basis, by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The
remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Parent notes or the revolving credit facility and term loan.

Our
indentures use OIBDA-based calculations as primary measures of financial performance, including leverage ratios. Our key bond leverage ratio, as calculated per our bond indentures,
increased to 5.0 as of December 31, 2003 from 4.8 as of December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily attributable to indebtedness incurred by us and lent to IME to fund IME's
acquisition of the European operations of Hays IMS. Noncompliance with this leverage ratio would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. Subsequent to
December 31, 2003, our key bond leverage ratio decreased to 4.9. The decrease was the result of the partial repayment by IME of the financing we provided to acquire Hays IMS offset by our
January 2004 offering of 150 million British pounds sterling in aggregate principal amount of our 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 (the
"7


/


% notes") and the related use of the proceeds to acquire Mentmore's 49.9% equity interest in IME and to repay existing debts. Our target for this ratio is generally in the
range of 4.5 to 5.5 while the maximum ratio allowable under the bond indentures is 6.5.

Our
ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic,
financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that
future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness, or to make necessary capital expenditures.

Our
indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants including covenants that restrict our ability to complete
acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our
debt rating would not trigger a default under our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2003, we were in compliance with all material debt covenants and
agreements.

As
of December 31, 2003, we had $142.3 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, all of which was denominated in British pounds sterling in the
amount of GBP 80.0 million. We also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $34.4 million. The remaining availability under the revolving credit facility on
December 31, 2003 was $223.3 million based on our current level of external debt and the leverage ratio under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The interest rate in effect was
5.6% as of December 31, 2003.

In
January 2003, we redeemed the remaining $23.2 million of outstanding principal amount of our 9


/


% notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage
of principal amount) of 104.563%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with proceeds from our underwritten public offering of $100.0 million in aggregate principal of our 7


/


%
notes. We recorded a charge to other (income) expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations of $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2003 related to the early retirement
of the remaining 9


/


% notes.

In
March 2003, we completed two debt exchanges, which resulted in the issuance of $31.3 million in face value of our 7


/


% notes and the retirement of
$30.0 million of our 8


/


% notes. These non-cash debt exchanges resulted in carryover basis and, therefore, no gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt in accordance
with EITF No. 96-19, "Debtor's Accounting for Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments." These exchanges result in a lower interest rate and, therefore, lower interest expense
in future periods, as well as extend the maturity of our debt obligations. From time to time, we may enter into similar exchange transactions that we deem appropriate.


In
April 2003, we completed an underwritten public offering of an additional $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7


/


% notes, which were issued
at a price to investors of 104% of par, implying an effective yield to worst of 7.066%. Our net proceeds of $307.3 million, after paying the underwriters' discounts, commissions and transaction
fees, were used to fund our offer to purchase and consent solicitation relating to our outstanding 8


/


% notes, redeem the 8


/


% notes not purchased in the offer, repay
borrowings under our revolving credit facility, repay other indebtedness and pay for acquisitions.

In
April 2003, we received and accepted tenders for $143.3 million of the $220 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 8


/


% notes. In
May 2003, we redeemed the remaining $76.7 million of outstanding principal amount of our 8


/


% notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount)
of 104.375%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge to other (income) expense, net of $13.8 million in the second quarter of 2003 related to the early retirement of the


/


% notes, which consists of redemption premiums and transaction costs, as well as original issue discount and unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 8


/


%
notes.

In
June 2003, we completed an underwritten public offering of $150 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6


/


% notes. The 6


/


% notes
were issued at a price to investors of 100% of par. Our net proceeds of $147.5 million, after paying the underwriters' discounts, commissions and transaction fees, were used to redeem
$50 million in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Subsidiary notes in the third quarter of 2003 and pay for acquisitions.

In
July 2003, using proceeds from our June 2003 offering of 6


/


% notes, we redeemed $50 million of outstanding principal amount of the Subsidiary
notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 104.063%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge to other (income) expense, net of $5.5 million
in the third quarter of 2003 related to the early retirement of these Subsidiary notes, which consists of redemption premiums and transaction costs, as well as original issue discount related to these
Subsidiary notes.

In
July 2003, we and IME completed the acquisition of Hays IMS in two simultaneous transactions. IME acquired the European operations of Hays IMS for aggregate cash consideration
(including transaction costs) of approximately 190.0 million British pounds sterling ($309.0 million), while we acquired the U.S. operations of Hays IMS for aggregate cash consideration
(including transaction costs) of 14.5 million British pounds sterling ($24.0 million). Both transactions were on a cash and debt free basis.

We
provided the initial financing totaling 190.5 million British pounds sterling to IME for all of the consideration associated with the acquisition of the European operations of
Hays IMS using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We recorded a foreign currency gain of $27.8 million in other (income) expense, net for this intercompany balance
for the year ended December 31, 2003. In order to minimize the foreign currency risk associated with providing IME with the consideration necessary for the acquisition of the European
operations of Hay IMS, we borrowed 80.0 million British pounds sterling under our revolving credit facility to create a natural hedge. We recorded a foreign currency loss of
$11.5 million on the translation of this revolving credit balance to U.S. dollars in other (income) expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2003. Additionally, on July 16,
2003 we entered into two cross currency swaps with a combined notional value of 100.0 million British pounds sterling. These swaps each have a term of one year and at maturity we have a right
to receive $162.8 million in exchange for 100.0 million British pounds sterling. We have not designated these swaps as hedges and, therefore, all mark to market fluctuations of the swaps
are recorded in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of operations. We have recorded, as of December 31, 2003, a foreign currency loss of $19.0 million in other
(income) expense, net.

In
December 2003, we completed an underwritten public offering of an additional $170 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6


/


% notes, which were
issued at a price to investors of 96.5% of


par,
implying an effective yield to worst of 7.06%. Our net proceeds of $161.3 million, after paying the underwriters' discounts, commissions and transaction fees, were used to redeem
$65.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Subsidiary notes in the fourth quarter of 2003, repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility, repay other indebtedness and
pay for acquisitions.

In
December 2003, using proceeds from our December 2003 offering of 6


/


% notes, we redeemed $65.0 million of outstanding principal amount of the
Subsidiary notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 104.313%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge to other (income) expense, net of
$7.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 related to the early
retirement of these Subsidiary notes, which consists of redemption premiums and transaction costs, as well as original issue discount related to these Subsidiary notes.

In
January 2004, we completed an offering of 150 million British pounds sterling in aggregate principal amount of our 7


/


% notes, which were issued at a
price of 100.0% of par. Our net proceeds of 146.9 million British pounds sterling, after paying the initial purchasers' discounts, commissions and transaction fees, were used to fund our
acquisition of Mentmore plc's 49.9% equity interest in IME for total consideration of 82.5 million British pounds sterling, to redeem $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Subsidiary notes in the first quarter of 2004, repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility, repay other indebtedness and pay for other acquisitions.

In
February 2004, using proceeds from our January 2004 offering of 7


/


% notes, we redeemed the remaining $20 million of outstanding principal amount
of the Subsidiary notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 104.063%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We will record a charge of approximately $2 million
to other (income) expense, net in the first quarter of 2004 related to the early retirement of these remaining Subsidiary notes, which consists of redemption premiums and transaction costs, as well as
original issue discount related to these Subsidiary notes.

In
February 2004, we completed the acquisition of Mentmore plc's 49.9% equity interest in IME for total consideration of 82.5 million British pounds sterling ($154 million)
in cash from proceeds of our 7


/


% notes issued in January 2004. Included in this amount is the repayment of all trade and working capital funding owed to Mentmore by IME.
Completion of the transaction gives us 100% ownership of IME, affording us full access to all future cash flows and greater strategic and financial flexibility. This transaction should have no impact
on revenue or operating income since we already fully consolidate IME's financial results. Since we will be using the purchase method of accounting for this acquisition, 49.9% of the net assets of IME
will be adjusted to reflect their fair market value if different from their current carrying value. As a result, we expect this transaction will increase depreciation and amortization expenses going
forward. Additionally, we will record an increase in interest expense, net associated with the 7


/


% notes used to fund this acquisition and will no longer record the minority interest
in earnings of subsidiaries, net related to Mentmore's ownership interest in IME.

In
March 2004, IME and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the "IME Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of European lenders. The IME Credit Agreement
provides for maximum borrowing availability in the principal amount of 210 million British pounds sterling, including a 100 million British pounds sterling revolving credit facility,

(

which
includes the ability to borrow in certain other foreign currencies

)

, a 100 million British
pounds sterling term loan, and a 10 million British pounds sterling overdraft protection line. The revolving credit facility matures on March 2, 2009. The term loan facility is payable
in three installments; two installments of 20 million British pounds sterling on March 2, 2007 and 2008, respectively, and the final payment of the remaining balance on March 2,
2009. The interest rate on borrowings under the IME Credit Agreement is based on LIBOR and varies depending on IME's choice of interest rate period, plus an applicable margin. The IME Credit Agreement
includes various financial covenants applicable to the results of IME, which may restrict IME's ability to incur indebtedness under the IME Credit


Agreement
and with third parties. Each of IME's subsidiaries will either guarantee the obligations or pledge shares to secure the IME Credit Agreement. We have not guaranteed or otherwise provided
security for the IME Credit Agreement nor have any of our U.S., Canadian, Mexican and South American subsidiaries.

In
March 2004, IME borrowed approximately 147 million British pounds sterling under the IME Credit Agreement, including the full amount of the term loan. IME used those
proceeds to repay us 135 million British pounds sterling related to our initial financing of the acquisition of the European operations of Hays IMS. We expect to use those proceeds to:
(1) pay down approximately $104 million of real estate term loans, (2) settle all obligations associated with terminating our two cross currency swaps used to hedge the foreign
currency impact of our intercompany financing with IME, and (3) to pay down amounts outstanding under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. After the initial balance, IME's availability
under the IME Credit Agreement, based on its current level of external debt and the leverage ratio under the IME Credit Agreement, was approximately 9 million British pounds sterling.

The
real estate term loans held by our Variable Interest Entities have always been and continue to be treated as indebtedness for purposes of our financial covenants under our Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement. As of the date they were consolidated into our financial statements, they were also considered indebtedness under our Indentures for our Senior Subordinated Notes and
our Subsidiary notes. As of December 31, 2002 and 2003, these real estate term loans amounted to $202.6 million. No further financing is currently available to our Variable Interest
Entities to fund further property acquisitions. See Notes 3, 4 and 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and "—Critical Accounting Policies." The details of each real estate term
loan is a follows:

•

A
$47.5 million real estate term loan made in October 1998 bearing interest at various variable interest rates based on LIBOR (London Inter-Bank
Offered Rate) plus an applicable margin. This real estate term note has a principal payment due on March 31, 2004 of $28.8 million with the remaining $18.7 million maturing on
March 31, 2005. This real estate term loan is expected to be repaid in March 2004.

•

A
$56.4 million real estate term loan made in July 1999 bearing interest at various variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. This real
estate term note matures on December 31, 2005. This real estate term loan is expected to be repaid in March 2004.

•

A
$98.7 million real estate term loan made in May 2001 bearing interest at various variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. This real
estate term note matures on November 22, 2007.

The

In
connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn-out obligations that would be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain operational
objectives. These payments are


based
on the future results of these operations and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn-out payments we would be required to make under all such agreements as of
December 31, 2003 is approximately $5 million.

We
expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, borrowings under
our revolving credit facility and other financings, which may include secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. See Notes 5, 10 and 13 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net Operating Loss Carryforwards

At December 31, 2003, we had estimated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $123 million for federal income tax purposes. As a result
of such loss carryforwards, cash paid for income taxes has historically been substantially lower than the provision for income taxes. These net operating loss carryforwards do not include
approximately $103 million of potential preacquisition net operating loss carryforwards of Arcus Group, Inc. and certain foreign acquisitions. Any tax benefit realized related to
preacquisition net operating loss carryforwards will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill when, and if, realized. The Arcus Group carryforwards begin to expire in two years. As a result of these
loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay any significant international, U.S. federal and state income taxes in 2004.

Seasonality

Historically, our businesses have not been subject to seasonality in any material respect.

Inflation

Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary
pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long-term real estate leases,
we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Interest Rate Risk

In December 2000, January 2001 and May 2001, we and our Variable Interest Entities, which we now consolidate, entered into a total of four
derivative financial contracts, which are variable-for-fixed interest rate swaps consisting of (a) two contracts for interest payments payable on our term loan of an
aggregate principal amount of $195.5 million, (b) one contract for interest payments payable (previously certain variable operating lease commitments payable) on our real estate term
loans of an aggregate principal amount of $47.5 million and (c) one contract for interest payments payable on our real estate term loans of an aggregate principal amount of
$97.0 million. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Critical Accounting Policies" in this Form 10-K.

After
consideration of the swap contracts mentioned above, as of December 31, 2003, we had $308.1 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable
interest rate of 4.72%, and $1,781.8 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2003, 85% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. If the weighted average variable
interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 would have been reduced by $1.7 million. See Note 5 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our


long-term
indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2003 included in this Form 10-K.

Currency Risk

Our investments in IME, Iron Mountain Canada Corporation, Iron Mountain South America, Ltd. and other international investments may be subject to risks and
uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, our international revenues are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we
operate, primarily the Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. The currencies of many Latin American countries have experienced substantial volatility and depreciation in the past, including the
Argentine peso. In addition, one of our Canadian subsidiaries, Iron Mountain Canada Corporation, has U.S. dollar denominated debt. Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid
relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. We also have several intercompany obligations between
our foreign subsidiaries and Iron Mountain and our U.S.-based subsidiaries. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. Our currency
exposures to intercompany borrowings are generally unhedged, except as discussed below.

We
provided the initial financing to IME for all of the consideration associated with the acquisition of the European operations of Hays IMS using cash on hand and borrowings under our
revolving credit facility. In order to minimize the foreign currency risk associated with providing IME with the consideration necessary for the acquisition of Hay IMS, we borrowed 80.0 million
British pounds sterling under our revolving credit facility to create a natural hedge. Additionally, on July 16, 2003 we entered into two cross currency swaps with a combined notional value of
100.0 million British pounds sterling. These swaps each have a term of one year and at maturity we have a right to receive $162.8 million in exchange for 100.0 million British
pounds sterling. We have not designated these swaps as hedges and, therefore, all mark to market fluctuations of the swaps are recorded in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of
operations.

The
impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses.
Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect
of a change in foreign
exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items" component of shareholders' equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end
2003 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a $14.5 million reduction in our shareholders' equity.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The information required by this item is included in Item 15 (a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

On June 19, 2002, our Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Audit Committee and approval of the Executive Committee, dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP
as our independent public accountants and engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002.

The
audit reports of Arthur Andersen on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of
opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.


During
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 and the subsequent interim period through June 19, 2002, there were no disagreements with Arthur Andersen on any matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Arthur Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused Arthur
Andersen to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports. None of the reportable events described under Item 304(a)(1)(v) of
Regulation S-K occurred within the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 or within the interim period through June 19, 2002.

We
provided Arthur Andersen with a copy of the above disclosures. A letter dated June 19, 2002 from Arthur Andersen stating its agreement with our statements was listed under Item
7 and filed as
Exhibit 16.1 and incorporated by reference into our report on Form 8-K filed June 19, 2002.

During
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 and the subsequent interim period through June 19, 2002, we did not consult with Deloitte & Touche with respect to the
application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our consolidated financial statements or regarding
any other matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The term "disclosure controls and procedures" is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Exchange Act"). These rules refer to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods. As of December 31, 2003 (the "Evaluation Date"), we carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, such disclosure controls and
procedures were effective in ensuring that required information will be disclosed on a timely basis in our reports filed under the Exchange Act.

Changes in Internal Controls

We maintain a system of internal accounting controls that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are properly recorded and reported
and that our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use. As part of the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, we evaluated our internal controls. There were no changes
to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2003 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over
financial reporting, including any corrective actions taken with regard to any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Iron Mountain Incorporated:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Iron Mountain Incorporated (a Pennsylvania corporation) and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31,
2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of Iron Mountain
Europe Limited (a consolidated subsidiary) as of October 31, 2003 and 2002, which statements reflect total assets constituting 18% and 8%, respectively, of consolidated total assets as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and total revenues constituting 12% and 7%, respectively, of the consolidated total revenues for the years then ended. Those statements were audited by other
auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Iron Mountain Europe Limited, is based solely on the report of such other auditors.
The financial statements of Iron Mountain Incorporated and its subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2001 were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. Those auditors
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and referred to the report of other auditors in their report dated February 22, 2002 (except with respect to Note 17, as to
which the date is March 15, 2002).

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Iron
Mountain Incorporated and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


As
discussed above, the consolidated financial statements of Iron Mountain Incorporated and its subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2001 were audited by other auditors
who have ceased operations. As described in Note 2g, these consolidated financial statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (Statement) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which was adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2002. Our audit procedures with respect to the
disclosures in Note 2g for 2001 amounts included (a) agreeing the previously reported net income to the previously issued consolidated financial statements and the adjustments to
reported net income representing amortization expense (including any related tax effects) recognized in those periods related to goodwill, intangible assets that are no longer being amortized and
changes in amortization periods for intangible assets that will continue to be amortized as a result of initially applying Statement No. 142 (including any related tax effects) to the Company's
underlying records obtained from management, and (b) testing the mathematical accuracy of the reconciliation of adjusted net income to reported net income, and the related
earnings-per-share amounts. In our opinion, the disclosures for 2001 in Note 2g are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures
to the 2001 consolidated financial statements of the Company other than with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

This is a copy of the audit report previously issued by Arthur Andersen LLP in connection with Iron Mountain Incorporated's filing of an Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2001. This audit report has not been reissued by Arthur Andersen LLP in connection with this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2003. See Exhibit 23.3 to the December 31, 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for further discussion. The consolidated balance
sheets as of December 31, 2000 and 2001 and the consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and comprehensive loss and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1999
and 2000 referred to in this report have not been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To
the Board of Directors of

Iron Mountain Incorporated:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Iron Mountain Incorporated (a Pennsylvania corporation) and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and comprehensive loss and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial
statements are the responsibility of Iron Mountain Incorporated's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the
consolidated financial statements of Iron Mountain Europe Limited as of October 31, 2000 and 2001, which statements reflect total assets and total revenues of 6 percent and
5 percent in 2000, and 8 percent and 6 percent in 2001, respectively, of the related consolidated totals. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been
furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for this entity, is based solely on the report of the other auditors.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Iron
Mountain Incorporated and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2003

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

1. Nature of Business

The accompanying financial statements represent the consolidated accounts of Iron Mountain Incorporated, a Pennsylvania corporation, and its subsidiaries. We are
an international full-service provider of records and information management and related services for all media in various locations throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, Mexico
and South America to Fortune 500 and FTSE 100 companies, and numerous legal, banking, health care, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

a.     Principles
of Consolidation

The
accompanying financial statements reflect our financial position and results of operations on a consolidated basis. All significant intercompany account balances have been
eliminated.

b.     Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates, judgments and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for
the period then ended. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the estimates used, including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, impairments of tangible and intangible assets,
income taxes, purchase accounting related reserves, self-insurance liabilities, incentive compensation liabilities, litigation liabilities and contingencies. We base our estimates on
historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. We use these estimates to assist us in the identification and assessment of the
accounting treatment necessary with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

c.     Cash
and Cash Equivalents

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on hand and cash invested in short-term securities which have remaining maturities at the date of purchase of less than 90 days.
Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Our balance of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2003 includes $1,959 of restricted cash due to
contractual and other arrangements.

d.     Foreign
Currency Translation

Local
currencies are considered the functional currencies for most of our operations outside the United States. All assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange
rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 52, "Foreign Currency
Translation." Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders' equity. The gain or loss on foreign currency transactions,
including those related to U.S. dollar denominated 8


/


% senior notes of our Canadian subsidiary and those related to the foreign currency


denominated
intercompany obligations of our foreign subsidiaries to us, are included in Other (Income) Expense, net, on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The total of such net (gains) losses
amounted to $10,437, $(5,043) and $(30,223) for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.

e.     Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

SFAS
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" requires that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a
liability measured at its fair value. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in the recognition of a derivative liability and a corresponding transition adjustment charge to accumulated other
comprehensive items of approximately $214 as of January 1, 2001.

Periodically,
we acquire derivative instruments that are intended to hedge either cash flows or fair values which are subject to exchange or other market price risk, and not for trading
purposes. We have formally documented our hedging relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for
undertaking each hedge transaction.

f.      Property,
Plant and Equipment

Property,
plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method with the following useful lives:

Buildings

40 to 50 years

Leasehold improvements

8 to 10 years or the life of the lease, whichever is shorter

Racking

5 to 20 years

Warehouse equipment/vehicles

3 to 20 years

Furniture and fixtures

3 to 10 years

Computer hardware and software

3 to 5 years

Property,
plant and equipment, at cost, consist of the following:

Minor
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Major improvements which extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or the efficiency of property
owned are capitalized. Major improvements to leased buildings are capitalized as leasehold improvements and depreciated.

We
develop various software applications for internal use. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal
use computer software projects (to the extent of the time spent directly on the project) are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the
design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in
service.

We
apply the provisions of Statement of Position 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use" ("SOP 98-1") which
requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. SOP 98-1 also defines which types of costs
should be capitalized and which should be expensed. The computer software costs incurred and capitalized are being depreciated over their useful lives or the useful lives of the related assets, and
are evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."

During
the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, we replaced certain of our internal use software programs, which resulted in the write-off to loss on
disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of the remaining net book value of $1,077 and $710, respectively.

g.     Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

Effective
July 1, 2001 and January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets," respectively. SFAS No. 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method. Under SFAS No. 142,
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.
Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. Had SFAS No. 142 been effective January 1, 2001, goodwill
amortization expense would have been reduced by $59,217 ($50,903, net of tax) for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Through
December 31, 2001, we reviewed our existing goodwill for impairment, consistent with the guidelines of SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of" and determined that no amounts of goodwill were impaired using the undiscounted future cash flow methodology of
SFAS No. 121. Effective January 1, 2002, we reviewed goodwill for impairment consistent with the guidelines of SFAS No. 142 using a discounted future cash flow approach to
approximate fair value. The result of testing our goodwill for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, as of January 1, 2002, was a non-cash charge of $6,396 (net of
minority interest of $8,487), which, consistent with SFAS No. 142, is reported in the caption "cumulative effect of change in accounting principle" in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations. Impairment adjustments recognized in the future, if any, are generally required to be recognized as


operating
expenses. The $6,396 charge relates to our South American reporting unit within our international reporting segment. The South American reporting unit failed the impairment test primarily
due to a reduction in the expected future performance of the unit resulting from a deterioration of the local economic environment and the devaluation of the currency in Argentina. As goodwill
amortization expense in our South American reporting unit is not deductible for tax purposes, this impairment charge is not net of a tax benefit. We have a controlling 50.1% interest in Iron Mountain
South America, Ltd ("IMSA") and the remainder is owned by an unaffiliated entity. IMSA has acquired a controlling interest in entities in which local partners have retained a minority interest
in order to enhance our local market expertise. These local partners have no ownership interest in IMSA. This has caused the minority interest portion of the non-cash goodwill impairment
charge ($8,487) to exceed our portion of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge ($6,396). In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we selected October 1 as our annual goodwill
impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2003 and noted no impairment of goodwill at our reporting units as of that date. As of
December 31, 2003, no factors were identified that would alter this assessment.

The
changes in the carrying value of goodwill attributable to each reportable operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003 is as follows:

h.     Long-Lived
Assets

In
accordance with SFAS No. 144, we review long-lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets (excluding goodwill) for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation
to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to
be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long-lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value
is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets.

i.      Customer
Relationships and Acquisition Costs and Other

In
connection with adopting SFAS No. 142, we reassessed the useful lives and classification of our intangible assets. Costs related to the acquisition of large volume accounts,
net of revenues received for the initial transfer of the records, are capitalized and amortized for periods ranging from five to 30 years (weighted average of 29 years at
December 31, 2003). These costs had previously been amortized over periods not to exceed 12 years. If the customer terminates its relationship with us, the unamortized cost is charged to
expense. However, in the event of such termination, we collect, and record as income, permanent removal fees that generally equal or exceed the amount of the unamortized costs. Customer relationship
intangible assets acquired through business combinations are amortized over periods ranging from five to 30 years (weighted average of 21 years at December 31, 2003). As of
December 31, 2002 and 2003, the gross carrying amount of customer relationships and acquisition costs was $58,781 and $131,294, respectively, and accumulated amortization of those costs was
$10,568 and $14,828, respectively. For years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, amortization expense was $3,053, $1,770, and $4,395, respectively.

Other
intangible assets, including noncompetition agreements and trademarks, are capitalized and amortized over a weighted average period of five years. As of December 31, 2002
and 2003, the gross carrying amount of other intangible assets was $21,088 and $22,212, respectively, and accumulated amortization of those costs was $16,857 and $20,280, respectively. For the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, amortization expense was $3,872, $3,046 and $2,559, respectively.


j.      Deferred
Financing Costs

Deferred
financing costs are amortized over the life of the related debt using the effective interest rate method. If debt is retired early, the related unamortized deferred financing
costs are written off in the
period the debt is retired to other (income) expense, net. As of December 31, 2002 and 2003, gross carrying amount of deferred financing costs was $25,883 and $29,620, respectively, and
accumulated amortization of those costs was $6,525 and $5,686, respectively, and was recorded in interest expense, net.

k.     Investment
in Preferred Stock

In
May 2000, we made a $6,500 investment in the convertible preferred stock of LiveVault Corporation, a technology development company. This investment is accounted for at the lower of
cost or market. In September 2001, we recorded an impairment charge in other (income) expense, net of $6,900, including the original investment and certain loans related to such investment. In
December 2001, in connection with a recapitalization of LiveVault, we made an additional $2,000 investment in LiveVault's convertible preferred stock. In December 2002, we recorded an
impairment charge related to this investment in other (income) expense, net of $600. In March 2003, we made an additional $1,357 investment in LiveVault's convertible preferred stock. As of
December 31, 2002 and 2003, $1,400 and $2,757, respectively, of carrying value related to this investment is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

m.    Revenues

Our
revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service and storage material sales revenues. Storage revenues consist of periodic charges related to the storage of materials (either
on a per unit or per cubic foot of records basis). In certain circumstances, based upon customer requirements, storage revenues include periodic charges associated with normal, recurring service
activities. Service and storage material sales revenues are comprised of charges for related service activities and courier


operations
and the sale of storage materials. Customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms.

Storage
and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective service is provided. Storage material sales are recognized when shipped to the customer. Amounts related to future
storage for customers where storage fees are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and amortized over the applicable period.

n.     Deferred
Rent

We
have entered into various leases for buildings used in the storage of records. Certain leases have fixed escalation clauses or other features which require normalization of the rental
expense over the life of the lease resulting in deferred rent being reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we have assumed various above market leases in connection
with certain of our acquisitions. The difference between the present value of these lease obligations and the market rate at the date of the acquisition was recorded as a net deferred rent liability
and is being amortized over the remaining lives of the respective leases.

o.     Stock-based
Compensation

As
of January 1, 2003, we adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure." As a result we began using the fair value method of accounting in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the
prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for
previous awards. Additionally, we recognize expense related to the discount embedded in our employee stock purchase plan. We will apply the fair value recognition provisions to all stock based awards
granted, modified or settled on or after January 1, 2003 and will continue to provide the required pro forma information for all awards previously granted, modified or settled before
January 1, 2003.

Had
we elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of the options granted at grant date as prescribed by SFAS No. 123 and No. 148, net (loss) income and
net (loss) income per share would have been changed to the pro forma amounts indicated in the table below:

p.     Merger-related
Expenses

Merger-related
expenses as presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relate primarily to non-capitalizable expenses directly related to our merger with
Pierce Leahy Corp. and consist primarily of severance, relocation and pay-to-stay payments, costs of exiting certain facilities, system conversion costs and other
transaction-related costs.

q.     Income
Taxes

We
account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when
recovery of deferred tax assets is not considered likely.

r.     Income
(Loss) Per Share—Basic and Diluted

In
accordance with SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share," basic net income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. The calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share is consistent with that of basic net income (loss) per share but gives effect to all potential common shares (that is,
securities such as options, warrants or convertible securities) that were outstanding during the period, unless the effect is antidilutive. Potential common shares, substantially attributable to stock
options, included in the calculation of diluted net income per share totaled 1,420,655 and 1,451,467 shares for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Potential common shares
of 1,912,069, 316,864 and 380,304
for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively, have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share, as their effects are antidilutive.

s.     Reclassifications

Certain
reclassifications have been made to the 2001 and 2002 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2003 presentation.


t.      New
Accounting Pronouncements

In
April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, amendment of FASB Statement
No. 13, and Technical Corrections," which, among other things, limits the classification of gains and losses from extinguishment of debt as extraordinary to only those transactions that are
unusual and infrequent in nature as defined by APB Opinion No. 30 "Reporting the Results of Operations—Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and
Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions." We adopted SFAS No. 145 on January 1, 2003. Gains and losses on certain future debt extinguishments, if any,
will be recorded in pre-tax income. Losses on early extinguishment of debt of $19,980, $5,430 and $28,175 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively, are
included in other (income) expense, net in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations to conform to the requirements under SFAS No. 145.

In
January and December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46") and No. 46, revised ("FIN 46R"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities."
These statements, which address perceived weaknesses in accounting for entities commonly known as special-purpose or off-balance-sheet, require consolidation of certain interests or
arrangements by virtue of holding a controlling financial interest in such entities. Certain provisions of FIN 46R related to interests in special purpose entities were applicable for the period ended
December 31, 2003. We must apply FIN 46R to our interests in all entities subject to the interpretation as of the first interim or annual period ending after March 15, 2004. Adoption of
this new method of accounting for variable interest entities did not and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.

3. Variable Interest Entities

Three variable interest entities were established to acquire properties and lease those properties to us. These leases were designed to qualify as operating
leases for accounting purposes, where the monthly lease expense was recorded as rent expense in our consolidated statements of operations and where the related underlying assets and liabilities were
not consolidated in our consolidated balance sheets. We changed the characterization and the related accounting for properties in one variable interest entity ("VIE III") during the third quarter of
2002 and prospectively for new property acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2002. In addition, anticipating the requirement to consolidate, and in line with our objective of transparent reporting,
we voluntarily guaranteed all of the at-risk equity in VIE III and our two other variable interest entities (together, the "Other Variable Interest Entities" and, collectively with VIE
III, our "Variable Interest Entities") as of December 31, 2002. These guarantees resulted in our consolidating all of our Variable Interest Entities' assets and liabilities.

Our
Variable Interest Entities were financed with real estate term loans. These real estate term loans have always been and continue to be treated as indebtedness for purposes of our
financial covenants under our Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated March 15, 2002 (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement"). As of the date they were consolidated into our
financial statements, they were also considered indebtedness under our indentures for certain of our senior subordinated notes. As of December 31, 2003, these real estate term loans amounted to
$202,647. No further financing is currently available to our Variable Interest Entities to fund further property acquisitions. See Note 5.

As
of December 31, 2002, we voluntarily guaranteed all of the at-risk equity in VIE III. This resulted in our consolidating all of its remaining assets and
liabilities. VIE III's remaining assets and liabilities relate to an interest rate swap agreement, which it entered into upon its inception. This swap agreement hedges the majority of interest rate
risk associated with VIE III's real estate term loans. Specifically, VIE III has swapped $97,000 of floating rate debt to fixed rate debt. Since the time it entered into the swap agreement, interest
rates have fallen. As a result, the estimated fair value of the derivative liability held by VIE III, and now consolidated on our balance sheet, related to the swap agreement was $13,658 and $10,960
at December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively. This swap has been


since
inception and continues to be, as of December 31, 2003, an effective hedge in accordance with SFAS No. 133. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, we recorded
depreciation expense of $1,675 and $1,779 associated with the properties, respectively, and interest expense of $6,193 and $8,169, respectively, associated with the real estate term loans. See Notes 4
and 5.

In
addition, as of December 31, 2002, we voluntarily guaranteed all of the at-risk equity in the Other Variable Interest Entities. This resulted in our consolidating
all of their assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2002, the total impact of consolidating the Other Variable Interest Entities was an increase of $103,932 both in property, plant and
equipment and
long-term debt. The underlying leases associated with the Other Variable Interest Entities were treated as operating leases from inception (as early as 1998) through consolidation on
December 31, 2002. As a result, we recorded $6,733 and $5,915 in rent expense in our consolidated statements of operations related to these leases for the years ended December 31, 2001
and 2002, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded depreciation expense of $2,001 associated with the properties, interest expense of $5,464 associated with the real
estate term loans and no longer have rent expense related to leases associated with the Other Variable Interest Entities in our consolidated financial results.

4. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We have entered into two interest rate swap agreements, which are derivatives as defined by SFAS No. 133 and designated as cash flow hedges. These swap
agreements hedge interest rate risk on certain amounts of our term loan. For all qualifying and highly effective cash flow hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in
other comprehensive income (loss) which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items included in shareholders' equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Specifically, we chose
to swap the interest rates on $195,500 of floating rate debt to fixed rate. Since entering into these two swap agreements, interest rates have fallen. As a result, the estimated cost to terminate
these swaps (fair value of derivative liability) would be $18,713 and $13,370 at December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively. We have recorded, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, the
fair value of the derivative liability, a deferred tax asset and a corresponding charge to accumulated other comprehensive items of $13,370 ($8,709 recorded in accrued expenses and $4,661 recorded in
other long-term liabilities), $4,878 and $8,492, respectively, as of December 31, 2003. Additionally, as a result of the foregoing, for the years ended December 31, 2001,
2002 and 2003, we recorded additional interest expense of $2,677, $7,534 and $8,709 resulting from interest rate swap settlements. These interest rate swap agreements were determined to be highly
effective, and therefore no ineffectiveness was recorded in earnings.

We
have entered into a third interest rate swap agreement, which was designated as a cash flow hedge through December 31, 2002. This swap agreement hedged interest rate risk on
certain amounts of our variable operating lease commitments. Specifically, we chose to swap the variable component of $47,500 of certain operating lease commitments to fixed operating lease
commitments. Since entering into the swap agreement, interest rates have fallen. As a result, the estimated cost to terminate these swaps (fair value of derivative liability) would be $2,949 and
$1,250 at December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively. We have recorded, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, the estimated cost to terminate this swap, a deferred tax asset and a
corresponding charge to accumulated other


comprehensive
items of $1,250 ($1,135 recorded in accrued expenses and $115 recorded in other long-term liabilities), $456 and $794, respectively, as of December 31, 2003. From
inception through December 31, 2002, this interest rate swap agreement was determined to be highly effective, and therefore no ineffectiveness was recorded in earnings. As a result of the
consolidation of one of the Other Variable Interest Entities ("VIE I") on December 31, 2002, we consolidated the real estate term loans of VIE I and the operating lease commitments that were
hedged by this swap are now considered to be inter-company transactions. As a result, this interest rate swap agreement was deemed to be no longer effective on a prospective basis. The unrealized mark
to market losses previously recorded in other comprehensive income attributable to this swap ($1,875, net of tax, as of December 31, 2002) will be amortized through other (income) expense, net
in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations based on the changes in the fair value of the swap each period that the remaining interest payments are made on VIE I's real estate term loans.
We will prospectively account for mark to market changes in the derivative liability of this swap through other (income) expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. This
accounting will have a net zero impact within our consolidated statement of operations as it relates to the amortization of unrealized mark to market losses and the fair valuing of the derivative
liability. Additionally, as a result of the foregoing, for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, we recorded additional rent expense of $743 and $1,807, respectively, resulting from the
settlements associated with this interest rate swap agreement and for the year ended December 31, 2003 we recorded additional interest expense of $2,083 resulting from settlements associated
with this interest rate swap agreement.

Also,
as of December 31, 2002, we consolidated VIE III which had entered into an interest rate swap agreement upon its inception which was designated as a cash flow hedge. This
swap agreement hedges the majority of interest rate risk associated with VIE III's real estate term loans. Specifically, VIE III has swapped $97,000 of floating rate debt to fixed rate debt. Since the
time it entered into the swap agreement, interest rates have fallen. As a result, the estimated cost to terminate these swaps (fair value of derivative liability) would be $13,658 and $10,960 at
December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively. We have recorded, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, the fair value of the derivative liability, a deferred tax asset and a corresponding
charge to accumulated other comprehensive items of $10,960 ($4,806 recorded in accrued expenses and $6,154 recorded in other long-term liabilities), $3,998 and $6,962, respectively, as of
December 31, 2003. Additionally, as a result of the foregoing, for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, we recorded additional interest expense of $3,423 and $4,806, respectively,
resulting from interest rate swap settlements. This interest rate swap agreement has been since inception and continues to be a highly effective hedge, and therefore no ineffectiveness was recorded in
earnings.

In
July 2003, we provided the initial financing totaling 190,459 British pounds sterling to Iron Mountain Europe Limited ("IME"), our European joint venture, for all of the
consideration associated with the acquisition of the information management services business of Hays plc ("Hays IMS") using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We
recorded a foreign currency gain of $27,777 in other (income) expense, net for this intercompany balance for the year ended December 31, 2003. In order to minimize the foreign currency risk
associated with providing IME with the consideration necessary for the acquisition of the European operations of Hay IMS, we borrowed


80,000
British pounds sterling under our revolving credit facility to create a natural hedge. We recorded a foreign currency loss of $11,496 on the translation of this revolving credit balance to U.S.
dollars in other (income) expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2003. In addition, on July 16, 2003, we entered into two cross currency swaps with a combined notional value of
100,000 British pounds sterling. These swaps each have a term of one year and at maturity we have a right to receive $162,800 in exchange for 100,000 British pounds sterling. We have not designated
these swaps as hedges and, therefore, all mark to market fluctuations of the swaps are recorded in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of operations. We have recorded, in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet, the fair value of the derivative liability and the associated swap cost of $18,978 in accrued expenses as of December 31, 2003 and for the year ended
December 31, 2003, we recorded $18,978 in other (income) expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

a.     Revolving
Credit Facility and Term Loans

The
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement replaced our prior credit agreement. As a result, we recorded a charge to other (income) expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement
of operations of $1,222 related to the early retirement of debt in conjunction with the refinancing of our revolving credit facility in the year ended December 31, 2002. The Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement has an aggregate principal amount of $650,000 and includes a $400,000 revolving credit


facility,
which includes the ability to borrow in certain foreign currencies, and a $250,000 term loan facility. The revolving credit facility matures on January 31, 2005. Quarterly term loan
payments of $250 began in the fourth quarter of 2002 and will continue through maturity on February 15, 2008, at which time the remaining outstanding principal balance of the term loan facility
is due. The interest rate on borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin. All
intercompany notes and the capital stock of all of our U.S. subsidiaries are pledged to secure the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2003, we had $142,280 of borrowings
outstanding under our revolving credit facility, all of which was denominated in British pound sterling in the amount of GBP 80,000. We also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $34,447.
The remaining availability under the revolving credit facility on December 31, 2003 was $223,273 based on our current level of external debt and the leverage ratio under the Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement. The interest rate in effect was 5.6% as of December 31, 2003.

In
December 2000, we entered into an interest rate swap contract to hedge the risk of changes in market interest rates on our Tranche B term loan. The instrument is a
variable-for-fixed swap of quarterly interest payments payable on certain amounts of the Tranche B term loan through 2006. The notional value of the swap equals $99,500 and has
a fixed rate of 5.9% and a variable rate based on periodic three-month London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR). In January 2001, we entered into a second interest rate swap contract
on the Tranche B term loan. The notional value of the second swap equals $96,000 and has a fixed rate of 5.5% and a variable rate based on periodic three-month LIBOR. In conjunction with the Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement on March 15, 2002, these interest rate swap contracts hedge the risk of changes in market interest rates on our term loan due 2008 rather than the previous Tranche
B term loan due 2006.

The
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive financial and operating covenants including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash
dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not
trigger a default under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with all material debt covenants as of December 31, 2003.

b.     Publicly
Issued Notes

As
of December 31, 2003, we have four series of senior subordinated notes issued to the public, that are obligations of the parent company, Iron Mountain Incorporated (the "Parent
notes"):

•

$150,000
principal amount of notes maturing on July 1, 2011 and bearing interest at a rate of 8


/


% per annum, payable semi-annually in
arrears on January 1 and July 1;

•

$480,874
principal amount of notes maturing on April 1, 2013 and bearing interest at a rate of 8


/


% per annum, payable semi-annually in
arrears on April 1 and October 1;

•

$431,255
principal amount of notes maturing on January 15, 2015 and bearing interest at a rate of 7


/


% per annum, payable semi-annually in
arrears on January 15 and July 15; and


•

$320,000
principal amount of notes maturing on January 1, 2016 and bearing interest at a rate of 6


/


% per annum, payable semi-annually in
arrears on January 1 and July 1.

The
Parent notes, along with our revolving credit facility and term loan, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by substantially all of our direct and
indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Parent notes or
the revolving credit facility and the term loan.

In
addition, Canada Company, our principal Canadian subsidiary, has publicly issued $135,000 principal amount of senior notes that mature on May 15, 2008 and bear interest at a rate of


/


% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15. The Subsidiary notes are general unsecured obligations of Canada Company, ranking

pari passu

in right of payment to all of Canada Company's existing and future senior indebtedness. The Subsidiary notes are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by Iron Mountain Incorporated and the Guarantors. In addition, several of the non-guarantors that are organized under the laws of Canadian
provinces fully and unconditionally guarantee the Subsidiary notes on a senior basis. As with the Parent notes, these guarantees are joint and several. In July 2003, we redeemed $50,000 of
outstanding principal amount of the Subsidiary notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage
of principal amount) of 104.063%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In December 2003, we redeemed $65,015 of outstanding principal amount of the Subsidiary notes, at a redemption price
(expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 104.313%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge to other (income) expense, net of $12,530 in 2003 related to the early retirement of
these Subsidiary notes, which consists of redemption premiums and transaction costs, as well as original issue discount related to these Subsidiary notes. In February 2004, we redeemed the
remaining $19,985 of outstanding principal amount of the Subsidiary notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 104.063%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We will
record a charge to other (income) expense, net of approximately $2,000 in the first quarter of 2004 related to the early retirement of these remaining Subsidiary notes, which consists of redemption
premiums and transaction costs as well as original issue discount related to these Subsidiary notes.

In
January 2003, we redeemed the remaining $23,183 of outstanding principal amount of our 9


/


% notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal
amount) of 104.563%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with proceeds from our underwritten public offering of $100,000 in aggregate principal of our 7

In
March 2003, we completed two debt exchanges which resulted in the issuance of $31,255 in face value of our 7

% notes. These non-cash debt exchanges resulted in carryover basis and, therefore, no gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt in accordance with EITF
No. 96-19, "Debtor's Accounting for Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments." These exchanges result in a lower interest rate and, therefore, lower interest expense in


future
periods as well as extend the maturity of our debt obligations. From time to time, we may enter into similar exchange transactions that we deem appropriate.

In
April 2003, we completed an underwritten public offering of an additional $300,000 in aggregate principal amount of our 7

In
January 2004, we completed an offering of 150,000 British pounds sterling in aggregate principal amount of our 7

amount of our outstanding Subsidiary notes in the first quarter of 2004, repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility, repay other indebtedness and pay for other acquisitions.

principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of a "Change of Control," which is defined in each respective indenture. Except for required repurchases upon the occurrence of
a Change of Control or in the event of certain asset sales, each as described in the respective indenture, we are not required to make sinking fund or redemption payments with respect to any of the
notes.


Our
indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants including covenants that restrict our ability to complete
acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our
debt rating would not trigger a default under our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2003, we were in compliance with all material debt covenants and
agreements.

c.     Real
Estate Term Loans

Our
Variable Interest Entities were financed with real estate term loans. See Note 3. As of December 31, 2003, these real estate term loans amounted to $202,647. No further
financing is currently available to our Variable Interest Entities to fund further property acquisitions. The details of each real estate term loan is a follows:

•

A
$47,500 real estate term loan made in October, 1998 bearing interest at various variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. This real estate term
note has a principal payment due on March 31, 2004 of $28,800 with the remaining $18,700 maturing on March 31, 2005. Effective February 1, 2001, we entered into an interest rate
swap to fix this floating rate debt for its full term at a fixed interest of 7.42%. This real estate term loan is expected to be repaid in March 2004.

•

A
$56,432 real estate term loan made in July, 1999 bearing interest at various variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. As of December 31,
2003, the weighted
average interest rate on this note was 3.33%. This real estate term note matures on December 31, 2005. This real estate term loan is expected to be repaid in March 2004.

•

A
$98,715 real estate term loan made in May, 2001 bearing interest at various variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. This real estate term note
matures on November 22, 2007. Effective May 21, 2001, we entered into an interest rate swap to fix $97,000 of this floating rate debt for its full term at a fixed interest of 8.41%.

The
real estate term loans held by our Variable Interest Entities have always been and continue to be treated as indebtedness for purposes of our financial covenants under our Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement. As of the date they were consolidated into our financial statements, they were also considered indebtedness under our Indentures for our Senior Subordinated Notes and
our Subsidiary notes. We were in compliance with all material debt covenants under these real estate term loans as of December 31, 2003.

d.     Real
Estate Mortgages

In
connection with the purchase of real estate and acquisitions, we assumed several mortgages on real property. The mortgages bear interest at rates ranging from 5% to 8.5% and are
payable in various installments through 2025.


e.     Seller
Notes

In
connection with the merger with Pierce Leahy in 2000, we assumed debt related to certain existing notes as a result of acquisitions which Pierce Leahy completed in 1999. The notes
bear interest at a rate of 4.75% per year. The outstanding balance of $12,607 on these notes at December 31, 2003 is due on demand through 2009 and is classified as a current portion of
long-term debt. The notes are supported by a letter of credit under our revolving credit facility.

f.      Other

Other
long-term debt includes various notes and obligations assumed by us as a result of certain acquisitions. Additionally, IME has term loans and revolving credit
facilities with its local banks that provide for approximately $87,791 of credit, of which $35,801 was available as of December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2002, the amounts outstanding
under IME's bank overdraft (due on demand), term loan and working capital/revolving credit facilities amounted to $11,175, $11,050 and $12,811, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, the
amounts outstanding under IME's term loan and revolving credit facilities amounted to $32,503 and $19,487, respectively. Principal on the term loan and revolving credit facility are due on
April 30, 2004 and interest is charged on borrowings at 1.25% over LIBOR. The average effective interest rate of IME's debt was 6.05%, 5.80% and 4.22% for the years ending 2001, 2002 and 2003,
respectively. IME's various debt and credit facilities are secured by the assets of IME and each of its subsidiaries and includes various financial and non-financial covenants and
restrictions based on net worth, net indebtedness and net finance charges. During 2003, IME breached its interest covenant following the acquisition of the European operations of Hays IMS. However,
IME obtained from the bank a waiver of the breach.

7. Acquisitions

In July 2003, we and IME completed the acquisition of Hays IMS in two simultaneous transactions. IME acquired the European operations of Hays IMS for
aggregate cash consideration (including transaction costs) of approximately 190,000 British pounds sterling ($309,000), while we acquired the U.S. operations of Hays IMS for aggregate cash
consideration (including transaction costs) of approximately 14,500 British pounds sterling ($24,000). Both transactions were on a cash and debt free basis.

We
purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of 16, 10 and 8 records management businesses during 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Each of these
acquisitions was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the results of operations for each acquisition have been included in our consolidated results from their
respective acquisition dates. Consideration for the various acquisitions included: (1) cash, which was provided through our credit facilities and (2) the issuance of certain of our
senior subordinated notes.

A
summary of the consideration paid and the allocation of the purchase price of the acquisitions is as follows:

Included
in cash paid for acquisitions in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2001 is a $5,524 contingent payment that was paid during 2001
related to acquisitions made before 2001.

(2)

Included
in cash paid for acquisitions in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2002 is a $7,165 contingent payment that was paid during 2002
related to an acquisition made in 2000.

(3)

Included
in cash paid for acquisitions in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2003 is a $1,077 contingent payment that was paid in 2003
related to an acquisition made in 2001.

Allocation
of the purchase price for the 2003 acquisitions was based on estimates of the fair value of net assets acquired, and is subject to adjustment. The purchase price allocations
of certain 2003 transactions are subject to finalization of the assessment of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We are not
aware of any information that would indicate that the final purchase price allocations will differ meaningfully from preliminary estimates.


In
connection with each of our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses. The restructuring activities include certain reductions in staffing
levels, elimination of duplicate facilities and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the acquired businesses. The estimated cost of these restructuring activities were recorded as
costs of the acquisitions and were provided in accordance with EITF No. 95-3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination." We finalize
restructuring plans for each business no later than one year from the date of acquisition. Unresolved matters at December 31, 2003 primarily include completion of planned abandonments of
facilities and severances for certain acquisitions.

The
following is a summary of reserves related to such restructuring activities:

Includes
adjustments to goodwill as a result of management finalizing its restructuring plans.

At
December 31, 2002, the restructuring reserves related to acquisitions consisted of lease losses on abandoned facilities ($5,146), severance costs for approximately two people
($578) and move and other exit costs ($4,182).

At
December 31, 2003, the restructuring reserves related to acquisitions consisted of lease losses on abandoned facilities ($6,849), severance costs for approximately 158 people
($3,593) and move and other exit costs ($5,880). These accruals are expected to be used prior to December 31, 2004 except for lease losses of $4,927 and severance contracts of $314, both of
which are based on contracts that extend beyond one year.

In
connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn-out obligations that would be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain operational
objectives. These payments are based on the future results of these operations and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn-out payments we would be required to make under all such
agreements as of December 31, 2003 is approximately $4,800.

9. Discontinued Operations

In June 1999, in order to focus on our records and information management services business, we decided to sell our information technology staffing
business, Arcus Staffing Resources, Inc., which was acquired in January 1998 as part of the acquisition of Arcus Group, Inc. Effective November 1, 1999, we completed the
sale of substantially all of the assets of Arcus Staffing. The terms of the sale included contingent payments for a period of 18 months. In accordance with the provisions of APB No. 30,
the sale of Arcus Staffing was accounted for as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, the Arcus Staffing operations were segregated from our continuing operations and reported as a separate line item
on our consolidated statement of operations.

In
1999, we recorded an estimated loss on the sale of Arcus Staffing of $13,400, comprised of a write-off of goodwill, a deferred tax benefit and estimated expenses directly
related to the transaction partially offset by the estimated income from operations of Arcus Staffing through the date of disposition. In 2002, we recorded income from discontinued operations of
$1,116 (net of tax of $768) related to the reversal of remaining liabilities associated with certain contingencies which have been resolved.

We
have estimated federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2018 through 2021 of $123,200 at December 31, 2003 to reduce future federal taxable income, if
any. These net operating loss carryforwards do not include approximately $103,000 of potential preacquisition net operating loss carryforwards of Arcus Group, Inc. and certain foreign
acquisitions. Any tax benefit realized related to preacquisition net operating loss carryforwards will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill when, and if, realized. The Arcus Group carryforwards
begin to expire in two years. We also have estimated state net operating loss carryforwards of $73,776. The state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to a valuation allowance of approximately
54%. Additionally, we have alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $1,187, which have no expiration date and are available to reduce future income taxes, if any.

We
receive a tax deduction upon exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying
common stock on the date of exercise, which is included in the net operating loss carryforwards above. During 2002 and 2003, we recognized $4,476 and $3,950 of tax benefit related to the exercise of
non-qualified stock options, which was credited to equity.

12. Segment Information

We operate in seven operating segments, based on their economic environment, geographic area, the nature of their services and the nature of their processes:

•

Business
Records Management—throughout the United States and Canada, the storage of paper documents, as well as all other non-electronic media such
as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, X-rays and blueprints, including healthcare information services, vital records services and service, courier operations,
and the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents for corporate customers

•

Off-Site
Data Protection—the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster and business recovery plans, including
service and courier operations

•

Fulfillment—the
storage of customer marketing literature and delivery to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' sites based on current and
prospective customer orders; the assembly of custom marketing packages and orders; the management and detailed reporting on customer marketing literature inventories

•

Digital
Archiving Services—storage and related services for electronic records conveyed via telecommunication lines and the Internet


•

Europe—records
and information management services and off-site data protection services throughout Europe

•

South
America—records and information management services throughout South America

•

Mexico—records
and information management services throughout Mexico

The
South America and Mexico operating segments do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for a reporting segment, but have been aggregated and reported with Europe as one
reporting segment, "International," given their similar economic characteristics, products, customers and processes. The Fulfillment and Digital Archiving Services operating segments do not meet the
quantitative thresholds for a reportable segment and thus are included in the "Corporate and Other" category. Corporate items include non-operating overhead, corporate general and
administrative expenses, non-allocated operating expenses and inter-segment eliminations. Corporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents, prepaid items, certain
non-operating fixed assets, deferred income taxes, certain non-trade receivables, certain inter-segment receivables, and deferred financing costs.

The
accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 2 except that certain costs are allocated from Corporate to the other segments in 2001,
2002 and 2003, primarily to our Business Records Management and Off-Site Data Protection segments. These allocations, which include rent, worker's compensation, property, general
liability, auto and other insurance, pension/medical costs, sick and vacation costs, incentive compensation, real estate property taxes and provision for bad debts, are based on rates set at the
beginning of each year. Contribution for each segment is defined as total revenues less cost of sales (excluding depreciation) and selling,


general
and administrative expenses including the costs allocated to each segment as described above. Internally, we use Contribution as the basis for evaluating the performance of and allocating
resources to our operating segments.

13. Commitments and Contingencies

a.     Leases

We
lease most of our facilities under various operating leases. A majority of these leases have renewal options of five to ten years and have either fixed or Consumer Price Index
escalation clauses. We also lease equipment under operating leases, primarily computers which have an average lease life of three years. Trucks and office equipment are also leased and have remaining
lease lives ranging from one to seven years. Rent expense was $126,871, $125,866 and $134,371 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. There was $6,733, $5,915 and $0
related to synthetic lease facilities included in rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. See Note 3.

Minimum
future lease payments, net of sublease income of $2,238, $1,650, $767, $414, $267 and $560 for 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and thereafter, respectively, are as follows:

We
have guaranteed the residual value of certain vehicle operating leases to which we are a party. The maximum net residual value guarantee obligation for these vehicles as of
December 31, 2003 was


$679.
We believe that it is not reasonably likely that we will be required to perform under these guarantee agreements or that any performance requirement would have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

b.     South
Brunswick Fires Litigation

In
March 1997, we experienced three fires, all of which authorities have determined were caused by arson. The fires resulted in damage to one and destruction of another records
and information services facility in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey.

Certain
of our customers or their insurance carriers have asserted claims as a consequence of the destruction of, or damage to, their records as a result of the fires, including claims
with specific requests for compensation and allegations of negligence or other culpability on the part of Iron Mountain. We and our insurers have denied any liability on the part of Iron Mountain as
to all of these claims.

We
are presently aware of five pending lawsuits that have been filed against Iron Mountain by certain of our customers and/or their insurers, and one pending lawsuit filed by the
insurers of an abutter of one of the South Brunswick facilities. Five of these six lawsuits have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the Middlesex County, New Jersey, Superior
Court. The sixth lawsuit, brought by a single customer, is pending in the Supreme Court for New York County, New York. A seventh lawsuit, also brought by a single customer, was tried before a federal
judge in New Jersey in February 2000, with a defendant's verdict entered in favor of Iron Mountain. An eighth lawsuit filed by an injured firefighter is currently being settled by our insurer
for a nominal amount. Several other claims that were originally filed in relation to these lawsuits have been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by the customers, abutting business owners, and/or
their insurance carriers.

We
have denied liability and asserted affirmative defenses in all of the remaining cases arising out of the fires and, in certain of the cases, have asserted counterclaims for
indemnification against the plaintiffs. Discovery is ongoing. We deny any liability as a result of the destruction of, or damage to, customer records or property of abutters as a result of the fires,
which were beyond our control. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these and any other lawsuits that may arise.

Our
professional liability insurer, together with our general liability and property insurance carriers, have entered into a binding agreement with us regarding reimbursement of defense
costs and have agreed to ongoing discussions regarding any remaining coverage issues, further defense and/or settlement of these claims.

c.     Sequedex,
H-W Associates, Pioneer and Pierce Proceedings

On
March 28, 2002, Iron Mountain and Iron Mountain Information Management, Inc. ("IMIM"), one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, commenced an action in the Middlesex County,
New Jersey, Superior Court, Chancery Division, captioned Iron Mountain Incorporated and Iron Mountain Information Management, Inc. v. J. Peter Pierce, Sr., Douglas B. Huntley, J. Michael Gold,
Fred A. Mathewson, Jr., Michael DiIanni, J. Anthony Hayden, Pioneer Capital, LLC, and Sequedex, LLC. In the complaint, we alleged that defendant J. Peter Pierce, Sr., a former member of our Board of


Directors
and the former President of IMIM until his termination without cause effective June 30, 2000, violated his fiduciary obligations, as well as various noncompetition and other
provisions of an employment agreement with Iron Mountain, dated February 1, 2000, by providing direct and/or indirect financial, management and other support to defendant Sequedex. Sequedex was
established in October 2000, and competed directly with us in the records management information services industry. The complaint also alleged that Mr. Pierce and certain of the other
defendants, who were employed by or affiliated with Pierce Leahy Corp. prior to the merger of Pierce Leahy with Iron Mountain in February 2000, misappropriated and used our trade secrets and
other confidential information. Finally, the complaint asserted claims against Sequedex and others for tortious interference with contractual relations, against all of the defendants for civil
conspiracy in respect of the matters described above, and against defendant Michael DiIanni for breach of his employment agreement with IMIM, dated September 6, 2000. The litigation seeks
injunctions in respect of certain matters and recovery of damages against the defendants.

On
April 12, 2002, Iron Mountain also initiated a related arbitration proceeding against Mr. Pierce before the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Office of the American
Arbitration Association (the "AAA") pursuant to an arbitration clause in the employment agreement between Iron Mountain and Mr. Pierce. In the arbitration, Mr. Pierce counterclaimed for
indemnification of his expenses, including attorneys' fees. We disputed Mr. Pierce's claim. On July 19, 2002, the litigation was stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding.
On February 25, 2003, in response to Iron Mountain's request, the AAA removed the arbitrator. The arbitration proceeding was transferred by agreement of the parties to
ADR Options, Inc. On February 4, 2004, the arbitrator rendered a decision. The arbitrator did not find the evidence provided by us in our action against Mr. Pierce sufficient to
rule in our favor on the particular claims at issue. In addition, the arbitrator ruled that, pursuant to an indemnification provision in Mr. Pierce's employment agreement, we must pay
Mr. Pierce's attorneys fees and costs that are attributable to this single arbitration. The arbitrator has established a procedure to ascertain the amount of these fees and expenses, which, in
any case are not expected to be material to our financial position or results of operations. We have recently filed a motion to vacate the arbitrator's decision and award in Middlesex County, New
Jersey, where the pending action against Mr. Pierce and others is currently stayed.

On
December 16, 2002, Hartford Windsor Associates, L.P. ("H-W Associates"), Hartford General, LLC, J. Anthony Hayden, Mr. Pierce, Frank Seidman and John H.
Greenwald, Jr. commenced an action in the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, against Iron Mountain Incorporated. In the complaint, the plaintiffs allege that H-W
Associates purchased a warehouse property in Connecticut to serve as a records storage facility, and entered into a lease for the facility with Sequedex, then a competitor of ours, and that the
remaining plaintiffs were limited or general partners of H-W Associates. The plaintiffs also allege that we tortiously interfered with Sequedex's contractual relations with an actual or
prospective customer of Sequedex and, as a result, caused Sequedex to default on its lease to H-W Associates. The complaint seeks damages in excess of $100,000. We have denied the material
allegations in the complaint filed against us by H-W Associates and the other plaintiffs and have since filed counterclaims against the plaintiffs alleging tortious interference with our business
relationship with one of our longstanding customers. Discovery is proceeding.


Also
on December 16, 2002, Pioneer Capital L.P. ("Pioneer"), Pioneer Capital Genpar, Inc. ("PCG"), the general partner of Pioneer, and Mr. Pierce, the President of
PCG, commenced an action in the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, against Iron Mountain Incorporated, C. Richard Reese, John F. Kenny, Jr., Garry Watzke, Schooner Capital LLC
("Schooner") and Vincent J. Ryan. The named individuals are Directors and/or officers of Iron Mountain and Schooner is a shareholder of Iron Mountain. In the complaint, the plaintiffs allege that the
defendants had numerous conversations and arrangements with Mr. Carr, one of Mr. Pierce's and Pioneer's business partners in a company named Logisteq LLC. The plaintiffs further allege
that, as a result of such conversations and arrangements, defendants conspired to, and did intentionally, interfere with Pioneer's relationship with its partner and Logisteq. The plaintiffs also
allege that defendants damaged Mr. Pierce's reputation in the community by telling Iron Mountain employees and other third parties that Mr. Pierce breached his employment agreement with
Iron Mountain, misappropriated and used Iron Mountain's confidential information, breached his fiduciary duties to Iron Mountain's shareholders and assisted Sequedex, then a competitor of Iron
Mountain, in unfairly competing with Iron Mountain. Finally, the complaint alleges that the business partner in Logisteq taped conversations with Mr. Pierce and others which allegedly violated
privacy laws, that the defendants knew, or should have known, that the tapes were being made without the consent of the individuals and, as a result, Mr. Pierce was harmed. The complaint seeks
damages in excess of $5,000,000. Iron Mountain and the other defendants have challenged the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs' pleadings in each of these cases.

On
September 10, 2003, IMIM filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania in a matter related to the litigation between the Company and Sequedex,
Mr. Pierce and others disclosed above. The new matter names Sequedex, J. Michael Gold and Peter Hamilton as defendants, and alleges that in 2000 defendants Gold and Hamilton, both former IMIM
employees, used confidential and proprietary business information that they had obtained while employed by IMIM to form their own records management company, Sequedex. The complaint also alleges
unlawful interference with IMIM's contractual relationship with a certain customer and other matters. The defendants filed preliminary objections to our complaint and Iron Mountain has answered those
preliminary objections.

Prior
to the litigation directly pertaining to Mr. Pierce having been filed, in approximately October 2000, three former management employees of IMIM became employed by or
otherwise associated with Sequedex. IMIM commenced actions against these three former employees to enforce its rights under their confidentiality and non-competition agreements. IMIM has
also asserted claims against Sequedex for tortious interference with these agreements, and against both Sequedex and the former employees for misappropriation and use of IMIM's trade secrets and
confidential information.

The
defendants in all three cases have denied the material allegations in IMIM's complaints and asserted various affirmative defenses. In addition, Sequedex and the individual defendants
filed counterclaims against IMIM and third party complaints against Iron Mountain. The counterclaims and third party complaints assert claims for tortious interference with certain contracts and
prospective business relations between Sequedex and its current and potential customers as well as a claim for trade disparagement and defamation. The defendant in one of these actions sought a
declaratory judgment regarding the enforceability of the confidentiality and non-competition agreements at issue in


that
case and filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to have the non-competition agreement declared void, or to limit its scope. IMIM and Iron Mountain filed motions in all three
cases to dismiss the various counterclaims and third-party complaints. All of these motions, i.e., the defendants' motion for summary judgment and IMIM's and Iron Mountain's motions to dismiss, were
denied by the court following a hearing on May 7, 2002. As previously disclosed in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, Sequedex
furnished a preliminary statement of damages with an estimate of compensatory damages of approximately $172 million and an indication that Sequedex intended to seek punitive damages of
approximately $1.5 billion. Sequedex is no longer seeking damages in this amount and in connection with its proposed amended counterclaim, Sequedex has recently furnished a litigation expert's
report of damages claiming approximately $59 million plus approximately $6.6 million of pre-judgment interest. Sequedex has indicated that it also intends to seek punitive
damages in an undisclosed amount. Extensive discovery has been conducted in the three cases and is ongoing; on the basis of that discovery, it is our belief that Sequedex has not produced any material
evidence that we or IMIM acted wrongfully in any respect. Further, limited discovery has been conducted in respect of Sequedex's damages claim; on the basis of that discovery, we do not believe that
Sequedex has any foundation, and we believe that it cannot provide any foundation, for its damages calculations. We believe that the damages calculations submitted by Sequedex are not supported by
credible evidence and are subject to serious legal, methodological and factual deficiencies. A trial of the three actions in which the Sequedex counterclaims and third party complaints have been
asserted is scheduled to commence in April of 2004. IMIM, Sequedex and one of the individual defendants recently filed dispositive motions, including motions for summary judgment as to certain of the
claims. All of these motions were denied by the court following a hearing on February 24, 2004.

Discovery
is proceeding in each of these cases, other than the arbitration. We intend to prosecute these actions vigorously, as well as to defend ourselves vigorously against the
counterclaims and the third party complaints.

addition to the matters discussed above, we are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business with a portion of the defense and/or settlement costs being
covered by
various commercial liability insurance policies purchased by us. In the opinion of management, no other material legal proceedings are pending to which we, or any of our properties, are subject.

The
outcome of the South Brunswick fires, Sequedex, H-W Associates, Pioneer and Pierce proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Based on our present assessment of the situation,
after consultation with legal counsel, management does not believe that the outcome of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations,
although there can be no assurance in this regard.

14. Related Party Transactions

We lease space to an affiliated company, Schooner, for its corporate headquarters located in Boston, Massachusetts. For the years ended December 31, 2001,
2002 and 2003, Schooner paid rent to us totaling $101, $128 and $144, respectively. We lease facilities from an officer and three separate


limited
partnerships, whose general partner was a related party. Our aggregate rental payment for such facilities during 2001, 2002 and 2003 was $1,381, $1,372 and $1,309, respectively. In the opinion
of management, all of these leases were entered into at market prices and terms.

We
have an agreement with Leo W. Pierce, Sr., our former Chairman Emeritus and the father of J. Peter Pierce, our former director, that requires pension payments of $8 per month until
his death. The total benefit is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in the amount of $922 as of December 31, 2003.

At
December 31, 2003, we have outstanding loans to an officer with an aggregate principal amount of $331. These notes bear interest at a variable rate. This liability was assumed
in connection with our merger with Pierce Leahy.

15. Employee Benefit Plans

a.     Iron
Mountain Companies 401(k) Plan

We
have a defined contribution plan, which generally covers all non-union U.S. employees meeting certain service requirements. Eligible employees may elect to defer from 1%
to 25% of compensation per pay period up to the amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, IME operates a defined contribution plan, which is similar to the U.S.'s 401(k) Plan. We make
matching contributions based on the amount of an employee's contribution in accordance with the plan document. We have expensed $2,466, $3,043 and $4,164 for the years ended December 31, 2001,
2002 and 2003, respectively.

b.     Employee
Stock Purchase Plan

On
March 23, 1998, we introduced an employee stock purchase plan (the "Plan"), participation in which is available to substantially all employees who meet certain service
eligibility requirements. The Plan was approved by our shareholders on May 28, 1998 and commenced operations on October 1, 1998. The Plan provided a way for our eligible employees to become
shareholders on favorable terms. The Plan provided for the purchase of up to 562,500 shares of our common stock by eligible employees through successive offering periods. At the start of each offering
period, participating employees were granted options to acquire our common stock. As there were no shares remaining in the Plan on December 31, 2002, a new employee stock purchase plan (the
"2003 Plan"), which provides for the purchase of up to 750,000 shares of our common stock was approved by our shareholders in May 2003 and commenced operations on July 1, 2003. During each
offering period, participating employees accumulate after-tax payroll contributions, up to a maximum of 15% of their compensation, to pay the exercise price of their options. At the end of
the offering period, outstanding options are exercised, and each employee's accumulated contributions are used to purchase our common stock. The price for shares purchased under the Plan was, and
under the 2003 Plan is, 85% of their market price at either the beginning or the end of the offering period, whichever was or is lower. There were 186,152, 160,119 and 88,715 shares purchased under
the Plan and the 2003 Plan for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. The number of shares available for grant at December 31, 2003 was 661,285.


16. Subsequent Events

In February 2004, we completed the acquisition of Mentmore plc's 49.9% equity interest in IME for total consideration of 82,500 British pounds sterling ($154,000)
in cash from proceeds of our 7


/


% notes issued in January 2004. Included in this amount is the repayment of all trade and working capital
funding owed to Mentmore by IME. Completion of the transaction gives us 100% ownership of IME, affording us full access to all future cash flows and greater strategic and financial flexibility. This
transaction should have no impact on revenue or operating income since we already fully consolidate IME's financial results. Since we will be using the purchase method of accounting for this
acquisition, 49.9% of the net assets of IME will be adjusted to reflect their fair market value if different from their current carrying value.

In
March 2004, IME and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the "IME Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of European lenders. The IME Credit Agreement provides
for maximum borrowing availability in the principal amount of 210,000 British pounds sterling, including a 100,000 British pounds sterling revolving credit facility

(

which includes the ability to borrow
in certain other foreign currencies

)

, a 100,000 British pounds
sterling term loan, and a 10,000 British pounds sterling overdraft protection line. The revolving credit facility matures on March 2, 2009. The term loan facility is payable in three
installments; two installments of 20,000 British pounds sterling on March 2, 2007 and 2008, respectively, and the final payment of the remaining balance on March 2, 2009. The interest
rate on borrowings under the IME Credit Agreement is based on LIBOR and varies depending on IME's choice of interest rate period, plus an applicable margin. The IME Credit Agreement includes various
financial covenants applicable to the results of IME, which may restrict IME's ability to incur indebtedness under the IME Credit Agreement and with third parties. Each of IME's subsidiaries will
either guarantee the obligations or pledge shares to secure the IME Credit Agreement. We have not guaranteed or otherwise provided security for the IME Credit Agreement nor have any of our U.S.,
Canadian, Mexican and South American subsidiaries.

In
March 2004, IME borrowed approximately 147,000 British pounds sterling under the IME Credit Agreement, including the full amount of the term loan. IME used those proceeds to
repay us 135,000 British pounds sterling related to our initial financing of the acquisition of the European operations of Hays IMS. We expect to use those proceeds to: (1) pay down
approximately $104,000 of real estate term loans, (2) settle all obligations associated with terminating our two cross currency swaps used to hedge the foreign currency impact of our
intercompany financing with IME, and (3) to pay down amounts outstanding under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. After the initial balance, IME's availability under the IME Credit
Agreement, based on its current level of external debt and the leverage ratio under the IME Credit Agreement, was approximately 9,000 British pounds sterling.


REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To
the Board of Directors of

Iron Mountain Europe Limited:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Iron Mountain Europe Limited as of October 31, 2002 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive (loss)/income and cash flows for the three years ended October 31, 2003. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
management of Iron Mountain Europe Limited. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Iron Mountain Europe Limited at
October 31, 2002 and 2003 and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the three years ended October 31, 2003, in conformity with generally
