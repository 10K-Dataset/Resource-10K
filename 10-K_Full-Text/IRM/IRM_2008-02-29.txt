PART I

Item 1.    Business.

A.    Development of Business.

We believe we are the global leader in information protection and storage services. We help organizations around the world reduce the costs and risks associated
with information protection and storage. We offer comprehensive records management and data protection solutions, along with the expertise and experience to address complex information challenges such
as rising storage costs, litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery. Founded in an underground facility near Hudson, New York in 1951, Iron Mountain is a trusted partner to more than
100,000 corporate clients throughout North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. We have a diversified customer base comprised of commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting,
insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 93% of the Fortune 1000 and more than 90% of the FTSE 100. As of December 31, 2007, we provided services in 37
countries on five continents, employed over 20,000 people and operated over 1,000 records management facilities.

Now
in our 57th year, we have experienced tremendous growth, particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in February 1996. We have
grown from a business with limited product offerings and annual revenues of $104 million in 1995 into a global enterprise providing a broad range of information protection and storage services
to customers in markets around the world with total revenues of $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Our
growth between 1995 and 2000 was accomplished primarily through the acquisition of U.S. information protection and storage services companies. In 2001, internal revenue growth
exceeded growth through acquisitions for the first time since we began our acquisition program in 1996. This has been the case in each year since 2001 with the exception of 2004, when revenue growth
from acquisitions exceeded internal revenue growth due primarily to the acquisition of the records management operations of Hays plc ("Hays IMS") in July 2003. In the absence of unusual
acquisition activity, we expect to achieve most of our revenue growth internally in 2008 and beyond.

In
2007, our U.S. physical businesses were supplemented by two significant acquisitions: ArchivesOne, Inc. ("ArchivesOne") in May and RMS Services—USA, Inc.
("RMS") in September. In December 2007 our digital business was supplemented by the acquisition of Stratify Inc. ("Stratify"). Prior to 2007, we completed two significant digital acquisitions:
Connected Corporation ("Connected") in November 2004 and LiveVault Corporation ("LiveVault") in December 2005. We expect our digital acquisitions will be of two primary types, those that bring us new
or improved technologies to enhance our existing technology portfolio and those that increase our market position through technology and established revenue streams.

We
expect to achieve our internal revenue growth objectives primarily through a sophisticated sales and account management coverage model designed to drive incremental revenues by
acquiring new customer relationships and increasing business with new and existing customers by selling them our products and services in new geographies and selling additional products and services
such as secure shredding, digital data protection, document management services and eDiscovery services. These selling efforts will be augmented and supported by an expanded marketing program, which
includes product management as a core discipline. We are also developing an extensive worldwide network of channel partners through which we are selling a wide array of technology solutions, primarily
our digital data protection and recovery products and services.


B.    Description of Business.

Overview

Our information protection and storage services can be broadly divided into three major service categories: records management, data protection and recovery, and
information destruction. We offer
both physical services and technology solutions in each of these categories. Media formats can be broadly divided into physical and electronic records. We define physical records to include paper
documents, as well as all other non-electronic media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, X-rays and blueprints. Electronic records include
various forms of magnetic media such as computer tapes and hard drives and optical disks.

Our
physical records management services include: records management program development and implementation based on best-practices to help customers comply with specific
regulatory requirements, implementation of policy-based programs that feature secure, cost-effective storage for all major media, including paper (which is the dominant form of records
storage), flexible retrieval access and retention management. Our technology-based records management services are comprised primarily of digital archiving and related services for secure, legally
compliant and cost-effective long-term archiving of electronic records. Within the records management services category, we have developed specialized services for vital
records and regulated industries such as healthcare, energy and financial services.

Our
physical data protection & recovery services include disaster preparedness, planning, support and secure, off-site vaulting of data backup media for fast and
efficient data recovery in the event of a disaster, human error or virus. Our technology-based data protection & recovery services include online backup and recovery solutions (also known as
electronic vaulting) for desktop and laptop computers and remote servers. Additionally, we serve as a trusted, neutral third party and offer technology escrow services to protect and manage source
code and other proprietary information.

Our
information destruction services are comprised almost exclusively of secure shredding services. Secure shredding services complete the life cycle of a record and involve the
shredding of sensitive documents in a way that ensures privacy and a secure chain of custody for the records. These services typically include either the scheduled pick-up of loose office
records which customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide or the shredding of documents stored in records facilities upon the expiration of their scheduled retention
periods. Our technology-based information destruction services include DataDefense, which provides automatic, intelligent encryption of sensitive PC data and, when behaviors that are inconsistent with
authorized use are detected, that data is automatically eliminated and the PC is disabled—this is designed to render the data useless to unauthorized users.

In
addition to our core records management, data protection and recovery, and information destruction services, we sell storage materials, including cardboard boxes and magnetic media,
and provide consulting, facilities management, fulfillment and other outsourcing services.

Physical Records

Physical records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. Active records relate to ongoing and recently completed activities or contain
information that is frequently referenced. Active records are usually stored and managed on-site by the organization that originated them to ensure ready availability. Inactive physical
records are the principal focus of the information protection and storage services industry. Inactive records consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be
retained for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. A large and growing specialty subset of the physical records market is
medical records. These are active and semi-active records that are often


stored
off-site with and serviced by an information protection and storage services vendor. Special regulatory requirements often apply to medical records.

Electronic Records

Electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of recently processed data or
archival in nature. Customer needs for data backup and recovery and archiving are distinctively different. Backup data exists because of the need of many businesses to maintain backup copies of their
data in order to be able to recover the data in the event of a system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. It is customary (and a best practice) for data processing groups to rotate backup tapes
to off-site locations on a regular basis and to require multiple copies of such information at multiple sites.

In
addition to the physical rotation and storage of backup data that our physical business segments provide, our Worldwide Digital Business segment offers electronic vaulting services as
an alternative way for businesses to transfer data to us, and to access the data they have stored with us. Electronic vaulting is a Web-based service that automatically backs up computer
data from servers or directly from desktop and laptop computers over the Internet and stores it in one of our secure data centers. In early 2003, we announced an expansion of the electronic vaulting
service to include backup and recovery for personal computer data, answering customers' needs to protect critical business data, which is often unprotected on employee laptop and desktop personal
computers. In November 2004, we acquired Connected, a market leader in the backup and recovery of this distributed data, and in December 2005, we acquired LiveVault, a market leader in the backup and
recovery of server data.

There
is a growing need for better ways of archiving electronic records for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons and for occasional reference in support of ongoing business
operations. Historically, businesses have relied on backup tapes for storing archived data in electronic format, but this process
can be costly and ineffective when attempting to search and retrieve the data for litigation or other needs. In addition, many industries, such as healthcare and financial services, are facing
increased governmental regulation mandating the way in which electronic records are stored and managed. To help customers meet these growing storage challenges, we introduced digital archiving
services. We have experienced increasing market adoption of these services, especially for e-mail archiving, which enables businesses to identify and retrieve electronic records quickly
and cost-effectively, while maintaining regulatory compliance.

On
December 1, 2006, changes to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ("FRCP") were implemented; as a result, electronically stored information was explicitly defined as a separate
class of discoverable information in litigation. There is no longer any ambiguity about whether digital data constitutes a "document" and businesses now have the clear responsibility to produce
electronic records. In December 2007, we acquired Stratify, a leading provider of eDiscovery services to assist customers with managing discovery of electronic records.

We
believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they face in their physical records management programs and consist
primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access to and control over the data in a secure environment; and (3) the need to retain electronic records due
to regulatory requirements or for litigation support. Our digital services offerings are representative of our commitment to address evolving records management needs and expand the array of services
we offer.

Growth of Market

We believe that the volume of stored physical and electronic records will continue to increase for a number of reasons, including: (1) regulatory
requirements; (2) concerns over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of records; (3) inexpensive document


producing
technologies such as facsimile, desktop publishing software and desktop printing; (4) the continued proliferation of data processing technologies such as personal computers and
networks; (5) the high cost of reviewing records and deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and
(7) requirements to keep backup copies of certain records in off-site locations.

We
believe that paper-based information will continue to grow, not in spite of, but because of, "paperless" technologies such as e-mail and the Internet. These technologies
have prompted the creation of hard copies of such electronic information and have also led to increased demand for electronic records services, such as the storage and off-site rotation of
backup copies of magnetic media. In addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital information technologies and distributed data networks has created a growing need for efficient,
cost-effective, high quality technology solutions for electronic data protection, digital archiving and the management of electronic documents.

Consolidation of a Highly Fragmented Industry

There was significant consolidation within the highly fragmented information protection and storage services industry in North America from 1995 to 2000 and at a
slower but continuing pace in recent years. Most information protection and storage services companies serve a single local market, and are often either owner-operated or ancillary to another
business, such as a moving and storage company. We believe that the consolidation trend, both in North America and other regions, will continue because of the industry's capital requirements for
growth, opportunities for large information protection and storage services providers to achieve economies of scale and customer demands for more sophisticated technology-based solutions.

We
believe that the consolidation trend in the industry is also due to, and will continue as a result of, the preference of certain large organizations to contract with one vendor in
multiple cities and countries for multiple services. In particular, larger customers increasingly demand a single, sophisticated company to handle all of their important physical and electronic
records needs. Large national and multinational companies are better able to satisfy these demands than smaller competitors. We have made, and intend to continue to make from time to time,
acquisitions of our competitors, many of whom are small, single-city operators.

Description of Our Business

We generate our revenues by providing storage for both physical and electronic records in a variety of information media formats, core records management, data
protection & recovery, and information destruction services and an expanding menu of complementary products and services to a large and diverse customer base. Providing outsourced information
protection and storage services is the mainstay of our customer relationships and provides the foundation for our revenue growth. Core services, which are a vital part of a comprehensive records
management program, consist primarily of the handling and transportation of stored records and information. In our secure shredding operations, core services consist primarily of the scheduled
collection and handling of records and documents generated by business operations. As is the case with storage revenues, core service revenues are highly recurring in nature and therefore very
predictable. In 2007, our storage and core service revenues represented approximately 85% of our total consolidated revenues. In addition to our core services, we offer a wide array of complementary
products and services such as performing special project work, selling records management services related products, providing fulfillment services and consulting on records management issues. These
services address more specific needs and are designed to enhance our customers' overall records management programs. These services complement our core services; however, they are more episodic and
discretionary in nature. Revenue generated by all of our operating segments includes both core and complementary components.


Our
various operating segments offer the products and services discussed below. In general, our North American Physical Business segment offers physical records management services,
including business records management, healthcare information services, vital records services, physical data protection & recovery services, service and courier operations, secure shredding,
fulfillment and consulting services, in the U.S. and Canada. Our International Physical Business segment offers elements of our physical product and services lines outside the U.S. and Canada. Our
Worldwide Digital Business segment includes our online backup and recovery solutions for server data and personal computers, digital archiving services, eDiscovery services, intellectual property
management services and electronic information destruction services. Some of our complementary services and products are offered within all of our segments. The amount of revenues derived from our
North American Physical Business, International Physical Business and Worldwide Digital Business operating segments and other relevant data, including financial information about geographic areas and
product and service lines, for fiscal years 2005, 2006 and 2007 are set forth in Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Service Offerings

Business Records Management

The hard copy business records stored by our customers by their nature are not very active. These records are typically stored in cartons packed by the customer.
We use a proprietary order processing and inventory management system known as the SafekeeperPLUS® system to efficiently store and later retrieve a customer's cartons. Storage charges are
generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis, usually either per carton or per cubic foot of records, and include the provision of space, racking, computerized inventory and activity tracking
and physical security.

Healthcare Information Services

Healthcare information services principally include the handling, storage, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records used by hospitals, private
practitioners and other medical institutions. Medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide easier access to individual
files. Healthcare information services also include recurring
project work and ancillary services. Recurring project work involves the on-site removal of aged patient files and related computerized file indexing. Ancillary healthcare information
services include release of information (medical record copying), temporary staffing, contract coding, facilities management and imaging.

Vital Records Services

Vital records contain critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film and other highly proprietary information. Vital records may
require special facilities or services, either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. Our charges for providing enhanced security and special climate-controlled
environments for vital records are higher than for typical storage services. We provide the same ancillary services for vital records as we provide for our other storage operations.

Physical Data Protection & Recovery Services

Physical data protection & recovery services consist of the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery and
business continuity plans. Computer tapes, cartridges and disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where
they are available to customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to facilitate data recovery in the event of a disaster. Frequently, back-up tapes are then rotated


from
our facilities back to our customers' data centers. We use various proprietary information technology systems such as MediaLink™, SecureSync™ and SecureBase™
software to manage this process. We also manage tape library relocations and support disaster recovery testing and execution.

Service and Courier Operations

Service and courier operations are an integral part of our comprehensive records management program for all physical media including paper and certain records on
magnetic media. They include adding records to storage, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, permanent withdrawals from storage, destruction of records and the
rotation of back-up computer media. Service charges are generally assessed for each procedure on a per unit basis. The SafekeeperPLUS system controls the service processes from order entry
through transportation and
invoicing for business records management while the MediaLink and SecureBase systems manage the process for the physical data protection services business.

Courier
operations consist primarily of the pick-up and delivery of records upon customer request. Charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and
location and are billed monthly. As of December 31, 2007, we were utilizing a fleet of approximately 3,500 owned or leased vehicles.

Secure Shredding

Secure shredding is a natural extension of our hardcopy records management services, completing the life cycle of a record, and involves the shredding of
sensitive documents for corporate customers that, in many cases, also use our services for management of less sensitive archival records. These services typically include the scheduled
pick-up of loose office records which customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide or the shredding of documents stored in records facilities upon the expiration
of their scheduled retention periods. Complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste paper to third-party recyclers. Through a combination of plant-based shredding
operations and mobile shredding units comprised of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our customers in all of our existing markets throughout the U.S., Canada and
U.K.

Document Management Solutions

The focus of our Document Management Solutions ("DMS") is to develop, implement and support comprehensive document management solutions for the complete lifecycle
of our customers' information. We seek to develop solutions that solve our customers' document management challenges by integrating the management of physical records, document conversion and digital
storage. DMS complements our core physical and digital service offerings, leveraging our global footprint and our existing customer relationships. We differentiate our offerings by providing solutions
that integrate and extend our existing portfolio of products and services.

The
trend towards increased usage of Electronic Document Management ("EDM") systems represents a tremendous opportunity for us. In addition to our existing archival storage services,
there is increased opportunity to manage all active records. DMS services provide the bridge between customers' physical documents and their new EDM solutions.

Electronic Vaulting Services

Electronic vaulting is our Web-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop or laptop computers over
the Internet and stores it in one of our secure data centers. Customers use our Connected® backup for PC software product for electronic vaulting of desktop or laptop computer data and our
LiveVault® server data backup and recovery


product
for electronic vaulting of server data. Customers can choose our off-site hosted Software as a Service solution or they can license the software from us as part of a customer
on-site solution.

Digital Archiving Services

Our digital archiving services focus on archiving digital information with long-term preservation requirements. These services represent the digital
analogy to our physical records management services. Because of increased litigation risks and regulatory mandates, such as the changes to the FRCP that explicitly define electronically stored
information as a separate class of discoverable information, companies are increasingly aware of the need to apply the same records management policies and retention schedules to electronic data as
they do physical records. Typical digital records include e-mail, e-statements, images, electronic documents retained for legal or compliance purposes and other data
documenting business transactions.

The
growth rate of mission-critical digital information is accelerating, driven in part by the use of the Internet as a distribution and transaction medium. The rising cost and
increasing importance of digital information management, coupled with the increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may create meaningful opportunities for us. We
continue to cultivate marketing and technology partnerships to support this anticipated growth.

Discovery Services

Our Discovery Services comprise a set of individual services and bundled solutions designed to address the legal discovery and corporate governance needs of our
customers. Those services and solutions allow our customers to collect, prepare, process, review, and produce data that may exist in either paper or digital form in response to internal
investigations, litigations or regulatory requests.

Electronic
discovery ("eDiscovery") is the component of legal discovery involving information that is converted into digital data or collected and processed in that form. Our eDiscovery
services, principally embodied by the Stratify® Legal Discovery application, help our customers identify, organize, analyze, and review particularly relevant or responsive information from
within the universe of electronic data generated during the normal course of their business. The ability of current content management technologies to capture and maintain several copies of
documents—including different versions of working drafts—underscores the challenges companies face in managing information for eDiscovery.

Our
consolidated suite of physical and digital discovery services has been designed to deliver a secure, end-to-end chain-of-custody,
while also reducing both risks and costs for our customers.

Intellectual Property Management Services

Our intellectual property management consist primarily of third party technology escrow services that protect intellectual property assets such as software source
code. In addition, we assist in securing intellectual property as collateral for lending, investments and joint ventures, in managing domain name registrations and transfers, and in providing
expertise and assistance to brokers and dealers in complying with electronic records regulations of the SEC.

Complementary Services and Products

We offer a variety of additional services which customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. These services include conducting records
inventories, packing records into cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. We also provide services for the management of active records
programs. We can provide these services, which generally


include
document and file processing and storage, both off-site at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel to perform management functions on-site at the
customer's premises.

Other
complementary lines of business that we operate include fulfillment services and professional consulting services. Fulfillment services are performed by our wholly-owned
subsidiary, Iron Mountain Fulfillment Services, Inc. ("IMFS"). IMFS stores customer marketing literature and delivers this
material to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' sites based on current and prospective customer orders. In addition, IMFS assembles custom marketing packages and orders, and manages
and provides detailed reporting on customer marketing literature inventories.

We
provide professional consulting services to customers, enabling them to develop and implement comprehensive records and information management programs. Our consulting business draws
on our experience in information protection and storage services to analyze the practices of companies and assist them in creating more effective programs of records and information management. Our
consultants work with these customers to develop policies and schedules for document retention and destruction.

We
also sell: (1) a full line of specially designed corrugated cardboard, metal and plastic storage containers; (2) magnetic media products including computer tapes,
cartridges and drives, tape cleaners and supplies and CDs; and (3) computer room equipment and supplies such as racking systems and furniture.

Financial Characteristics of Our Business

Our financial model is based on the recurring nature of our various revenue streams. The historical predictability of our revenues and the resulting operating
income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA") allow us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. For a more detailed definition and reconciliation of OIBDA and a discussion of why
we believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Non-GAAP Measures." Our primary financial goal has always been, and continues to be, to increase consolidated OIBDA in relation to capital invested, even as our
focus has shifted from growth through acquisitions to internal revenue growth. Our business has the following financial characteristics:

•

Recurring Revenues.

We derive a majority of our consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, fees
charged to customers based on the volume of records stored. Once a customer places physical records in storage with us and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed, for which we
typically receive a service fee, we receive recurring payments for storage fees without incurring additional labor or marketing expenses or significant capital costs. Similarly, contracts for the
storage of electronic backup media consist primarily of fixed monthly payments. Our quarterly revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 76 consecutive quarters. For each of the
five years 2003 through 2007, storage revenues, which are stable and recurring, have accounted for over 54% or more of our total consolidated revenues. This stable and growing storage revenue base
also provides the foundation for increases in service revenues and OIBDA.

•

Historically Non-Cyclical Storage Business.

We have not experienced any significant reductions in
our storage business as a result of past economic downturns, although we can give no assurance that this would be the case in the future. We believe that companies that have outsourced records
management services are less likely during economic downturns to incur the move-out costs and other expenses associated with switching vendors or moving their records management services
programs in-house. However, during a recent economic slowdown, the rate at which some customers added new cartons to their inventory was below historical levels. The net effect of these
factors has been the continued growth of our storage revenue base, albeit at a lower


rate.
For each of the five years 2003 through 2007, total net volume growth in North America has ranged between 6% and 8%.

•

Inherent Growth from Existing Physical Records Customers.

Our physical records customers have on average
generated additional cartons at a faster rate than stored cartons have been destroyed or permanently removed. We estimate that inherent growth from existing customers represents approximately half of
our total net volume growth, excluding acquisitions, in North America. We believe the consistent growth of our physical records storage revenues is the result of a number of factors, including:
(1) the trend toward increased records retention; (2) customer satisfaction with our services; and (3) the costs and inconvenience of moving storage operations
in-house or to another provider of information protection and storage services.

•

Diversified and Stable Customer Base.

As of December 31, 2007, we had over 100,000 corporate clients in a
variety of industries. We currently provide services to commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 93% of the
Fortune 1000 and 90% of the FTSE 100. No customer accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007. For each of the three
years 2005 through 2007, the average volume reduction due to customers terminating their relationship with us was less than 2%.

•

Capital Expenditures Related Primarily to Growth.

Our information protection and storage business requires
limited annual capital expenditures made in order to maintain our current revenue stream. For the years 2005 through 2007, over 85% of our aggregate capital expenditures were growth-related
investments, primarily in storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. These growth-related capital expenditures
are primarily discretionary and create additional capacity for increases in revenues and OIBDA. Since shifting our focus from growth through acquisitions to internal revenue growth, our capital
expenditures, made primarily to support our internal revenue growth, have generally exceeded the aggregate acquisition consideration we paid. This was not the case in 2003 due to the acquisition of
Hays IMS, in 2004 due to the acquisition of Connected and the 49.9% equity interest held by Mentmore plc ("Mentmore") in Iron Mountain Europe Limited ("IME") and 2007 due to the
acquisitions of ArchivesOne and Stratify. We expect this trend to continue in the future absent unusual acquisition activity.

Growth Strategy

Our objective is to maintain a leadership position in the information protection and storage services industry around the world, protecting and storing our
customers' information without regard to media format or geographic location. In the U.S. and Canada, we seek to be one of the largest information protection and storage services providers in each of
our markets. Internationally, our objectives are to continue to capitalize on our expertise in the information protection and storage services industry and to make additional acquisitions and
investments in selected international markets. Our primary avenues of growth are: (1) increased business with existing customers; (2) the addition of new customers; (3) the
introduction of new products and services such as secure shredding, electronic vaulting, eDiscovery and DMS; and (4) selective acquisitions in new and existing markets.

Growth from Existing Customers

Our existing customers storing physical records contribute to storage and storage-related service revenues growth because on average they generate additional
cartons at a faster rate than old cartons are destroyed or permanently removed. In order to maximize growth opportunities from existing


customers,
we seek to maintain high levels of customer retention by providing premium customer service through our local account management staff.

Our
sales coverage model is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by allocating our sales resources based on a sophisticated segmentation of our
customer base and selling additional records management, data protection & recovery and information destruction services, in new and existing markets, within our existing customer
relationships. We also seek to leverage existing business relationships with our customers by selling complementary services and products. Services include records tracking, indexing, customized
reporting, vital records management and consulting services.

Addition of New Customers

Our sales forces are dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer account relationships; (2) generating additional revenue
from existing customers; and (3) expanding new and existing customer relationships by effectively selling a wide array of complementary services and products. In order to accomplish these
objectives, our sales forces draw on our U.S. and international marketing organizations and senior management.

Introduction of New Products and Services

We continue to expand our portfolio of products and services. We have established a national presence in the secure shredding industry in the U.S., Canada and the
U.K. and offer our electronic vaulting management services worldwide. These new products and services allow us to further penetrate our existing customer accounts and attract new customers in
previously untapped markets.

Growth through Acquisitions

The goals of our current acquisition program are: to supplement internal growth in our physical businesses by continuing to establish a footprint in targeted
international markets and adding fold-in acquisitions both in the U.S. and internationally; and to accelerate our leadership and time to market in our digital businesses. We have a
successful record of acquiring and integrating information protection and storage services companies. Since January 1, 1996, when we began our acquisition program, we have completed more than
200 acquisitions in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific for total consideration of over $3.6 billion, including approximately $1 billion associated with our merger with
Pierce Leahy Corp. ("Pierce Leahy") in February 2000. We substantially completed our geographic expansion in North America, Europe and Latin America by 2003 and began our expansion into Asia Pacific
in 2005.

Acquisitions in the U.S. and Canada

We intend to continue our acquisition program in the U.S. and Canada focusing primarily on expanding geographically as necessary and building scale in some of our
smaller markets through "fold-in" acquisitions. However, given the small number of large acquisition prospects and our increased revenue base, future acquisitions are expected to be less
significant to overall U.S. and Canadian revenue growth.

International Acquisition Strategy

We also intend to continue to make acquisitions and investments in information protection and storage services businesses outside the U.S. and Canada. We have
acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire and invest in, information protection and storage services companies in countries, and, more specifically, markets within such countries, where we believe
there is sufficient demand from existing multinational customers or the potential for significant growth. Since beginning our international


expansion
program in January 1999, we have directly and through joint ventures, expanded our operations into 36 countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. These transactions have taken, and
may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of the entire business or controlling or minority investments, with a long-term goal of full ownership. In addition to the criteria we use to
evaluate U.S. and Canadian acquisition candidates, we also evaluate the presence in the potential market of our existing customers as well as the risks uniquely associated with an international
investment, including those risks described below.

The
experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important in our international acquisition strategy. As a result, we have formed joint ventures with, or acquired
significant interests in, target businesses throughout Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. We began our international expansion by acquiring a 50.1% controlling interest in each of our IME, Iron
Mountain South America, Ltd. ("IMSA") and Sistemas de Archivo Corporativo (a Mexican limited liability company) subsidiaries.

In
2006, we established a majority-owned joint venture serving four major markets in India, completed minority investments in information protection and storage businesses with
operations in Poland and Russia, and in 2007, we established a majority-owned joint venture in Asia Pacific for consideration of approximately $2 million giving us an initial presence in
Singapore, Hong Kong-SAR, China, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and Malaysia.

We
believe this strategy, rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets, better position us to expand the existing business. The local partner benefits from our expertise
in the information protection and storage services industry, our multinational customer relationships, our access to capital and our technology, and we benefit from our local partner's knowledge of
the market, relationships with local customers and their presence in the community.

Our
long-term goal is to acquire full ownership of each such business. To that end, in February 2004, we acquired the remaining 49.9% minority equity interest in IME, in
January 2005, we acquired the remaining 49.9% minority equity interest in IMSA and in April 2006, we acquired the remaining minority equity ownership in our Mexican operations. In addition, we have
bought out
partnership interests, in whole or in part, in Chile, Eastern Europe and the Netherlands. As a result of these transactions we own more than 98% of our international operations, measured as a
percentage of consolidated revenues.

Our
international investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as
fluctuations in currency valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors.

The
amount of our revenues derived from international operations and other relevant financial data for fiscal years 2005, 2006 and 2007 are set forth in Note 9 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, we derived approximately 28%, 30% and 32%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside of the U.S.
As of December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, we have long-lived assets of approximately 31%, 33% and 34%, respectively, from outside of the U.S.

Digital Growth and Technology Innovation Strategy

Similar to our physical businesses, we seek to grow revenues in our Worldwide Digital Segment by selling our products and services to existing and new customers.
Our focus on technology innovation allows us to bring leading products and services to market designed to solve customer problems in the areas of data protection and e-records management.
Our approach to innovation has three major components: build, buy and partner. We will build or develop our own technology in areas core to our


strategy
in order to protect and extend our lead in the market. Examples include, back up and archiving Software as a Service and data reduction technologies. Our technology acquisition strategy is
designed to accelerate our product strategy, leadership and time to market and past examples include the Connected, LiveVault and Stratify acquisitions. Finally, we are developing global technology
partnerships that complement our product and service offerings, allow us to offer a complete solution to the marketplace and keep us in contact with emerging technology companies.

Customers

Our customer base is diversified in terms of revenues and industry concentration. As of December 31, 2007, we had over 100,000 corporate clients in a
variety of industries. We currently provide services to commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government
organizations, including more than 93% of the Fortune 1000 and more than 90% of the FTSE 100. No customer accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007.

Competition

We compete with our current and potential customers' internal information protection and storage services capabilities. We can provide no assurance that these
organizations will begin or continue to use an outside company such as Iron Mountain for their future information protection and storage services.

We
compete with multiple information protection and storage services providers in all geographic areas where we operate. We believe that competition for customers is based on price,
reputation for reliability, quality of service and scope and scale of technology and that we generally compete effectively based on these factors.

We
also compete with other information protection and storage services providers for companies to acquire. Some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources.
If any such competitor were to devote additional resources to the information protection and storage services business and such acquisition candidates or focus their strategy on our markets, our
results of operations could be adversely affected.

Alternative Technologies

We derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage-related services. This storage requires significant physical space. Alternative
storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents. These technologies include computer media, microform, CD-ROM and optical disk. To date,
none of these technologies has replaced paper documents as the principal means for storing information. However, we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their
records in paper documents format. We continue to invest in additional services such as electronic vaulting and e-records management, designed to address our customers' need for efficient,
cost-effective, high quality solutions for electronic records and information management.

Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we employed over 11,600 employees in the U.S. and over 8,500 employees outside of the U.S. At December 31, 2007, an
aggregate of 585 employees were represented by unions in California, Georgia, New York and three cities in Canada.

All
non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability,
retirement/401(k) and accidental death and dismemberment plans. Unionized employees receive these types of benefits through their unions. In


addition
to base compensation and other usual benefits, all full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues,
profits, collections or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in which they work. Management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and unions. However, as of
December 31 2007, certain of our labor contracts had expired, and we were operating under the expired contracts while attempting to negotiate replacement agreements.

Insurance

For strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate
capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. Property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake, subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits
and deductibles. Property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. Separate excess policies
for insurer defined Critical Earthquake Zone exposures are maintained at what we believe to be appropriate limits and deductibles for that exposure. Included among other types of insurance that we
carry, subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles are: medical, workers compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse legal and directors and
officers liability policies. In 2002, we established a wholly-owned Vermont domiciled captive insurance company as a subsidiary; through the subsidiary we retain and reinsure a portion of our property
loss exposure.

Our
customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records stored with us. Our liability under these contracts
is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. We cannot assure you that where we have limitation of liability provisions that they will be enforceable
in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability. Also, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or
contain higher limits or
supplemental insurance arrangements. In addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific
terms, including storage and service pricing and service delivery terms. Our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. While we have had relatively few
disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and any disputes to date have not been material, we can give you no assurance that we will not have material disputes
in the future.

Environmental Matters

Some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use,
storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. In some instances these properties included the operation of underground storage tanks or the
presence of asbestos-containing materials. Although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we
have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. We therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or
use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be potentially liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to
address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the
contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. Environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. In addition, future
regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today.


We
transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers
all owned and leased locations. Coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs.

Reincorporation

On May 27, 2005, Iron Mountain Incorporated, a Pennsylvania corporation ("Iron Mountain PA"), reincorporated as a Delaware corporation. The reincorporation
was effected by means of a statutory merger (the "Merger") of Iron Mountain PA with and into Iron Mountain Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("Iron Mountain DE"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Iron
Mountain PA. In connection with the Merger, Iron Mountain DE succeeded to and assumed all of the assets and liabilities of Iron
Mountain PA. Apart from the change in its state of incorporation, the Merger had no effect on Iron Mountain PA's business, board composition, management, employees, fiscal year, assets or liabilities,
or location of its facilities, and did not result in any relocation of management or other employees. The Merger was approved at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 26, 2005. Upon
consummation of the Merger, Iron Mountain DE succeeded to Iron Mountain PA's reporting obligations and continued to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "IRM."

Item 1A.    Risk Factors.

Our businesses face many risks. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our businesses, financial condition or
results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. Our investors and prospective investors should consider the following risks and the information
contained under the heading "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" before deciding to invest in our securities.

Operational Risks

Governmental and customer focus on data security could increase our costs of operations. We may not be able to fully offset these costs through increases in our rates. In
addition, incidents in which we fail to protect our customers' information against security breaches could result in monetary damages against us and could otherwise damage our reputation, harm our
businesses and adversely impact our results of operations.

In reaction to publicized incidents in which electronically stored information has been lost, illegally accessed or stolen, most states have adopted breach of
data security statutes and regulations that require notification to consumers if the security of their personal information, such as social security


numbers,
is breached; other states are currently considering such legislation. In addition, the United States Congress is considering several bills that are intended to address data security through
various methods that include requiring notification to affected persons of breaches of data security. Our information security practices have been the subject of review or inquiry by governmental
agencies, and we may be subject to additional reviews or inquiries of governmental agencies in the future.

Continued
governmental focus on data security may lead to additional legislative action. In addition, the increased emphasis on information security is leading customers to request that
we take additional measures to enhance security and assume higher liability under our contracts. We have experienced incidents in which customers' backup tapes or other records have been lost, and we
have been informed by customers in some incidents that the lost media or records contained personal information. As a result of these legislative initiatives and client demands, we may have to modify
our operations with the goal of further improving data security. Any such modifications may result in increased expenses and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services
sufficiently to offset any increased expenses.

In
addition to increases in the costs of operations or potential liability that may result from a heightened focus on data security, our reputation may be damaged by any compromise of
security, accidental loss or theft of customer data in our possession. We believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers. If our
reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.

Our customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in interpretation.

Our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records stored with us. Our
liability under these contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. We cannot assure you
that where we have limitation of liability provisions that they will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability. In addition to provisions limiting our liability, our
standard storage and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage and service pricing and service delivery terms. Our customers may
dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. While we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and any disputes
to date have not been material, we can give you no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future.

We face competition for customers.

We compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal information protection and storage services capabilities. These
organizations may not begin or continue to use an outside company, such as our company, for their future information protection and storage services needs. We also compete, in both our physical and
digital businesses, with multiple information protection and storage services providers in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors
instead of us.

We may not be able to effectively operate and expand our digital businesses.

We operate certain digital information storage and protection businesses and are implementing a planned expansion into other digital businesses. Our participation
in these markets poses certain unique risks. For example, we may be unable to:

•

raise
the amount of capital necessary to effectively participate in these markets;


•

successfully
acquire and integrate businesses or technologies to complement our current service offerings;

•

keep
up with rapid technological changes, evolving industry expectations and changing customer requirements;

•

develop,
hire or otherwise obtain the necessary technical expertise;

•

accurately
predict the size of the markets for any of these services; or

•

compete
effectively against other companies that possess greater technical expertise, capital or other necessary resources.

In
addition, the digital solutions we offer may not gain or retain market acceptance, or business partners upon whom we depend for technical and management expertise, as well as the
hardware and software products we need to complement our services, may not perform as expected.

Our customers may shift from paper storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space.

We derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage related services. This storage requires significant physical space, which we
provide through our owned and leased facilities. Alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents. These technologies include computer media,
microform, CD-ROM and optical disk. We can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their records in paper documents format. A significant shift by our
customers to storage of data through non-paper based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses.

We may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our businesses.

Because our physical businesses are heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. Such risks include:

•

variable
occupancy costs and difficulty locating suitable sites due to fluctuations in real estate markets;

•

uninsured
losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as
earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities;

•

inability
to use our real estate holdings effectively if the demand for physical storage were to diminish because of customers' acceptance of other storage technologies; and

•

liability
under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not we know of, or were
responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property.


Some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the use, storage, generation
and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. In some instances these properties included the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of
asbestos-containing materials. Although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not
undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. We therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell,
rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. Environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. In addition,
future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today.

International operations may pose unique risks.

As of December 31, 2007, we provided services in 36 countries outside the U.S. As part of our growth strategy, we expect to continue to acquire or invest
in information protection and storage services businesses in foreign markets. International operations are subject to numerous risks, including:

•

the
impact of foreign government regulations;

•

the
volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate;

•

political
uncertainties;

•

the
risk that the business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise outside of the U.S. will not perform as expected;

•

differences
in business practices; and

•

foreign
currency fluctuations.

In
particular, our net income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currencies associated with certain intercompany balances of our foreign subsidiaries to us and between our
foreign subsidiaries.

We may be subject to claims that our technology, particularly with respect to digital services, violates the intellectual property rights of a third party.

Third parties may have legal rights, including ownership of patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights, to ideas, materials, processes names or original
works that are the same or similar to those we use, especially in our digital business. Third parties may bring claims, or threaten to bring claims, against us that these intellectual property rights
are being infringed or violated by our use of intellectual property. Litigation or threatened litigation could be costly and distract our senior management from operating our business. Further, if we
cannot establish our right or obtain the right to use the intellectual property on reasonable terms, we may be required to develop alternative intellectual property at our expense to mitigate
potential harm.

Risks Relating to Our Common Stock

No History of Dividend Payments

We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We may retain future earnings, if any, for the development of our business and we do not
anticipate paying cash dividends on or repurchasing our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any determinations by us to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future or repurchase our
common stock will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations and business requirements. The terms of our credit


agreement
and our indentures contain provisions permitting the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases subject to certain limitations.

Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments.

We have a significant amount of indebtedness. The following table shows important credit statistics as of December 31, 2007:

At December 31, 2007

Our
substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you. Our indebtedness may increase as we continue to borrow under existing and future credit arrangements in order to
finance future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes, which would increase the associated risks. These risks include:

•

inability
to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments;

•

inability
to adjust to adverse economic conditions;

•

inability
to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases of our various
indebtedness;

•

limits
on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information protection and storage services industry;

•

limits
on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs;

•

inability
to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments; and

•

restrictions
on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms.

Restrictive loan covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy.

Our credit facility and our indentures contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things:

•

incur
additional indebtedness;

•

pay
dividends or make other restricted payments;

•

make
asset dispositions;

•

create
or permit liens; and

•

make
capital expenditures and other investments.

These
restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies.


We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness upon a change of control event as required by
our indentures.

Upon the occurrence of a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness. However, it is possible
that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes or that restrictions in our revolving credit facility will not allow such
repurchases. In addition, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a "change of control" under
our indentures.

Since Iron Mountain is a holding company, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations depends in part on the operations of our subsidiaries.

Iron Mountain is a holding company, and substantially all of our assets consist of the stock of our subsidiaries and substantially all of our operations are
conducted by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to make payments on our various debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from
our subsidiaries. However, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by most, but not all, of our direct and indirect wholly owned U.S.
subsidiaries.

Acquisition and International Expansion Risks

Failure to manage our growth may impact operating results.

If we succeed in expanding our businesses, that expansion may place increased demands on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and
physical resources. If not managed effectively, these increased demands may adversely affect the services we provide to existing customers. In addition, our personnel, systems, procedures and controls
may be inadequate to support future operations. Consequently, in order to manage growth effectively, we may be required to increase expenditures to increase our physical resources, expand, train and
manage our employee base, improve management, financial and information systems and controls, or make other capital expenditures. Our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if
we encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth.

Failure to successfully integrate acquired operations could negatively impact our future results of operations.

The success of any acquisition depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve
unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. We can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to
effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business. Nor can we assure you that we will be able to maintain or improve the historical financial performance of Iron Mountain or our
acquisitions. The failure to successfully integrate these cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We may be unable to continue our international expansion.

Our growth strategy involves expanding operations into international markets, and we expect to continue this expansion. Europe and Latin America have been our
primary areas of focus for international expansion and we have begun our expansion into the Asia Pacific region. We have entered into joint ventures and have acquired all or a majority of the equity
in information protection and storage services businesses operating in these areas and are actively pursuing additional opportunities.


This
growth strategy involves risks. We may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future. For example, we may be unable to:

•

identify
suitable companies to acquire;

•

complete
acquisitions on satisfactory terms;

•

incur
additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies if we are unable to pay the purchase price out of working capital, common stock or other equity securities; or

•

enter
into successful business arrangements for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise outside of the U.S.

We
also compete with other information protection and storage services providers for companies to acquire. Some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources.
If any such competitor were to devote additional resources to pursue such acquisition candidates or focus its strategy on our international markets, the purchase price for potential acquisitions, or
investments could rise, competition in international markets could increase and our results of operations could be adversely affected.

As of December 31, 2007, we conducted operations through 814 leased facilities and 220 facilities that we own. Our facilities are divided among our
reportable segments as follows: North American Physical Business (702), International Physical Business (318) and Worldwide Digital Business (14). These facilities contain a total of
64.7 million square feet of space. Facility rent expense was $169.9 million and $197.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. The leased
facilities typically have initial lease terms of ten to fifteen years with one or more five year options to extend. In addition, some of the leases contain either a purchase option or a right of first
refusal upon the sale of the property. Our facilities are located throughout North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, with the largest number of facilities in California, Florida,
Illinois, New Jersey, Texas, Canada and the U.K. We believe that the space available in our facilities is adequate to meet our current needs, although future growth may require that we acquire
additional real property either by leasing or purchasing. See Note 10 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our minimum annual rental commitments.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Louisiana Office of Student Financial Assistance Proceedings

On September 19, 2007, back-up media belonging to one of our customers, the Louisiana Office of Student Financial Assistance ("LOSFA"), was
lost while being transported to the customer's office. We immediately undertook and continue to engage in efforts to locate the media and we promptly notified LOSFA and appropriate law enforcement
authorities; however, to date, the media has not been found. Beginning on October 15, 2007, LOSFA issued one or more press releases and other public communications advising of the loss,
indicating that personally identifiable information was on the media and advising persons who might be affected as to how to protect themselves against possible identity theft and fraud. LOSFA has
demanded that we indemnify it in connection with any losses arising from the lost media. In late October 2007 and early November 2007, actions seeking to represent a purported class of allegedly
affected individuals were filed in state courts in West Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in the 18th Judicial District for the Parish of West Baton Rouge (West Baton


Rouge),
in New Orleans, Louisiana, in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans (New Orleans), and in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana (Eastern District
of Louisiana). These actions seek monetary damages under various theories of liability as a result of the lost media. We removed the first of those actions (West Baton Rouge) to the United States
District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana where, subsequently, it was voluntarily dismissed. We removed the second action (New Orleans) to the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Louisiana, where it was consolidated with the third such action, Melancon, et al. v. Louisiana Office of Student Financial Assistance, et al. (Eastern District of Louisiana). We have
formally answered the complaints in these two remaining actions, denying liability and asserting various affirmative defenses. We have also notified our insurers and intend to continue to defend these
cases vigorously.

London Fire

In July 2006, we experienced a significant fire in a leased records and information management facility in London, England that resulted in the complete
destruction of the facility and its contents. The London Fire Brigade issued a report in which it was concluded that the fire resulted from human agency, i.e., arson, and its report to the Home
Office concluded that the fire resulted from a deliberate act. The London Fire Brigade also concluded that the installed sprinkler system failed to control the fire due to the primary fire pump being
disabled prior to the fire and the standby fire pump being disabled in the early stages of the fire by third-party contractors. We have received notices of claims from customers or their subrogated
insurance carriers under various theories of liabilities arising out of lost data and/or records as a result of the fire. We deny any liability in respect of the London fire and we have referred these
claims to our primary warehouse legal liability insurer for an appropriate response. Certain of the claims have also been settled for nominal amounts, typically one to two British pounds sterling per
carton, as specified in the contracts, which amounts have been or will be reimbursed to us from our primary property insurer. On or about April 12, 2007, a firm of British solicitors
representing 31 customers and/or their subrogated insurers has filed a Claim Form in the (U.K.) High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, seeking unspecified damages in excess of
15 thousand British pounds sterling on account of the records belonging to those customers that were
destroyed in the fire. We have also been informed that, on or about April 20, 2007, another firm of British solicitors representing 21 customers and/or their subrogated insurer also filed a
Claim Form in the same court seeking provisional damages of approximately 15 million British pounds sterling on account of the records belonging to those customers that were destroyed in the
fire. Both of those matters are being held in abeyance by agreement between the claimants and the solicitors appointed by our primary warehouse legal liability carrier and some of them have been
settled for nominal amounts. However, many of these claims, including larger ones, remain outstanding. On or about October 17, 2007, our primary warehouse legal liability carrier, in the name
of our subsidiary Iron Mountain (U.K.) Limited, filed a Claim Form with the (U.K.) High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, Commercial Court, against The Virgin Drinks Group Limited, a customer
who had records destroyed in the fire, seeking a declaration to the effect that our liability to that customer is limited to a maximum of one British pound sterling per carton of lost records and, in
any event, to a maximum of 0.5 million British pound sterling in the aggregate, in accordance with the parties' contract. Detailed Particulars of Claim in respect of that matter were filed and
served on January 18, 2008. Finally, we have recently been served with a counterclaim for 5 thousand British pounds sterling by Sucre Export London Ltd., a customer which lost
records in the fire, in connection with a U.K. Small Claims Court action in which we are seeking approximately 3.5 thousand British pounds sterling in unpaid charges that are not disputed by
the customer. We have referred that matter as well to our primary warehouse legal liability insurer for a formal response. We deny any liability to Sucre Export London Ltd. in respect of its
Small Claims Court counterclaim.

We
believe we carry adequate property and liability insurance. We do not expect that this event will have a material impact to our consolidated results of operations or financial
condition.


General

In addition to the matters discussed above, we are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business with a portion of the defense
and/or settlement costs being covered by various commercial liability insurance policies purchased by us. In the opinion of management, no material legal proceedings are pending to which we, or any of
our properties, are subject.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders of Iron Mountain during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007.


PART II

Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol "IRM." On December 7, 2006, our board authorized and approved a
three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a dividend on our common stock. We issued the additional shares of common stock resulting from this stock dividend on
December 29, 2006 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 18, 2006.

The
following table sets forth the high and low sale prices on the NYSE, for the years 2006 and 2007, giving effect to such stock split:

The
closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on February 15, 2008 was $33.84. As of February 15, 2008, there were 546 holders of record of our common stock. We believe
that there are more than 79,000 beneficial owners of our common stock.

The
only dividends we have paid on our common stock during the last two years was the stock dividend paid in connection with the stock split referenced above. Our Board may retain future
earnings, if any, for the development of our business and does not anticipate paying cash dividends on or repurchasing our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any determinations by our Board to
pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future or repurchase our common stock will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations and business requirements. The terms of
our credit agreement and our indentures contain provisions permitting the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases subject to certain limitations.

There
was no common stock repurchased or sales of unregistered securities for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data.

The following selected consolidated statements of operations, balance sheet and other data have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements.
The selected consolidated financial and operating information set forth below, giving effect to stock splits, should be read in conjunction with Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Effective
December 31, 2005, we adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143." As a result, a non-cash charge of $2,751 net of tax benefit was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 as a
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See Note 2(f) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" and the Consolidated Financial
Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing.

This
discussion contains "forward-looking statements," as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other federal securities laws. See
"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" on page ii of this filing and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" beginning on page 14 of this filing.

Overview

Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service and storage material sales revenues. Storage revenues, both physical and digital, which are considered
a key performance indicator for the information protection and storage services industry, consist of largely recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per
unit basis), which are typically retained by customers for many years, and have accounted for over 54% of total consolidated revenues in each of the last five years. Our quarterly revenues from these
fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 76 consecutive quarters. Service and storage material sales revenues are comprised of charges for related


service
activities and courier operations and the sale of software licenses and storage materials. Included in service and storage materials sales are related core service revenues arising from:
(1) the handling of records including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, destruction of records, and permanent withdrawals from
storage; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other
recurring services including maintenance and support contracts. Our complementary services revenues, included in service and storage material sales, arise from special project work, including data
restoration, providing fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales, including software licenses, specially designed storage containers, magnetic media (including computer tapes) and
related supplies. Our secure shredding revenues include the sale of recycled paper, the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility and reducing the predictability of
that revenue stream. As service and storage material sales and complementary services have grown at a faster pace then our storage revenues, storage revenues as a percent of consolidated revenues has
declined. Our consolidated revenues are also subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenue derived from outside the U.S. For the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, we derived approximately 28%, 30% and 32%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside the U.S.

We
recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided and customers are generally
billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts, including maintenance and support contracts, for customers
where storage fees or services are billed in advance, are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed.
Storage material sales are recognized when shipped to the customer and title has passed to the customer and include software license sales. Sales of software licenses to distributors are recognized at
the time a distributor reports that the software has been licensed to an end-user and all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.

Cost
of sales (excluding depreciation) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities), transportation expenses
(including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and
benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and
compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation. Trends in facility
occupancy costs are similarly impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot
occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties.

The
expansion of our European, secure shredding and digital services businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components. Our European and secure shredding operations are more
labor intensive than our core U.S. physical businesses and therefore increase our labor costs as a percent of consolidated revenues. This trend is partially offset by our digital services businesses,
which require significantly less direct labor. Our secure shredding operations incur less facility costs and higher transportation costs as a percent of revenues compared to our core physical
businesses.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing
personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars
and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation


levels,
achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance. The overhead structure of our expanding European and Asian
operations, as compared to our North American operations, is more labor intensive and has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage, which may result in an increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European and Asian operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results. Similarly, our digital services
business requires a higher level of overhead, particularly in the area of information technology, than our core physical businesses.

Our
adoption of the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148 has resulted in increasing amounts of selling, general and administrative expenses. We
began using the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves
recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. We adopted SFAS No. 123R,
"Share-Based Payment" effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method, as permitted under SFAS No. 123R. We record stock-based compensation expense for the cost of stock
options, restricted stock and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R beginning January 1, 2006.

Our
depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital-intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which
include racking,
building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationships and acquisition costs and core technology and is
impacted by the nature and timing of acquisitions.

Our
consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the
U.S. In 2006, we saw increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, and decreases in both revenues and expenses as a result of
the weakening of the British pound sterling and the Euro, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. During 2007, we have seen increases in both revenues and expenses
as a result of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, Euro and British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. It is
difficult to predict how much foreign currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future and how those fluctuations will impact individual balances reported in our consolidated statement of
operations. Given the relative increase in our international operations, these fluctuations may become material on individual balances. However, because both the revenues and expenses are denominated
in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income, operating margin and net income is mitigated.

Non-GAAP Measures

Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or OIBDA

OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses. OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing OIBDA by total revenues. We use these
measures to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated business. As such, we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. We use
OIBDA for planning purposes and multiples of current or projected OIBDA-based calculations in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to
evaluate acquisition targets. We believe OIBDA and OIBDA Margin are useful measures to evaluate our ability to grow our revenues faster than our operating expenses and they are an integral part of the
internal reporting


system
we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. OIBDA does not include certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically:
(1) minority interest in earnings (losses) of subsidiaries, net (2) other (income) expense, net (3) income from discontinued operations and loss on sale of discontinued operations
and (4) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our
capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses,
in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. OIBDA and OIBDA
Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites
States of America, or GAAP, such as operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP).

Critical Accounting Policies

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the estimates
used, including those related to accounting for acquisitions, allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation and
self-insured liabilities.
We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting
policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order:

Accounting for Acquisitions

Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence
of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning, and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated


future
results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources.

Each
acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition, including,
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, "Accounting for Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the
capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of
the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment. These estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating
leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. We are not aware of any information that would indicate that the final purchase price
allocations for acquisitions completed in 2007 would differ meaningfully from preliminary estimates. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
connection with each of our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings. Our restructuring
activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities, reductions in staffing levels, and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire. The estimated cost
of these restructuring activities are included as costs of the acquisition and are recorded as goodwill consistent with the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue
No. 95-3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination." While we finalize our plans to restructure the businesses we acquire within one year of
the date of acquisition, it may take more than one year to complete all activities related to the restructuring of an acquired business.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memos

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required
payments and disputes regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables and credit memo
activity, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a
significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. We consider accounts receivable to be delinquent after such time as reasonable
means of collection have been exhausted. We charge off uncollectible balances as circumstances warrant, generally, no later than one year past due. As of December 31, 2006 and 2007, our
allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos balance totaled $15.2 million and $19.2 million, respectively.

Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets

Assets subject to amortization:

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets," we review long-lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of
such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying
amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of
its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long-lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is based on discounted cash flows or
appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets.


Goodwill—Assets not subject to amortization:

We apply the provisions of SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets" to goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives which are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We have
selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2005, 2006 and 2007 and noted no impairment of
goodwill. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place
data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to
the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2007, no factors were identified that would alter this assessment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units,
the goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. Goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future
cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in
economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment in future periods. Our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis
as of October 31, 2007 were as follows: North America excluding Fulfillment; Fulfillment; U.K.; Continental Europe; Worldwide Digital Business excluding Iron Mountain Intellectual Property
Management, Inc. ("IPM"); IPM; South America; Mexico and Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific is primarily composed of recent acquisitions. It is still in the development stage and accordingly its fair
value does not exceed its carrying value by a significant margin at this point in time.

Accounting for Internal Use Software

We develop various software applications for internal use. We account for those costs in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position ("SOP")
98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." SOP 98-1 requires computer software costs associated with internal use
software to be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. SOP 98-1 also defines which types of costs should be capitalized and which should be expensed.
Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects, to the extent time is spent directly on
the project, are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the project has been completed and it is probable that the
application will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are evaluated for
impairment in accordance with SFAS No.144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."

It
may be necessary for us to write-off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. Our expansion into
new technology-based service offerings requires the development of internal use software that will be susceptible to rapid and significant changes in technology. We may be required to
write-off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the software's estimated
useful life. General uncertainties related to expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and market acceptance of our services, may adversely impact the recoverability of
these assets. As of December 31, 2006 and 2007, capitalized labor net of accumulated depreciation was $38.4 million and $47.5 million, respectively. See Note 2(f) to Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

During
the year ended December 31, 2007, we discontinued after implementation a product and wrote-off $1.3 million of previously deferred software costs to loss
on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we wrote-off $6.3 million of


previously
deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued prior to being implemented, and such costs are included as
a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we replaced internal use software programs, which resulted in the write-off to
loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of the remaining net book value of $1.1 million.

Income Taxes

We have recorded a valuation allowance, amounting to $43.4 million as of December 31, 2007, to reduce our deferred tax assets, primarily associated
with certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Additionally, we have federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards
of $11.8 million, which have no expiration date and are available to reduce future income taxes, if any, and foreign tax credits of $56.1 million, which begin to expire in 2016. Based on
current expectations and plans, we expect to fully utilize our foreign tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiration. If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we
may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets and foreign tax credit carryforwards and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we believe our estimates
are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our income
tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made.

In
July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"), an interpretation of SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS No. 109"), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company's financial statements in accordance with SFAS
No. 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return.

The
evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a two-step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby the company determines whether it is
more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The
second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial
statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

The
provisions of FIN 48 are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of this standard. Only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold
at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of FIN 48. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 should be reported as an
adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year.

We
adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 and, as a result, we recognized a $16.6 million increase in the reserve related to uncertain tax positions,
which was accounted for as a reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. Additionally, we grossed-up deferred tax assets and the reserve related to uncertain tax
positions in the amount of $7.9 million related to the federal tax benefit associated with certain state reserves. As of January 1, 2007, our reserve related to uncertain tax positions,
which is included in other long-term liabilities, amounted to $84.0 million. Of this amount, approximately $35.4 million, if settled favorably, would reduce our recorded
goodwill balance, with the remainder being recognized as a reduction of income tax expense.

We
are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments
by tax


authorities
and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $72.9 million of reserves related to uncertain tax positions. Of this amount,
approximately $27.0 million, if settled favorably, would reduce our recorded goodwill balance, with the remainder being recognized as a reduction of income tax expense. Although we believe our
tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in our estimates.

We
have elected to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements
of operations. We recorded $0.2 million, $0.9 million and $1.2 million for interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.

We
have $4.3 million and $3.6 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007, respectively.

We
have not provided deferred taxes on book basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future
and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis differences could be
reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries as well as certain other events or actions on our part, which would result in an increase in our provision for
income taxes.

Stock-Based Compensation

As of January 1, 2003, we adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148. As a result we began using the fair
value method of accounting for stock-based compensation in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. We adopted SFAS No. 123R effective
January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. We record stock-based compensation expense for the cost of stock options, restricted stock and shares issued under the employee stock
purchase plan based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R. Stock-based compensation expense, included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007 was $6.2 million ($4.8 million after tax or $0.02 per basic and diluted share), $12.4 million ($9.2 million after tax or $0.05 per
basic and diluted share) and $13.9 million ($10.2 million after tax or $0.05 per basic and diluted shares), respectively.

SFAS
No. 123R also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an
operating cash flow, reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in future periods.

The
fair values of option, employee stock purchase and restricted stock grants are estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility and
the expected term are the input factors to that model which require the most significant management judgment. Expected volatility is calculated utilizing daily historical volatility over a period that
equates to the expected life of the option. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees.

Self-Insured Liabilities

We are self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers' compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and general business
liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and short-term disability programs. At December 31, 2006 and 2007 there were approximately $28.2 million and
$33.5 million, respectively, of self-insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost
experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs


primarily
through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of
future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date.

We
believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any
estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these
expenses are appropriate. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS No. 157"). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on our financial position or results
of operations. In February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities
until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 115" ("SFAS No. 159"). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159
is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of
operations.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141R"), and SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statement—an amendment to ARB No. 51" ("SFAS No. 160"). SFAS No. 141R and No. 160 will require (a) more of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date, (b) liabilities related to contingent consideration to be remeasured at fair value in each
subsequent period, (c) an acquirer to expense as incurred acquisition-related costs, such as transaction fees for attorneys, accountants and investment bankers, as well as, costs associated
with restructuring the activities of the acquired company, and (d) noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries initially to be measured at fair value and classified as a separate component of
equity. SFAS No. 141R is effective and provided for prospective application for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 160 is required to apply
retrospectively in comparative financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The impact of SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 160 is dependent
upon the level of future acquisitions; however, they will generally result in (1) increased operating costs associated with the expensing of transaction and restructuring costs, as incurred,
(2) increased volatility in earnings related to the fair valuing of contingent consideration through earnings in subsequent periods, and (3) increased depreciation, amortization and
equity balances associated with the fair valuing of
noncontrolling interests and their classification as a separate component of consolidated stockholders' equity.

REVENUE

Our consolidated storage revenues increased $171.9 million, or 13.0%, to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 and
$145.6 million, or 12.3%, to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase is
attributable to internal revenue growth (8% during 2007 and 10% during 2006) resulting from solid net carton volume growth and the net result of pricing actions, acquisitions (2% during both 2007 and
2006), and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (2% during 2007 and 0% during 2006).

Consolidated
service and storage material sales revenues increased $207.8 million, or 20.3%, to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 and
$126.6 million, or 14.1%, to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase is
attributable to internal revenue growth (12% during 2007 and 7% during 2006), which was driven primarily by strong project revenue growth in North America and Europe, strong growth of recycled paper
revenues, and solid storage-related services revenue growth,
acquisitions (5% during 2007 and 7% during 2006), and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (3% during 2007 and 0% during 2006).


For
the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $379.7 million, or 16.2%, to $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 and
$272.2 million, or 13.1%, to $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Internal revenue
growth was 8%, 9% and 10% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations.
Acquisitions contributed 5%, 4% and 3% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations that impacted our revenues were 1% and were primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis
of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. For the year ended December 31, 2006, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were less than 1% and were
primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling and Euro, net of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates
for the comparable periods. For the year ended December 31, 2007, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were 3% and were primarily due to the strengthening of
the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods.

Our
internal revenue growth rate represents the weighted average year-over-year growth rate of our revenues after removing the effects of
acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the impact of the fire in one of our London, England facilities. Over the past eight quarters, the internal growth rate of our storage
revenues has decreased from the high end of our targeted range of 10% to 11% to the low end of our targeted range of 8% to 9%. Storage growth in our North American Physical Business remained within
our targeted range and we continued to benefit from a positive pricing environment. Storage growth in our U.K. business was slightly below our targeted range due primarily to increased levels of
destructions and permanent withdrawals. Strong growth rates in Latin America, Asia Pacific and in our digital services business further supported consolidated internal growth. Net carton volume growth
is a function of the rate at which new cartons are added by existing and new customers, offset by the rate of carton destructions and other permanent removals.

The
internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage revenue internal growth rate due to the more discretionary nature of
the services we offer, such as large special projects, data products and carton sales, and the price of recycled paper. These revenues are often event driven and impacted to a greater extent by
economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of these services as a way to reduce their short-term costs, and may often be difficult to replicate in future periods. As a
commodity, recycled paper prices are subject to the volatility of that market.

The
internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenues reflects the following: (1) growth in North American storage-related service revenues, increased special
project revenues and higher recycled paper revenues; (2) two large public sector contracts in Europe, one that was completed in the third quarter of 2007 and one that will be completed in 2008;
(3) continued growth in


our
secure shredding operations; and (4) a large data restoration project completed by our digital services business in the third quarter of 2005, which created a difficult comparable for the
third quarter of 2006 growth rate.

Labor

For the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, labor expense as a percentage of consolidated revenues
increased. This is mainly a result of our recent shredding and DMS acquisitions in Europe and Latin America, which have a higher service revenue component and are therefore more labor intensive,
offset by Asia Pacific labor decreasing as a
percentage of revenue, as that business begins to scale, as well as the impact of an increasing percentage of revenue from our digital business which requires significantly less direct labor as a
percentage of revenue compared to our larger physical businesses.

For
the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, labor expense as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased as a result of higher
labor costs resulting from our Australia/New Zealand acquisition and our shredding acquisitions in Europe, which have a higher service revenue component and are therefore more labor intensive. Our
digital business had higher costs of labor associated with internal information technology personnel and consultants dedicated to revenue producing projects.


Facilities

Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006,
remained unchanged at 13.7%. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which increased in dollar terms by $26.2 million while staying unchanged as a percentage of
consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in rent is mainly driven by the timing of new real estate, which may
include duplicative rent and the use of temporary space related to moving out of substandard facilities obtained through acquisitions. Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues was
also affected by increases in maintenance, property taxes and insurance, offset by decreases in utilities and security costs. The expansion of our secure shredding operations, which incurs lower
facilities costs than our core physical business, helps to lower our facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues.

Facilities
costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues increased to 13.7% for the year ended December 31, 2006 from 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The
increase in facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues was primarily a result of increases in utilities and maintenance costs, as well as, increased insurance deductibles and security
costs associated with protecting our assets, as a response to the fires in Ottawa, Canada and London, England. Rent expense decreased slightly as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a decrease in overall base rent per square foot in our North American operations when comparing 2005
to 2006. Rent expense increased in dollar terms by $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005.

Transportation

Our transportation expenses, which are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted
couriers, fuel expenses, maintenance and insurance, increased as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006.
The use of couriers and leased vehicles, rising gas prices, as well as shredding revenue growing at a faster rate than storage revenue, contributed to this increase.

Our
transportation expenses remained consistent as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005.
Higher fuel costs, increased maintenance expenses resulting from the accelerated implementation of a fleet-wide maintenance program in North America and vehicle leasing expenses were
primarily responsible for the dollar increase in transportation expenses.

Product Cost of Sales and Other

Product and other cost of sales, which includes cartons, media and other service and storage costs, are highly correlated to complementary revenue streams, and as
a result remained largely unchanged as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Product cost of sales for
the year ended December 31, 2007 were slightly higher in dollar terms compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 due to a corresponding increase in related carton, media and services
revenues. Product cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 due to a corresponding reduction in revenues.

General and Administrative

The slight decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the
year ended December 31, 2006 is mainly attributable to overhead leverage, which offset increased incentive compensation expense and start-up costs related to certain international
joint ventures.

The
increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31,
2005 is mainly attributable to (a) increased compensation expense due to expansion through acquisitions, (b) costs associated with our North American reorganization which added a new
level of field management, and (c) costs associated with a North American field operations meeting held in 2006 that was not held in 2005.

Sales, Marketing & Account Management

The majority of our sales, marketing and account management costs are labor related and are primarily driven by the headcount in each of these departments.
Compensation and commissions are the most significant components of sales, marketing and account management expenses. Our average sales force headcount increased during 2007 as compared to 2006. In
addition, we increased discretionary training and marketing during that period. Offsetting those increases in expenditures were changes to commission-based compensation plans, which resulted in lower
costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006.

Increased
headcount and related compensation and commissions are the most significant contributors to the increase in sales, marketing expenses and account management for the years ended


December 31,
2006 and 2005. Throughout the years ended December 31, 2005 and into 2006, we invested in the expansion and improvement of our sales, marketing and account management
functions. During 2006 in North America, while our sales force headcount increased at a slower rate than revenue growth, the shift to higher end resources drove an increase in the level of spending
due to higher costs per sales person and the additional support required. We have significantly increased the size of our digital sales force through our acquisition of LiveVault and the hiring of new
sales employees, particularly in Europe. Additionally, costs associated with an enterprise-wide sales meeting held in 2006 and not held in 2005 also contributed to this increase. Our
larger North American sales force generated a $6.3 million increase in sales commissions and an increase of $13.6 million of compensation expense for the year ended December 31,
2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005.

Information Technology

Information technology expenses decreased as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2006 primarily due to a write-off of $5.9 million of previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development
projects that were discontinued prior to being implemented in 2006 and did not repeat in 2007. The dollar increase in information technology expenses is due to compensation expense, consulting fees
and communication costs which are correlated to our increase in revenues.

Information
technology expenses increased as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 due to
increases in technology development activities within our digital services business, including the acquisition of LiveVault and associated research and development activities and increased spending to
support our growing digital
archiving business. Additionally, during 2006, we wrote-off $5.9 million of previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software
development projects that were discontinued prior to being implemented. Higher utilization of existing information technology resources to revenue producing projects, which are charged to costs of
goods sold and decreased information technology spending in our European operations, partially offset this increase.

Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) and Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $40.9 million to $249.3 million (9.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2007 from $208.4 million (8.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006. Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased
$21.5 million to $208.4 million (8.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $187.0 million (9.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2005. Depreciation expense increased $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, and increased
$17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to the additional depreciation expense related to recent capital
expenditures and acquisitions, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings, as well as accelerated
depreciation on buildings we have chosen to exit.

Amortization
expense increased $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, and increased $4.4 million for
the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets, such as customer relationship intangible assets and
intellectual property acquired through business combinations. We expect that amortization expense will continue to increase as we acquire new businesses and reflect the full year impact of our 2007
acquisitions.


Consolidated
gain on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted primarily of a gain related to
insurance proceeds from our property claim of $7.7 million associated with the July 2006 fire in one of our London, England facilities, net of a $1.3 million write-off of
previously deferred software costs in our North American Physical Business associated with a discontinued product after implementation. Consolidated gain on disposal/writedown of property, plant and
equipment, net of $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, consisted primarily of a gain on the sale of a property in the U.K. of $10.5 million offset by disposals and
writedowns. Consolidated gain on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, consisted primarily of a gain on the sale
of a property in the U.K. of $4.5 million offset primarily by software asset writedowns of $1.1 million.

OPERATING INCOME

As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $47.5 million, or 11.7%, to $454.7 million (16.7% of consolidated
revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $407.2 million (17.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006. Consolidated operating income increased
$20.4 million, or 5.3%, to $407.2 million (17.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $386.8 million (18.6% of consolidated revenues) for the
year ended December 31, 2005.

OIBDA

As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated OIBDA increased $88.5 million, or 14.4%, to $704.0 million (25.8% of consolidated revenues)
for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $615.6 million (26.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006. Consolidated OIBDA increased $41.9 million,
or 7.3%, to $615.6 million (26.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $573.7 million (27.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2005.

OTHER EXPENSES, NET

Interest Expense, Net

Consolidated interest expense, net increased $33.6 million to $228.6 million (8.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31,
2007 from $195.0 million (8.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 due to increased borrowings to fund acquisitions, offset by a decrease in our weighted
average interest rate from 7.5% as of December 31, 2006 to 7.4% as of December 31, 2007. In addition, as a result of the repayment of IME's revolving credit facility and term loans with
borrowings in the U.S., we had an increase of approximately $4.1 million in consolidated interest expense in the second quarter of 2007. This is a result of the difference in our calendar
reporting period and that of IME which is two months in arrears, and had no impact on cash flows.

Consolidated
interest expense, net increased $11.4 million to $195.0 million (8.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
$183.6 million (8.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005. The change is primarily due to increased borrowings to fund out 2005 and 2006 acquisitions,
particularly LiveVault and Pickfords Records Management ("Pickfords").

Foreign
currency transaction losses, net of $11.3 million based on period-end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to
the strengthening of the Euro and Canadian dollar, offset by the strengthening of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2006, as these currencies
relate to our intercompany balances with and between our Canadian and European subsidiaries, and British pounds sterling and Euro denominated debt held by our U.S. parent company.

Foreign
currency gains of $12.5 million based on period-end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to the strengthening
of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2005, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with our U.K. subsidiaries, borrowings
denominated in certain foreign currencies
under our revolving credit facility and British pounds sterling denominated debt held by our U.S. parent company.

Foreign
currency losses of $7.2 million based on period-end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to the weakening of
the British pound sterling and Euro, net of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2004, as these currencies relate to our intercompany
balances with and between our Canadian, U.K. and European subsidiaries, borrowings denominated in foreign currencies under our revolving credit facility and British pounds sterling denominated debt
held by our U.S. parent company.

Other,
net increased by $11.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 over the same period in 2006 primarily as a result of business interruption insurance proceeds of
$12.9 million pertaining to the July 2006 fire in one of our London, England facilities. During 2007, we wrote-off $5.7 million of deferred financing costs related to the
early extinguishment of U.S. and U.K. term loans and revolving credit facilities.

During
2006, we redeemed or purchased a portion of our outstanding 8

resulting in a charge of $2.8 million, which consists of tender premiums and transaction costs, deferred financing costs, as well as original issue discounts and premiums.


Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006, and 2007 were 41.4%, 41.8% and 30.9%, respectively. The primary reconciling items
between the statutory rate of 35% and our effective rate are state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and differences in the rates of tax to which our foreign earnings are subject. Our 2007
effective tax rate reflects the positive impact of our recent global treasury program of approximately 8.2%. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2007, our effective tax rate was
reduced by approximately 2.7% as a result of foreign currency gains and losses, which were incurred in different tax jurisdictions.

Our
effective tax rate is subject to future variability due to, among other items: (a) changes in the mix of income from foreign jurisdictions; (b) tax law changes;
(c) volatility in foreign exchange gains and (losses); and (d) the timing of the establishment and reversal of tax reserves. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and
numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax
authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as
appropriate. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates.

Minority Interest

Minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries, net resulted in a charge to income of $1.7 million (0.1% of consolidated revenues), $1.6 million
(0.1% of consolidated revenues) and $0.9 million (less than 0.1% of consolidated revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. This represents our
minority partners' share of earnings in our majority-owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results.

Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations" ("FIN 47"), an interpretation
of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS No. 143"). FIN 47 clarifies that conditional asset retirement obligations meet the definition of liabilities
and should be recognized when incurred if their fair values can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty surrounding the timing and method of settlement that may be conditional on events occurring in the
future are factored into the measurement of the liability rather than the existence of the liability. SFAS No. 143 established accounting and reporting standards for obligations associated with
the retirement of tangible long-lived assets legally required by law, regulatory rule or contractual agreement and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 requires
entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost by
increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset, which is then depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The liability is increased over time through income as
a component of depreciation expense, such that the liability will equate to the future cost to retire the long-lived asset at the expected retirement date. Upon settlement of the
liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. Our obligations are primarily the result of requirements under our facility lease
agreements which generally have "return to original condition" clauses which would require us to remove or restore items such as shred pits, vaults, demising walls and office build-outs,
among others. As of December 31, 2005, we have recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying FIN 47 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as prescribed in
FIN 47, which resulted in a gross charge of $4.4 million ($2.8 million, net of tax) in 2005.


NET INCOME

As a result of all the foregoing factors, for the year ended December 31, 2007, consolidated net income increased $24.2 million, or 18.8%, to
$153.1 million (5.6% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $128.9 million (5.5% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006. For the year ended
December 31, 2006, consolidated net income increased $17.8 million, or 16.0%, to $128.9 million (5.5% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $111.1 million (5.3% of
consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, revenue in our North American Physical Business segment increased 13.1%, primarily due to stable
storage internal growth rates, continued strength in special projects, higher recycled paper revenues, and acquisitions, primarily ArchivesOne, which contributed $32.0 million or approximately
2%. In addition, favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2007 in Canada resulted in increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of


0.6%
when compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased slightly in the year ended December 31, 2007 due mainly to increased
occupancy costs such as insurance and maintenance, and higher costs associated with the acquisition of new real estate and moving out of substandard facilities obtained through acquisitions, offset by
strong service revenue growth and overhead leverage.

During
the year ended December 31, 2006, revenue in our North American Physical Business segment increased 9.2% primarily due to increasing storage internal growth rates resulting
from stable net volume growth and an increasingly positive pricing environment, increasing service revenue growth rates particularly in data protection and fulfillment, growth of our secure shredding
operations, and acquisitions. In addition, favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2006 in Canada increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by
$9.8 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased in the year ended December 31, 2006 due mainly to
(a) higher transportation costs, primarily fuel and rental costs associated with a larger fleet of leased vehicles, and the accelerated implementation of a fleet-wide maintenance
program in North America, (b) increased facility costs, primarily utilities, maintenance and insurance, (c) increased investment in sales, marketing and account management primarily
related to a shift in hiring more experienced personnel at a higher cost, (d) costs associated with the North American reorganization, including a new level of field management, and
(e) costs associated with our enterprise-wide sales meeting and a field operations meeting, both held in 2006 but not in 2005.

Included
in our North American Physical Business segment are certain costs related to staff functions, including finance, human resources and information technology, which benefit the
enterprise as a whole. These costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are
then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. Management has decided to allocate these costs to the North American segment as further
allocation is impracticable.

Revenue in our International Physical Business segment increased 25.5% during the year ended December 31, 2007, due to internal growth of
12%, and acquisitions in Europe and Latin America. Further, favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily in Europe, resulted in increased revenue, as
measured in U.S. dollars, of approximately 10% compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased in the year ended December 31,
2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to the acquisition of lower-margin shredding and document management solutions businesses in Europe and Latin America,


the
impact of start-up costs in certain international joint ventures and the loss of gross margin associated with the July, 2006 fire in one of our London, England facilities. Offsetting
these decreases in contribution as a percent of segment revenue were higher-margin special projects, in particular two large public sector contracts in Europe, one that was completed in the third
quarter of 2007 and one that will be completed in 2008.

Revenue
in our International Physical Business segment increased 24.0% during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to acquisitions, which contributed
$92.0 million or 18.6%. This was partially offset by net unfavorable currency fluctuations in Europe and Latin America of $6.3 million or 1.5% during the year ended December 31,
2006. The balance of the increase in revenue represents internal growth. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased primarily due to the acquisition of two shredding businesses in the U.K.
that operate at lower margins, the acquisition of Pickfords, and costs associated with the fire in one of our London, England facilities.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, revenue in our Worldwide Digital Business segment increased 16.6%, due primarily to strong
internal growth of 14% and the acquisition of Stratify in December 2007. The increase is primarily attributable to growth in digital storage revenue from our online backup service offerings for both
personal computers and remote servers, and growth in storage of email archiving. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased due to the full benefit of the integration of the LiveVault
acquisition and the write-off of $5.9 million of previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were
discontinued prior to being implemented in 2006 and did not repeat in 2007, which offset the impact of increases in engineering headcount.

During
the year ended December 31, 2006, revenue in our Worldwide Digital Business segment increased 23.4% primarily due to internal growth of 16%, primarily attributable to
growth in digital storage revenue and our online backup service offerings for both personal computer and server data. The internal growth rate of our digital business was offset by a large data
restoration project in the third quarter of 2005, which was not repeated in 2006 but drove the increase in the digital storage growth rate beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005. The acquisition of
LiveVault in December 2005 contributed approximately $12 million in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2006. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased primarily due
to the acquisition of LiveVault, increased investment in the European sales force, increases in information technology costs, including the write-off of $5.9 million of previously
deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued, and the benefit of a large data


restoration
project in the third quarter of 2005. This decrease was offset by higher absorption of fixed costs as a result of increased revenues and a reduction in royalty payments.

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $484.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $374.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2006. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in operating income, including $12.9 million of business interruption insurance income related to the fire in one of our London, England
facilities, and non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, early extinguishment of debt, and foreign currency gains and losses, and the net change in
operating assets and liabilities, exclusive of acquisitions.

Due
to the nature of our businesses, we make significant capital expenditures and additions to customer acquisition costs. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to growth and
include investments in storage systems, information systems and discretionary investments in real estate. Cash paid for our capital expenditures and additions to customer acquisition costs during the
year ended December 31, 2007 amounted to $386.4 million and $16.4 million, respectively. From time to time and in the normal course of business we sell certain fixed assets,
primarily real estate. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we received $19.6 million of net proceeds from the sales of assets, including proceeds associated with our property claim from
our insurer related to the fire in one of our London, England facilities of $17.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, capital expenditures, net and additions to
customer acquisition costs were funded primarily with cash flows provided by operating activities. Excluding acquisitions, we expect our capital expenditures to be between $440 million and
$480 million in the year ending December 31, 2008. Included in our estimated capital expenditures for 2008 is $40 million to $50 million of opportunity driven real estate
purchases.

In
the year ended December 31, 2007, we paid net cash consideration of $481.5 million for acquisitions, most notably the ArchivesOne and RMS acquisitions in our
U.S. records and information management business and Stratify in our digital business. We also acquired a number of small records management and shredding businesses in North America and
Europe. Cash flows provided from operating activities, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, the proceeds from the sale of senior subordinated notes, and cash equivalents
on-hand funded these acquisitions.

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $457.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we had gross borrowings
under our revolving credit and term loan facilities and other debt of $2.3 billion, $435.8 million of proceeds from the sale of senior subordinated notes, $21.8 million of
proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan, $6.8 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and $2.5 million investment by a minority
partner in one of our joint ventures. We used the proceeds from these financing transactions to repay revolving credit and term loan facilities and other debt ($2.3 billion), to repay debt
financing from minority stockholders, net ($0.5 million), for payment of deferred financing costs of ($8.1 million) and to fund acquisitions.


We
are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2007 was comprised of the following (in

subsidiaries, are pledged to secure these debt instruments, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors.

Collectively
referred to as the Parent Notes. Iron Mountain Incorporated ("IMI") is the direct obligor on the Parent Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior
subordinated basis, by substantially all of its direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. Iron
Mountain Canada Corporation ("Canada Company") and the remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Parent Notes.

(3)

Canada
Company is the direct obligor on the Subsidiary Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by IMI and the Guarantors. These
guarantees are joint and several obligations of IMI and the Guarantors.

Our
revolving credit and term loan facilities, as well as our indentures, use earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") based calculations as primary
measures of financial performance, including leverage ratios. IMI's revolving credit and term leverage ratio was 4.4 and 4.5 as of December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively, compared to a
maximum allowable ratio of 5.5. Similarly, our bond leverage ratio, per the indentures, was 4.6 and 5.1 as of December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of
6.5. Noncompliance with these leverage ratios would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. Our bond leverage ratio decreased from 5.7 as of September 30, 2007
to 5.1 as of December 31, 2007 due to the designation as Excluded Restricted Subsidiaries, as defined in the indentures, of our subsidiaries that own our assets and conduct our operations in
the United Kingdom. As a result of such designation, these subsidiaries are now subject to substantially all of the covenants of the indentures, except that they are not required to provide a
guarantee, and the EBITDA of these subsidiaries is included for purposes of calculating the leverage ratio.

Our
ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic,
financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There


can
be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or
refinance our indebtedness, or to make necessary capital expenditures.

In
January 2007, we completed an underwritten public offering of 225 million Euro in aggregate principal amount of our 6


/


% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due
2018, which were issued at a price of 98.99% of par and priced to yield 6.875%. Our net proceeds were 219.2 million Euro ($289.1 million), after paying the underwriters' discounts and
commissions and estimated expenses (excluding accrued interest payable by purchasers of the notes from October 17, 2006). These net proceeds were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under
our old IMI term loan and revolving credit facilities.

In
March 2007, one of our Canadian subsidiaries, Iron Mountain Nova Scotia Funding Company, which was subsequently party to an amalgamation under which Canada Company was the continuing
company, issued, in a private placement, 175 million CAD in aggregate principal amount of the Subsidiary Notes, which were issued at par and subsequently exchanged for publicly registered notes
in the U.S., on July 27, 2007. The net proceeds of $146.8 million, after sales commissions, were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our old IMI term loan facility.

On
April 16, 2007, we entered into a new credit agreement (the "New Credit Agreement") to replace both the IMI revolving credit and term loan facilities of $750 million and
the IME revolving credit and term loan facilities of 200 million British pounds sterling. On November 9, 2007, we increased the aggregate amount available to be borrowed under the New
Credit Agreement from $900 million to $1.2 billion. The New Credit Agreement consists of revolving credit facilities where we can borrow, subject to certain limitations as defined in the
New Credit Agreement, up to an aggregate amount of $790 million (including Canadian dollar and multi-currency revolving credit facilities) (the "new revolving credit facility"), and a
$410 million term loan facility (the "new term loan facility"). Our subsidiaries, Canada Company and Iron Mountain Switzerland GmbH, may borrow directly under the Canadian revolving
credit and multi-currency revolving credit facilities, respectively. Additional subsidiary borrowers may be added under the multi-currency revolving credit facility. The new revolving credit facility
terminates on April 16, 2012. With respect to the new term loan facility, quarterly loan payments of approximately $1.0 million are required through maturity on April 16, 2014, at
which time the remaining outstanding principal balance of the new term loan facility is due. The interest rate on borrowings under the New Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest
rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin. IMI guarantees the obligations of each of the subsidiary borrowers under the New Credit Agreement, and substantially all of our
U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the obligations of IMI and the subsidiary borrowers. The capital stock or other equity interests of most of our U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the
capital stock or other equity interests of our first tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure the New Credit Agreement, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed
to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors. We recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of approximately $5.7 million in 2007 related to the early
retirement of the old IMI and IME revolving credit facilities and term loans, representing the write-off of deferred financing costs.

As
of December 31, 2007, we had $394.2 million of outstanding borrowings under the new revolving credit facility, of which $149.5 million was denominated in
U.S. dollars and the remaining balance was denominated in Canadian dollars (CAD 240.0 million); we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $34.5 million. The
remaining availability, based on IMI's leverage ratio, which is calculated based on the last 12 months' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, other adjustments as
defined in the New Credit Agreement and current external debt, under the new revolving credit facility on December 31, 2007, was $361.3 million. The interest rate in effect under the new
revolving credit facility and new term loan facility ranged from 6.8% to 8.3% and 6.2% to 7.1%, respectively, as of December 31, 2007.


The
New Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict
our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger.
Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the New Credit Agreement and our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness. We were in compliance with all
debt covenants in material agreements as of December 31, 2007.

In
the second quarter of 2007, we completed the acquisition of ArchivesOne, a leading provider of records and information management services in the United States. ArchivesOne has 31
facilities located in 17 major metropolitan markets in 10 states and the District of Columbia. The purchase price for ArchivesOne was $200.3 million. We funded this acquisition with cash and
cash equivalents on-hand and borrowings under the New Credit Agreement.

In
September 2007, we acquired RMS for $45.4 million in cash. RMS, a leading provider of outsourced file-room services, offers hospitals comprehensive, next generation
file-room and film-library management solutions.

In
December 2007, we acquired Stratify for $130.0 million in cash (net of cash acquired) and $22.8 million in fair value of options issued to augment our suite of
eDiscovery services, providing businesses with a complete, end-to-end eDiscovery solution. Stratify, a leader in advanced electronic discovery services for the legal market,
offers in-depth discovery and data investigation solutions for AmLaw 200 law firms and leading Fortune 500 corporations. Stratify is based in Mountain View, California. We funded this
acquisition with cash and cash equivalents on-hand and borrowings under the New Credit Agreement.

In
addition, in connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn-out obligations that may be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain
operational objectives. These payments are based on the future results of these operations, and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn-out payments we may be required to make under
all such agreements as of December 31, 2007 is approximately $24.3 million.


(3)

The
table above excludes $72.9 million in uncertain tax positions as we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the
respective taxing authorities.

We
expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, borrowings under the New Credit Agreement
and other financings, which may include secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. We expect to meet our long-term cash flow requirements using
the same means described above, as well as the potential issuance of debt or equity securities as we deem appropriate. See Note 4, 7, and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(a)(4)(ii).

Net Operating Loss, Alternative Minimum Tax and Foreign Tax Credit Carryforwards

We have federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2019 through 2022 of $78.9 million at December 31, 2007 to reduce future
federal taxable income, if any. We also have an asset for state net operating loss of $24.7 million (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to expire in 2008 through 2025, subject to a
valuation allowance of approximately 98%. Additionally, we have federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $11.8 million, which have no expiration date and are available to reduce
future income taxes, if any, and foreign tax credits of $56.1 million, which begin to expire in 2016.

Inflation

Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary
pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long-term real estate leases,
we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Interest Rate Risk

Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long term, fixed interest
rate debt to finance our business, thereby
helping to preserve our long term returns on invested capital. We target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we will use interest rate
swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. See Notes 3 and 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As
of December 31, 2007, we had $829.8 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 6.8%, and $2,436.5 million of
fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2007, 75% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%,
our net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 would have been reduced by $5.4 million. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this
Form 10-K for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2007.


Currency Risk

Our investments in IME, Canada Company, Iron Mountain Mexico, SA de RL de CV, Iron Mountain South America, Ltd., Iron Mountain Australia
Pty Ltd., Iron Mountain New Zealand Ltd. and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting
currency is the U.S. dollar. However, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the Euro, Canadian dollar and
British pound sterling. Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and
dollar-denominated liabilities to increase in local currency.

The
impact on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. We also have several
intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and IMI and our U.S.-based subsidiaries. In addition Iron Mountain Switzerland GmbH and our foreign subsidiaries and IME also have
intercompany obligations between them. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary.

We
have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. One strategy is to finance our largest international
subsidiaries with local debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. In determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies
among other factors. Another strategy we utilize is for IMI to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. Finally, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to
temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to lock in certain transaction economics. We have implemented these strategies for our four foreign investments in
the U.K., Continental Europe, Canada and Asia Pacific. Specifically, through our 150 million British pounds sterling denominated 7


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 and our
255 million 6


/


% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in British pounds sterling and Euros.
Canada Company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in Canadian dollars under the New Credit Agreement and its 175 million CAD denominated 7


/


% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2017. This creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. To fund the acquisition of Pickfords in Australia and New Zealand in December 2005, IMI borrowed Australian and New
Zealand dollars under its multi-currency revolving credit facility. These borrowings provided a natural hedge against the intercompany loans created at the time of the acquisition. Subsequently, we
repaid such borrowings under our multi-currency revolving credit facility and, contemporaneously in September 2006, we entered into forward contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for
55 million in Australian dollars ("AUD") and 20.2 million in New Zealand dollars ("NZD") to hedge our intercompany exposure in these countries. In addition, in January, 2007 we entered
into forward contracts to exchange 124.4 million U.S. dollars for 96 million Euros and 194 million CAD for 127.5 million Euros to hedge our intercompany exposures
with Canada and our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Euro. In March 2007, in conjunction with the issuance of CAD denominated senior subordinated notes, the CAD for Euro swap was not
renewed and was replaced with additional U.S. for Euro swaps. These forward contracts were not renewed in the third quarter of 2007. In the third quarter of 2007, we designated a portion of our


/


% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 issued by IMI as a hedge of net investment of certain of our Euro denominated subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded $6.1 million
($3.9 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange losses related to the "marking-to-market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of
accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in stockholder's equity for the year ended December 31, 2007. In May 2007, we entered into forward contracts to exchange 146.1 million
U.S. dollars for 73.6 million in British pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with IME. These forward contracts settle on a monthly basis, at which time we may enter into
new forward


contracts
for the same underlying amounts to continue to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward
contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. We have not designated these forward
contracts as hedges. We recorded a realized gain in connection with these forward contracts of $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. At the end of each month, we mark the
outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation. As of December 31, 2007, we recorded an
unrealized foreign exchange gain of $0.9 million in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations. As of December 31, 2007, except as noted above, our currency
exposures to intercompany balances are unhedged.

The
impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses.
Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect
of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items, net" component of stockholders' equity. A 10%
depreciation in year-end 2007 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction in our stockholders' equity of approximately $69.8 million.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The term "disclosure controls and procedures" is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Exchange Act"). These rules refer to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information is recorded, processed, summarized and communicated to
management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding what is required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it
files under the Exchange Act. As of December 31, 2007 (the "Evaluation Date"), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer
have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which is included herein.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Iron Mountain Incorporated

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Iron Mountain Incorporated and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2007 of the Company and our report dated February 29, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph
relating to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Iron Mountain Incorporated

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Iron Mountain Incorporated and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Iron Mountain Incorporated and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As
discussed in Note 7, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

, effective January 1, 2007.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 29, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2007

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

1. Nature of Business

On May 27, 2005, Iron Mountain Incorporated, a Pennsylvania corporation ("Iron Mountain PA"), reincorporated as a Delaware corporation. The reincorporation
was effected by means of a statutory merger (the "Merger") of Iron Mountain PA with and into Iron Mountain Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("Iron Mountain DE"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Iron
Mountain PA. In connection with the Merger, Iron Mountain DE succeeded to and assumed all of the assets and liabilities of Iron Mountain PA. Apart from the change in its state of incorporation, the
Merger had no effect on Iron Mountain PA's business, board composition, management, employees, fiscal year, assets or liabilities, or location of its facilities, and did not result in any relocation
of management or other employees. The Merger was approved at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 26, 2005. Upon consummation of the Merger, Iron Mountain DE succeeded to Iron
Mountain PA's reporting obligations and continued to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "IRM."

On
December 7, 2006, our board authorized and approved a three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a dividend on our common stock. We issued the
additional shares of common stock resulting from this stock dividend on December 29, 2006 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 18, 2006. All share data
has been adjusted for such stock split.

The
accompanying financial statements represent the consolidated accounts of Iron Mountain Incorporated, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. We are a global
full-service provider of information protection and storage and related services for all media in various locations throughout North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. We
have a diversified customer base comprised of commercial, legal, banking, health care, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 93% of the Fortune 1000
and more than 90% of the FTSE 100.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

a.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
accompanying financial statements reflect our financial position and results of operations on a consolidated basis. Financial position and results of operations of Iron Mountain
Europe Limited ("IME"), our European subsidiary, are consolidated for the appropriate periods based on its fiscal year ended October 31. All intercompany account balances have been eliminated
or presented to reflect the underlying economics of the transactions.

b.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates, judgments and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for
the period then ended. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the estimates used, including those related to accounting for acquisitions, allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos,
impairments of tangible and intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation and self-insured liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates,
current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the

carrying
values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

c.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on hand and cash invested in short-term securities which have remaining maturities at the date of purchase of less than 90 days.
Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

d.

Foreign
Currency

Local
currencies are considered the functional currencies for our operations outside the United States, with the exception of certain foreign holding companies, whose functional currency
is the U.S. dollar. All assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the applicable
period, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation." Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the accumulated other
comprehensive items component of stockholders' equity. The gain or loss on foreign currency transactions, calculated as the difference between the historical exchange rate and the exchange rate at the
applicable measurement date, including those related to (a) our 7

% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014, (b) our 6


/


% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes
due 2018, (c) the borrowings in certain foreign currencies under our revolving credit agreements, and (d) certain foreign currency denominated intercompany obligations of our foreign
subsidiaries to us and between our foreign subsidiaries, are included in other expense (income), net, on our consolidated statements of operations. The total of such net loss amounted to $7,201, a net
gain of $12,534, and a net loss of $11,311 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.

e.

Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

SFAS
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," requires that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a
liability measured at its fair value. Periodically, we acquire derivative instruments that are intended to hedge either cash flows or values which are subject to foreign exchange or other market price
risk, and not for trading purposes. We have formally documented our hedging relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management
objectives and strategies for undertaking each hedge transaction. Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use
long term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby preserving our long term returns on invested capital. We target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to
interest rates. Occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. In addition, we will use borrowings in foreign currencies, either obtained in
the U.S. or by our foreign subsidiaries, to
naturally hedge foreign currency risk associated with our international investments. Sometimes we enter into currency swaps to temporarily hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition,
while we arrange permanent financing or to hedge our exposures due to foreign currency exchange movements related to our intercompany accounts with and between our foreign subsidiaries.

Minor
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Major improvements which extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or the efficiency of property owned are
capitalized. Major improvements to leased buildings are capitalized as leasehold improvements and depreciated.

We
develop various software applications for internal use. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal
use computer software projects (to the extent of the time spent directly on the project) are capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use" ("SOP 98-1"). Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the
project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Capitalized software costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software beginning when the software is placed in
service. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we wrote-off $6,329 of previously deferred costs of our Worldwide Digital Business, primarily internal labor costs, associated with
internal use software development projects that were discontinued prior to being implemented, and such costs are included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations. During the year

ended
December 31, 2007, we wrote-off $1,263 of previously deferred software costs in our North American Physical Business, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal
use software development projects that were discontinued after implementation, which resulted in a loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net in the accompanying consolidated
statement of operations.

In
March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations" ("FIN 47"), an
interpretation of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS No. 143"). FIN 47 clarifies that conditional asset retirement obligations meet the definition
of liabilities and should be recognized when incurred if their fair values can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty surrounding the timing and method of settlement that may be conditional on events
occurring in the future are factored into the measurement of the liability rather than the existence of the liability. SFAS No. 143 established accounting and reporting standards for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets legally required by law, regulatory rule or contractual agreement and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS
No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity
capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset, which is then depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The liability is increased over
time through income such that the liability will equate to the future cost to retire the long-lived asset at the expected retirement date. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity
either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. Our obligations are primarily the result of requirements under our facility lease agreements which
generally have "return to original condition" clauses which would require us to remove or restore items such as shred pits, vaults, demising walls and office build-outs, among others. As
of December 31, 2005, we have recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying FIN 47 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as prescribed in FIN 47. The
impact of adopting FIN 47 as of December 31, 2005 was a gross charge of $4,422 ($2,751, net of tax), an increase in property, plant and equipment, net of $1,889 and long-term
liabilities of $6,311. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are the timing of removals, estimated cost and associated expected inflation rates that
are consistent with historical rates and credit-adjusted risk-free rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate.

A
reconciliation of liabilities for asset retirement obligations is as follows:

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

We
apply the provisions of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not
amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives are amortized over their
useful lives.

We
have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2005, 2006 and 2007 and noted
no impairment of goodwill. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and
market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2007, no factors were
identified that would alter this assessment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative
fair value. Our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2007 were as follows: North America (excluding Fulfillment), Fulfillment, U.K.,
Continental Europe, Worldwide Digital Business (excluding Iron Mountain Intellectual Property Management, Inc. ("IPM")), IPM, South America, Mexico and Asia Pacific.

Goodwill
valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions
including future growth rates, discount factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in
goodwill impairments in future periods.

Long-Lived
Assets

In
accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," we review long-lived assets and all amortizable
intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by
comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and
geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other
long-lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets.

Customer
Relationships and Acquisition Costs and Other Intangible Assets

Costs
related to the acquisition of large volume accounts, net of revenues received for the initial transfer of the records, are capitalized. Costs incurred to transport the boxes to one
of our facilities, which includes labor and transportation charges, are amortized over periods ranging from five to 30 years (weighted average of 25 years at December 31, 2007)
and are included in depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Payments to a customer's current records management vendor or direct payments to a customer
are amortized over approximately 5 years to the storage and service revenue line items in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. If the customer terminates its relationship
with us, the unamortized cost is charged to expense or revenue. However, in the event of such termination, we generally collect, and record as income, permanent removal fees that generally equal or
exceed the amount of the unamortized costs. Customer relationship intangible assets acquired through business combinations, which represents the majority of the balance, are amortized over periods
ranging from six to 30 years (weighted average of 22 years at December 31, 2007). Amounts allocated in purchase accounting to customer relationship intangible assets are
calculated based upon estimates of their fair value. As of December 31, 2006 and 2007, the gross carrying amount of customer relationships and acquisition costs was $339,591 and $557,192,
respectively, and accumulated amortization of those costs was $56,835 and $76,789, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, amortization expense was $12,910, $16,292
and $22,110, respectively, included in depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, the charge to
revenues associated with large volume accounts was $3,681 and $4,864, respectively, which represents the level anticipated over the next 5 years.

Other
intangible assets, including noncompetition agreements, acquired core technology and trademarks, are capitalized and amortized over a weighted average period of eight years. As of
December 31, 2006 and 2007, the gross carrying amount of other intangible assets was $32,985 and $50,004, respectively, and accumulated amortization of those costs was $9,521 and $13,183,
respectively, included in other in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, amortization expense was $3,314, $4,336

storage materials. Included in service and storage materials sales are related core service revenues arising from: (a) the handling of records including the addition of new records, temporary
removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, destruction of records, and permanent withdrawls from storage; (b) courier

operations,
consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (c) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (d) other recurring services including
maintenance and support contracts. Our complementary services revenues, included in service and storage material sales, arise from special project work, including data restoration, providing
fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales, including software licenses, specially designed storage containers, magnetic media including computer tapes and related supplies.

We
recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided and customers are generally
billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts, including maintenance and support contracts, for customers
where storage fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed.
Storage material sales are recognized when shipped to the customer and title has passed to the customer and include software license sales. Sales of software licenses to distributors are recognized at
the time a distributor reports that the software has been licensed to an end-user and all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.

Rent
Normalization

We
have entered into various leases for buildings. Certain leases have fixed escalation clauses or other features which require normalization of the rental expense over the life of the
lease resulting in deferred rent being reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we have assumed various above and below market leases in connection with certain of our
acquisitions. The difference between the present value of these lease obligations and the market rate at the date of the acquisition was recorded as a deferred rent liability or other
long-term asset and is being amortized over the remaining lives of the respective leases.

n.

Stock-Based
Compensation

We
adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation—Transition and Disclosure" in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003. We adopted SFAS No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment", effective January 1,
2006 using the modified prospective method. We record stock-based compensation expense, utilizing the straight-line method, for the cost of stock options, restricted stock and shares
issued under the employee stock purchase plan (together, "Employee Stock-Based Awards"). For the year ended December 31, 2006, the incremental stock-based compensation expense due to the
adoption of SFAS No. 123R caused income before provision for income taxes and minority interest to decrease by $894, and net income to decrease by $539, and had no impact on basic and diluted
earnings per share.

Stock-based
compensation expense, included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007 was $6,189 ($4,757 after
tax or $0.02 per basic and diluted share), $12,387 ($9,188 after tax or $0.05 per basic and diluted share) and

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

$13,861
($10,164 after tax or $0.05 per basic and diluted share), respectively, for Employee Stock-Based Awards.

SFAS
No. 123R requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow. This requirement
reduces reported operating cash flows and increases reported financing cash flows. As a result, net financing cash flows included $4,387 and $6,765 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
2007, respectively, from the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost. We used the short form method to calculate the Additional Paid-in Capital ("APIC") pool.
The tax benefit of any resulting excess tax deduction increases the APIC pool. Any resulting tax deficiency is deducted from the APIC pool.

The
following table details the effect on net income and earnings per share had stock-based compensation expense for the Employee Stock-Based Awards been recorded based on SFAS
No. 123R. The reported and pro forma net income and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007 in the table below are the same since stock-based compensation

Stock Options

Under our various stock option plans, options were granted with exercise prices equal to the market price of the stock at the date of grant. The majority of our
options become exercisable ratably over a
period of five years and generally have a contractual life of 10 years, unless the holder's employment is terminated. Beginning in 2007, certain of the options we issue become exercisable
ratably over a period of ten years and have a contractual life of 12 years, unless the holder's employment is terminated. As of December 31, 2007, 10-year vesting options
represent 11.8% of total outstanding options. Our Directors are considered employees under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We offer an employee stock purchase plan in which participation is available to substantially all U.S. and Canadian employees who meet certain service eligibility
requirements (the "ESPP"). The ESPP provides a way for our eligible employees to become stockholders on favorable terms. The ESPP provides for the purchase of our common stock by eligible employees
through successive offering periods. We generally have two 6-month offering periods, the first of which begins June 1 and ends November 30 and the second begins
December 1 and ends May 31. During each offering period, participating employees accumulate after-tax payroll contributions, up to a maximum of 15% of their compensation, to
pay the exercise price of their options. Participating employees may withdraw from an offering period before the purchase date and obtain a refund of the amounts withheld as payroll deductions. At the
end of the offering period, outstanding options are exercised, and each employee's accumulated contributions are used to purchase our common stock. Prior to the December 1, 2006 offering
period, the price for shares purchased under the ESPP was 85% of the fair market price at either the beginning or the end of the offering period, whichever was lower. Beginning with the
December 1, 2006 ESPP offering period, the price for shares purchased under the ESPP was changed to 95% of the fair market price at the end of the offering period, without a look back feature.
As a result, we no longer need to recognize compensation cost for our ESPP shares purchased beginning with the December 1, 2006 offering period and will, therefore, no longer have disclosure
relative to our weighted average assumptions associated with determining the fair value stock option expense in our

consolidated
financial statements on a prospective basis relative to offering periods after December 1, 2006. The ESPP was amended and approved by our stockholders on May 26, 2005 to
increase the number of shares from 1,687,500 to 3,487,500. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, there were 579,173, 535,826 and 274,881 shares, respectively, purchased under
the ESPP. The number of shares available for purchase at December 31, 2007 was 1,375,532.

The
fair value of the ESPP offerings was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table for the
respective periods. Expected volatility was calculated utilizing daily historical volatility over a period that equates to the expected life of the option. The risk-free interest rate was
based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected life equates to the 6-month offering period over which employees accumulate payroll deductions to
purchase our common stock. Expected dividend yield was not considered in the option pricing model since we do not pay dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future.

As
of December 31, 2007, unrecognized compensation cost related to the unvested portion of our Employee Stock-Based Awards was $73,759 and is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 5.2 years.

We
generally issue shares for the exercises of stock options, issuance of restricted stock and issuance of shares under our ESPP from unissued reserved shares.

Income
Taxes

We
account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS No. 109"), which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards. Valuation
allowances are provided when recovery of deferred tax assets is not considered more likely than not. We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"), an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, on January 1, 2007.

Income
Per Share—Basic and Diluted

In
accordance with SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share," basic net income per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. The

New
Accounting Pronouncements

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS No. 157"). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies
under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and
interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In February 2008,
the FASB delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2008.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 115" ("SFAS No. 159"). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141R"), and SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statement-an amendment to ARB No. 51" ("SFAS No. 160"). SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 160 will require (a) more
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date, (b) liabilities related to contingent consideration to be remeasured at fair value in
each subsequent period, (c) an acquirer to expense as incurred acquisition-related costs, such as

transaction
fees for attorneys, accountants and investment bankers, as well as, costs associated with restructuring the activities of the acquired company, and (d) noncontrolling interests in
subsidiaries initially to be measured at fair value and classified as a separate component of equity. SFAS No. 141R is effective and provided for prospective application for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 160 is required to apply retrospectively in comparative financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The
impact of SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 160 is dependent upon the level of future acquisitions; however, they will generally result in (1) increased operating costs associated with
the expensing of transaction and restructuring costs, as incurred, (2) increased volatility in earnings related to the fair valuing of contingent consideration through earnings in subsequent
periods, and (3) increased depreciation, amortization and equity balances associated with the fair valuing of noncontrolling interests and their classification as a separate component of
consolidated stockholders' equity.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memo Reserves

We
maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments and disputes
regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables and credit memo activity, current economic
conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. We consider accounts receivable to be delinquent after such time as reasonable means of collection have been exhausted. We
charge-off uncollectible balances as circumstances warrant, generally, no later than one year past due.

Certain Investments and Debt and Equity Securities." As of December 31, 2006 and 2007, the fair value of the money market and mutual funds included in this trust amounted to $7,414 and $7,659,
respectively, included in prepaid expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Included in other expense (income), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations
were net realized gains of $127, $336 and $961 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other

3. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We previously entered into two interest rate swap agreements, which were derivatives as defined by SFAS No. 133 and designated as cash flow hedges. These
swap agreements hedged interest rate risk on certain amounts of our term loan. Both of these swap agreements expired in the first quarter of 2006. As a result of the foregoing, for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2006, we recorded additional interest expense of $3,952 and $127 resulting from interest rate swap payments.

In
connection with certain real estate loans, we swapped $97,000 of floating rate debt to fixed rate debt. This swap agreement was terminated in the second quarter of 2007. The estimated
cost to terminate these swaps (fair value of derivative liability) was $760 at December 31, 2006, and is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The total impact of marking to
market the fair market value of the derivative liability and cash payments associated with the interest rate swap agreement resulted in our recording interest income of $1,698, $646 and $34 for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.

In
June 2006, IME entered into a floating for fixed interest rate swap contract with a notional value of 75,000 British pounds sterling and was designated as a cash flow hedge. This swap
agreement hedged interest rate risk on IME's British pounds multi-currency term loan facility. The notional value of the swap declined to 60,000 British pounds sterling in March 2007 to match the
remaining term loan amount outstanding as of that date and was terminated in the second quarter of 2007. We have recorded, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, the fair value of the
derivative liability, a deferred tax asset and a corresponding charge to accumulated other comprehensive items of $364 ($273 recorded in accrued expenses and $91 recorded in other
long-term liabilities), $109 and $255, respectively, as of December 31, 2006. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, we recorded additional interest expense of $124
and interest income of $799, respectively, resulting from interest rate swap cash settlements and changes in fair value.

In
September 2006, we entered into a forward contract program to exchange U.S. dollars for 55,000 in Australian dollars ("AUD") and 20,200 in New Zealand dollars ("NZD") to hedge our
intercompany exposure in these countries. These forward contracts settle on a monthly basis, at which time we enter into new forward contracts for the same underlying AUD and NZD amounts, to continue
to hedge movements in AUD and NZD against the U.S. dollar. At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other
expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. We have not designated these forward contracts as hedges. These forward contracts were
not renewed in the third quarter of 2007. We recorded a realized loss of $3,179 and $5,906 for the years
ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. At the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the
mark-to-market valuation. As of December 31, 2006, we recorded an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $303 in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement
of operations.

In
January 2007, we entered into forward contracts to exchange 124,368 U.S. dollars for 96,000 Euros and 194,000 Canadian dollars ("CAD") for 127,500 Euros to hedge our
intercompany exposures with Canada and our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Euro. In March 2007, in conjunction with the issuance of CAD denominated senior subordinated notes, the CAD for
Euro swap was not renewed and was replaced with additional U.S. for Euro swaps. These forward contracts were

investment of certain of our Euro denominated subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded $6,136 ($3,926, net of tax) of foreign exchange losses related to the mark to marking of such debt to currency
translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in stockholders' equity for the year ended December 31, 2007. In May 2007, we entered into
forward contracts to exchange 146,096 U.S. dollars for 73,600 in British pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with IME. These forward contracts settle on a monthly basis, at which time
we may enter into new forward contracts for the same underlying amounts to continue to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net
settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. We have
not designated these forward contracts as hedges. We recorded a realized gain in connection with these forward contracts of $8,045 for the year ended December 31, 2007. At the end of each
month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark-to-market valuation. As of December 31,
2007, we recorded an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $935 in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations.

Revolving
Credit Facility and Term Loans

On
April 16, 2007, we entered into a new credit agreement (the "New Credit Agreement") to replace both the IMI revolving credit and term loan facilities of $750,000 and the IME
revolving credit and term loan facilities of 200,000 British pounds sterling. On November 9, 2007, we increased the aggregate amount available to be borrowed under the New Credit Agreement from
$900,000 to $1,200,000. The New Credit Agreement consists of revolving credit facilities, where we can borrow, subject to certain limitations as defined in the New Credit Agreement, up to an aggregate
amount of $790,000 (including Canadian dollar and multi-currency revolving credit facilities) (the "new revolving credit facility"), and a $410,000 term loan facility (the "new term loan facility").
Our subsidiaries, Iron Mountain Canada Corporation ("Canada Company") and Iron Mountain Switzerland GmbH, may borrow directly under the Canadian revolving credit and multi-currency revolving
credit facilities, respectively. Additional subsidiary borrowers may be added under the multi-currency revolving credit facility. The new revolving credit facility terminates on April 16, 2012.
With respect to the new term loan facility, quarterly loan payments of approximately $1,000 are required through maturity on April 16, 2014, at which time the remaining outstanding principal
balance of the new term loan facility is due. The interest rate on borrowings under the New Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable
margin. IMI guarantees the obligations of each of the subsidiary borrowers under the New Credit Agreement, and substantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the obligations of IMI and the
subsidiary borrowers. The capital stock or other equity interests of most of our U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first tier foreign subsidiaries,
are pledged to secure the New Credit Agreement, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors. We recorded a charge to other
expense (income), net of approximately $5,703 in 2007 related to the early retirement of the IMI and IME revolving credit facilities and term loans, representing the write-off of deferred
financing costs. As of December 31, 2007, we had $394,156 of outstanding borrowings under the new revolving credit facility, of which $149,500 was denominated in U.S. dollars and the remaining
balance was denominated in CAD 240,000; we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $34,534. The remaining availability, based on IMI's leverage ratio, which is calculated based on the
last 12 months' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and

December 31, 2005 and 2006, we recorded commitment fees of $846 and $558, respectively, based on the unused balances under the old IMI revolving credit facility. For the year ended
December 31, 2007, we recorded commitment fees of $1,307 based on the unused balances under our revolving credit facility.

The
New Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict
our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger.
Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the New Credit Agreement and our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness. Our revolving credit and term loan
facilities, as well as our indentures, use EBITDA based calculations as primary measures of financial performance, including leverage ratios. IMI's revolving credit and term leverage ratio was 4.4 and
4.5 as of December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 5.5. Similarly, our
bond leverage ratio, per the indentures, was 4.6 and 5.1 as of December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5. Noncompliance with these leverage ratios
would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. We were in compliance with all debt covenants in material agreements as of December 31, 2007. Our bond leverage
ratio decreased from 5.7 as of September 30, 2007 to 5.1 as of December 31, 2007 due to the designation as Excluded Restricted Subsidiaries, as defined in the indentures, of our
subsidiaries that own our assets and conduct our operations in the United Kingdom. As a result of such designation, these subsidiaries are now subject to substantially all of the covenants of the
indentures, except that they are not required to provide a guarantee, and the EBITDA of these subsidiaries is included for purposes of calculating the leverage ratio.

The
Parent Notes and the Subsidiary Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by substantially all of our direct and indirect 100% owned U.S.
subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the senior subordinated notes. Additionally,
IMI guarantees the Subsidiary Notes. Canada Company does not guarantee the Parent Notes.

In
January 2007, we completed an underwritten public offering of 225,000 Euro in aggregate principal amount of our 6


/


% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018,
which were issued at a price of 98.99% of par. Our net proceeds were 219,200 Euro ($289,058), after paying the underwriters' discounts and commissions and estimated expenses (excluding accrued
interest payable by purchasers of the notes from October 17, 2006). These net proceeds were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the old IMI term loan and revolving credit facilities.

In
March 2007, one of our Canadian subsidiaries, Iron Mountain Nova Scotia Funding Company, which was subsequently party to an amalgamation under which Canada Company was the continuing
company, issued, in a private placement, 175,000 CAD in aggregate principal amount of the Subsidiary Notes, which were issued at par and subsequently exchanged for publicly registered notes in the
U.S., on July 27, 2007. The net proceeds of $146,760, after sales commissions, were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the old IMI term loan facility.

Each
of the indentures for the notes provides that we may redeem the outstanding notes, in whole or in part, upon satisfaction of certain terms and conditions. In any redemption, we are
also required to pay all accrued but unpaid interest on the outstanding notes.

The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness. As of
December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all debt covenants in material agreements.

c.

Real
Estate Mortgages

In
connection with the purchase of real estate and acquisitions, we assumed several mortgages on real property. The mortgages bear interest at rates ranging from 3.2% to 7.3% and are
payable in various installments through 2023.

d.

Seller
Notes

In
connection with the merger with Pierce Leahy in 2000, we assumed debt related to certain existing notes as a result of acquisitions which Pierce Leahy completed in 1999. The notes
bear interest at a rate of 4.75% per year. The outstanding balance of 4,170 British pounds sterling ($8,329) on these notes at December 31, 2007 is due on demand through 2009 and is classified
as a current portion of long-term debt.

DECEMBER 31, 2007

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

6. Acquisitions

The acquisitions we consummated in 2005, 2006 and 2007 were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the results of operations for
each acquisition have been included in our consolidated results from their respective acquisition dates. Cash consideration for the various acquisitions was primarily provided through borrowings under
our credit facilities, the proceeds from the sale of senior subordinated notes and cash equivalents on-hand. The unaudited pro forma results of operations for the period ended
December 31, 2006 and 2007 are not presented due to the insignificant impact of the 2006 and 2007 acquisitions on our consolidated results of operations, respectively. Noteworthy acquisitions
are as follows:

To
develop our presence in Asia Pacific, in December 2005, we acquired the Australian and New Zealand operations of Pickfords Records Management for total cash consideration of
approximately Australian Dollar 115,000 ($86,276, net of cash acquired).

To
extend our leadership role in the protection of our customer' business data, in December 2005, we acquired full ownership of LiveVault Corporation ("LiveVault") for cash consideration
of $35,798 (net of cash acquired). As of December 31, 2004, we had a minority interest investment in LiveVault with a carrying value of $3,615. LiveVault is a provider of disk-based
online server backup and recovery solutions.

To
extend our leadership role in the information protection and storage services industry, in May 2007, we acquired ArchivesOne, Inc. ("ArchivesOne"), a leading provider of
records and information management services in the United States. ArchivesOne has 31 facilities located in 17 major metropolitan markets in 10 states and the District of Columbia. The purchase price
was $200,295 (net of cash acquired) for ArchivesOne.

To
complement our current health information solutions, in September 2007, we acquired RMS Services—USA, Inc. ("RMS") for $45,400 in cash. RMS, a leading provider of
outsourced file-room services, offers hospitals comprehensive, next generation file-room and film-library management solutions.

In
December 2007, we acquired Stratify, Inc. ("Stratify") for $130,051 in cash (net of cash acquired) and $22,828 in fair value of options issued (based on the Black-Scholes
option pricing model) to augment our suite of eDiscovery services, providing businesses with a complete, end-to-end Discovery Services solution. Stratify, a leader in advanced
electronic discovery services for the legal market, offers in-depth discovery and data investigation solutions for AmLaw 200 law firms and leading Fortune 500 corporations. Stratify is
based in Mountain View, California.

respectively, related to acquisitions made in previous years.

Consisted
primarily of land, buildings, racking, and leasehold improvements.

(3)

The
weighted average lives of customer relationship assets associated with acquisitions in 2005, 2006 and 2007 were 24 years, 18 years, and 24 years,
respectively.

(4)

Consisted
primarily of accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable.

(5)

Consisted
primarily of the carrying value of minority interests of Latin American partners at the date of acquisition in 2005 and the carrying value of minority interests of European,
Latin American and Asia Pacific partners at the date of acquisition in 2006.

Allocation
of the purchase price for the 2007 acquisitions was based on estimates of the fair value of net assets acquired, and is subject to adjustment. The purchase price allocations
of certain 2007 transactions are subject to finalization of the assessment of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets (primarily customer relationship assets), operating
leases, restructuring purchase reserves, deferred revenue and deferred income taxes. We are not aware of any information that would indicate that the final purchase price allocations will differ
meaningfully from preliminary estimates.

In
connection with each of our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses. The restructuring activities include certain reductions in staffing
levels, elimination

6. Acquisitions (Continued)

of
duplicate facilities and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the acquired businesses. The estimated cost of these restructuring activities were recorded as costs of the
acquisitions and were provided in accordance with EITF No. 95-3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination." We finalize restructuring plans for
each business no later than one year from the date of acquisition. Unresolved matters at December 31, 2007 primarily include completion of planned abandonments of facilities and severance
contracts in connection with certain acquisitions.

The
following is a summary of reserves related to such restructuring activities:

At
December 31, 2006, the restructuring reserves related to acquisitions consisted of lease losses on abandoned facilities ($3,010), severance costs ($259) and other exit costs
($2,284). At December 31, 2007, the restructuring reserves related to acquisitions consisted of lease losses on abandoned facilities ($2,018), severance costs ($407) and other exit costs
($1,177). These accruals are expected to be used prior to December 31, 2008 except for lease losses of $1,523, severance contracts of $94, and other exit costs of $128, all of which are based
on contracts that extend beyond one year.

connection with our acquisition in India, we entered into a shareholder agreement in May 2006. The agreement contains a put provision that would allow the minority stockholder to sell
the remaining 49.9% equity interest to us beginning on the third anniversary of this agreement for the greater of fair market value or approximately 84,835 Rupees (approximately $2,200). In accordance
with FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others—An Interpretation of
FASB Statements
No. 5, 57 and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34," we recorded a liability representing our estimate of the fair value of the guarantee in the amount of $427.

In
connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn-out obligations that would be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain operational
objectives. These payments are based on the future results of these operations and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn-out payments we may be required to make under all such
agreements as of December 31, 2007 is approximately $24,300.

7. Income Taxes

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company's financial statements in
accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return.

The
evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a two-step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby the company determines whether it is
more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The
second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial
statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

The
provisions of FIN 48 are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of this standard. Only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold
at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of FIN 48. The cumulative effect of applying
the provisions of FIN 48 should be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year.

We
adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 and, as a result, we recognized a $16,606 increase in the reserve related to uncertain tax positions, which was
accounted for as a reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. Additionally, we grossed-up deferred tax assets and the reserve related to uncertain tax positions
in the amount of $7,905 related to the federal tax benefit associated with certain state reserves. As of January 1, 2007, our reserve related to uncertain tax positions, which is included in
other long-term liabilities, amounted to $83,958. Of this amount, approximately $35,439, if settled favorably, would reduce our recorded goodwill balance, with the remainder being
recognized as a reduction of income tax expense.

We
have elected to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements
of operations. We recorded $226, $857 and $1,170 for interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.

We
have $4,263 and $3,630 accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007, respectively.

A
summary of tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions is as follows:

Our
Canadian business operates primarily as a US branch and is included in the US income for tax purposes. The amount of Canadian income before provision for income taxes included is
$24,321, $26,816, and $22,100 for 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.

We
have federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2019 through 2022 of $78,909 at December 31, 2007 to reduce future federal taxable income, if any. We
also have an asset for state net operating loss of $24,742 (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to expire in 2008 through 2025, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 98%.
Additionally, we have federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $11,764, which have no expiration date and are available to reduce future income taxes, if any, and foreign tax credits of
$56,125, which begin to expire in 2016.

We
are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments
by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $72,908 of reserves related to uncertain tax positions included in other
long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Approximately $27,001 of the reserve is related to pre-acquisition net operating loss carryforwards and
other acquisition related items. If the tax position is sustained, the reversal of this reserve will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the
final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in our estimates.

A

We
have not provided deferred taxes on book basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future
and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis differences could be
reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries as well as certain other events or actions on our part, which would result in an increase in our provision for
income taxes. It is not practicable to calculate the amount of such basis differences.

9. Segment Information (Continued)

The
accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 2 except that certain corporate and centrally controlled costs are allocated primarily
to our North American Physical Business and Worldwide Digital Business segments. These allocations, which include human resources, information technology, finance, rent, real estate property taxes,
medical costs, incentive compensation, stock option expense, worker's compensation, 401(k) match contributions and property, general liability, auto and other insurance, are based on rates and
methodologies established at the beginning of each year. Included in the corporate costs allocated to our North American Physical Business segment are certain costs related to staff functions,
including finance, human resources and information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. These costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate
level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. Management has
decided to allocate these costs to the North American Physical Business segment as further allocation is impracticable.

Contribution
for each segment is defined as total revenues less cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) and selling, general and administrative expenses (including the
costs allocated to each segment as described above). Internally, we use Contribution as the basis for evaluating the performance of and allocating resources to our operating segments.

a.

Leases

Most
of our leased facilities are leased under various operating leases. A majority of these leases have renewal options of five to ten years and may have fixed or Consumer Price Index
escalation clauses. We also lease equipment under operating leases, primarily computers which have an average lease life of three years. Trucks and office equipment are also leased and have remaining
lease lives ranging from one to seven years. Total rent expense (including common area maintenance charges) under all of our operating leases was $185,542, $207,760 and $240,833 for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Included in total rent expense was sublease income of $3,238, $3,740 and $4,973 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007,
respectively.

as of December 31, 2007 was $77,811. Such amount does not take into consideration the recovery or resale value associated with these vehicles. We believe that it is not reasonably likely that
we will be required to perform under these guarantee agreements or that any performance requirement would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
addition, we have certain contractual obligations which require minimum payments of $20,647, $10,913, $8,895, $2,857, $496 and $145 in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and thereafter,
respectively.

b.

Litigation

On
September 19, 2007, back-up media belonging to one of our customers, the Louisiana Office of Student Financial Assistance ("LOSFA"), was lost while being
transported to the customer's office. We immediately undertook and continue to engage in efforts to locate the media and we promptly notified LOSFA and appropriate law enforcement authorities;
however, to date, the media has not been found. Beginning on October 15, 2007, LOSFA issued one or more press releases and other public communications advising of the loss, indicating that
personally identifiable information was on the media and advising persons who might be affected as to how to protect themselves against possible identity theft and fraud. LOSFA has demanded that we
indemnify it in connection with any losses arising from the lost media. In late October 2007 and early November 2007, actions seeking to represent a purported class of allegedly affected individuals
were filed in state courts in West Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in the 18th Judicial District for the Parish of West Baton Rouge (West Baton Rouge), in New Orleans, Louisiana, in the Civil District
Court for the Parish of Orleans (New Orleans), and in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana (Eastern District of Louisiana). These actions seek monetary damages under
various theories of liability as a result of the lost media. We removed the first of those actions (West Baton Rouge) to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana where,
subsequently, it was voluntarily dismissed. We removed the second action (New Orleans) to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, where it was consolidated with the
third such action (Eastern District of Louisiana). We have formally answered the complaints in these two remaining actions, denying liability and asserting various affirmative defenses. We have also
notified our insurers and intend to continue to defend these

cases
vigorously. As of December 31, 2007, we have not provided any loss reserves associated with these matters.

We
are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business with a portion of the defense and/or settlement costs being covered by various commercial liability
insurance policies purchased by us. In the opinion of management, no material legal proceedings are pending to which we, or any of our properties, are subject. We record legal costs associated with
loss contingencies as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.

London
Fire

In
July 2006, we experienced a significant fire in a leased records and information management facility in London, England that resulted in the complete destruction of the facility and
its content. The London Fire Brigade issued a report in which it was concluded that the fire resulted from human agency, i.e., arson, and its report to the Home Office concluded that the fire
resulted from a deliberate act. The London Fire Brigade also concluded that the installed sprinkler system failed to control the fire due to the primary fire pump being disabled prior to the fire and
the standby fire pump being disabled in the early stages of the fire by third-party contractors. We have received notices of claims from customers or their subrogated insurance carriers under various
theories of liabilities arising out of lost data and/or records as a result of the fire. We deny any liability in respect of the London fire and we have referred these claims to our primary warehouse
legal liability insurer for an appropriate response. Certain of the claims have also been settled for nominal amounts, typically one to two British pounds sterling per carton, as specified in the
contracts, which amounts have been or will be reimbursed to us from our primary property insurer. On or about April 12, 2007, a firm of British solicitors representing 31 customers and/or their
subrogated insurers has filed a Claim Form in the (U.K.) High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, seeking unspecified damages in excess of 15 British pounds sterling on account of the records
belonging to those customers that were destroyed in the fire. We have also been informed that, on or about April 20, 2007, another firm of British solicitors representing 21 customers and/or
their subrogated insurer also filed a Claim Form in the same court seeking provisional damages of approximately 15,000 British pounds sterling on account of the records belonging to those customers
that were destroyed in the fire. Both of those matters are being held in abeyance by agreement between the claimants and the solicitors appointed by our primary warehouse legal liability carrier and
some of them have been settled for nominal amounts. However, many of these claims, including larger ones, remain outstanding. On or about October 17, 2007, our primary warehouse legal liability
carrier, in the name of our subsidiary Iron Mountain (U.K.) Limited, filed a Claim Form with the (U.K.) High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, Commercial Court, against The Virgin Drinks Group
Limited, a customer who had records destroyed in the fire, seeking a declaration to the effect that our liability to that customer is limited to a maximum of one British pound sterling per carton of
lost records and, in any event, to a maximum of 500 British pound sterling in the aggregate, in accordance with the parties' contract. Detailed Particulars of Claim in respect of that matter were
filed and served on January 18, 2008. Finally, we have recently been served with a counterclaim for 5 British pounds sterling by Sucre Export London Ltd., a customer which lost records
in the fire, in connection with a U.K. Small Claims Court action in which we are seeking approximately 3.5 British pounds sterling in unpaid charges that are not disputed by the customer. We have

that
matter as well to our primary warehouse legal liability insurer for a formal response. We deny any liability to Sucre Export London Ltd. in respect of its Small Claims Court counterclaim.

We
believe we carry adequate property and liability insurance. We do not expect that this event will have a material impact to our consolidated results of operations or financial
condition. Revenues from this facility represented less than 1% of our consolidated enterprise revenues. As of December 31, 2006 and 2007, we had approximately $9,600 and $0, respectively,
recorded as an insurance receivable which is included in prepaid expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. This represents primarily the net book value of the property, plant
and equipment associated with this facility at the time of the incident and paid customer claims, net of $1,750 and $17,755 of property insurance proceeds received through IME's October 31
fiscal year end of 2006 and 2007, respectively. We recorded approximately $12,927 to other expense (income), net for the year ended December 31, 2007 related to recoveries associated with
settlement of the business interruption portion of our
insurance claim. We have received recoveries related to our property claim with our insurance carriers that exceed the carrying value of such assets. We have recorded a gain on the disposal of
property, plant and equipment of $7,745 for the year ended December 31, 2007. We will utilize cash received from our insurance carriers to fund capital expenditures and for general working
capital needs. Recoveries from the insurance carriers related to business personal property claims are reflected in our statement of cash flows under proceeds from sales of property and equipment and
other, net included in investing activities section when received. Recoveries from the insurance carriers related to business interruption claims are reflected in our statement of cash flows as a
component of net income included in the operating activities section when received.

11. Related Party Transactions

We lease space to an affiliated company, Schooner Capital LLC ("Schooner"), for its corporate headquarters located in Boston, Massachusetts. For the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, Schooner paid rent to us totaling $161, $167 and $168, respectively. We lease facilities from an officer in the U.S. Our aggregate rental payment for
such facilities during 2005, 2006 and 2007 was $978, $1,113 and $1,048, respectively.

We
have an agreement with Leo W. Pierce, Sr., our former Chairman Emeritus and the father of J. Peter Pierce, our former director, that requires pension payments of $8 per month until
his death. The estimated remaining benefit is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in the amount of $538 as of December 31, 2007.

In
December 2005, IME made a $2,860 investment in a Polish joint venture in which one of our directors has an indirect 20% interest.

12. 401(k) Plans

We have a defined contribution plan, which generally covers all non-union U.S. employees meeting certain service requirements. Eligible employees may
elect to defer from 1% to 25% of compensation per pay period up to the amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, IME operates a defined contribution plan, which is similar to the
U.S.'s 401(k) Plan. We make matching contributions based on the amount of an employee's contribution in accordance with the plan documents. We have expensed $6,737, $9,997 and $11,619 for the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.
