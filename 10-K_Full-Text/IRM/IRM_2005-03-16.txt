A. Development of Business.

We are the leader in information storage and protection services. We are an international, full-service provider of information storage and protection
and related services, enabling customers to outsource these functions. We have a diversified customer base comprised of numerous commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance,
entertainment, and government organizations, including more than 95% of the Fortune 1000 and more than two-thirds of the FTSE 100. Our comprehensive solutions help customers save money and manage
risks associated with legal and regulatory compliance, protection of vital assets, and business continuity challenges.

Our
core records management services include: records management program development and implementation based on best-practices to help customers comply with specific
regulatory requirements; implementation of policy-based programs that feature secure, cost-effective storage for all major media, including paper, which is the dominant form of records
storage, flexible retrieval access and retention management; digital archiving services for secure, legally compliant and cost-effective long-term archiving of electronic
records; secure shredding services that ensure privacy and a secure chain of record custody; and specialized services for vital records, film and sound and regulated industries such as healthcare,
energy and financial services.

Our
data protection services include: disaster preparedness planning support; secure, off-site vaulting of data backup media for fast and efficient data recovery in the event
of
a disaster, human error or virus; electronic vaulting to provide managed, online data backup and recovery services for personal computers and server data; and intellectual property management services
consisting of escrow services to protect and manage source code and other proprietary information with a trusted, neutral third party and domain name management services.

In
addition to our core records management and data protection services, we sell storage materials, including cardboard boxes and magnetic media, and provide consulting, facilities
management, fulfillment and other outsourcing services.

Iron
Mountain was founded in 1951 in an underground facility near Hudson, New York. Now in our 54

th

year, we have experienced tremendous growth and organizational change,
particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in February 1996. Since then, we have built ourselves from a regional business with limited product
offerings and annual revenues of $104 million in 1995 into the leader in information storage and protection services, providing a full range of services to customers in markets around the
world. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we had total revenues of $1.8 billion.

Our
growth since 1995 has been accomplished primarily through the acquisition of U.S. and international information storage and protection services companies. The goal of our current
acquisition program is to supplement internal growth by continuing to establish a footprint in targeted international markets and adding fold-in acquisitions both in the U.S. and
internationally. Having substantially completed our North American geographic expansion by the end of 2000, we shifted our focus from growth through acquisitions to internal revenue growth. In 2001,
as a result of this shift, internal revenue growth exceeded growth through acquisitions for the first time since we began our acquisition program in 1996. This was also the case in 2002 and 2003. In
2004, revenue growth from acquisitions exceeded internal revenue growth due primarily to the acquisition of the records management operations of Hays plc ("Hays IMS") in July 2003. In the absence of
unusual acquisition activity, we expect to achieve most of our revenue growth internally in 2005 and beyond. We expect to achieve our internal revenue growth through a sophisticated sales and account
management coverage model that is designed to drive incremental revenue by acquiring new customer relationships, increasing the revenue generated by existing customer relationships and by effectively
selling a wide range of


records
management and data protection services to expand our new and existing customer relationships.

In
February 2004, we completed the acquisition of the 49.9% equity interest held by Mentmore plc ("Mentmore") in Iron Mountain Europe Limited ("IME"), our European joint venture,
for total consideration of 82.5 million British pounds sterling ($154 million) in cash. Included in this amount is the repayment of all trade and working capital funding owed to Mentmore
by IME. Completion of the transaction gave us 100% ownership of IME, affording us full access to all future cash flows and greater strategic and financial flexibility.

In
November 2004, we acquired Connected Corporation ("Connected") for total cash consideration of $109 million (net of cash acquired). Connected is the technology and
market leader in the protection, archiving and recovery of distributed data. Our acquisition of Connected builds on our mission to protect our customers' information and protect our customers through
compliant records management.

As
of December 31, 2004, we provided services to over 235,000 customer accounts in 85 markets in the U.S. and 63 markets outside of the U.S., employed over 14,500 people and
operated approximately 830 records management facilities in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Latin America.

B. Description of Business.

The Information Storage and Protection Services Industry

Overview

Companies in the information storage and protection services industry store and manage information in a variety of media formats, which can broadly be divided
into physical and electronic records, and provide a wide range of services related to the records stored. We refer to our general physical records storage and management services as records
management. We define physical records to include paper documents, as well as all other non-electronic media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film,
X-rays and blueprints. Electronic records include various forms of magnetic media such as computer tapes and hard drives and optical disks. We include in our electronic records storage and
management services (1) data protection and (2) digital archiving services.

Physical Records

Physical records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. Active records relate to ongoing and recently completed activities or contain
information that is frequently referenced. Active records are usually stored and managed on-site by the organization that originated them to ensure ready availability. Inactive physical
records are the principal focus of the information storage and protection services industry. Inactive records consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be
retained for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. A large and growing specialty subset of the physical records market is
medical records. These are active and semi-active records that are often stored off-site with and serviced by a information storage and protection services vendor. Special
regulatory requirements often apply to medical records.

Electronic Records

Electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of recently processed data or
archival in nature. Customer needs for data backup and recovery and archiving are distinctively different. Backup data exists because of the need of many businesses to maintain backup copies of their
data in order to be able to recover the data in the event of a system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. It is customary (and a best


practice)
for data processing groups to rotate backup tapes to off-site locations on a regular basis and to require multiple copies of such information at multiple sites.

In
addition to the physical rotation and storage of backup data, we offer electronic vaulting services as an alternative way for businesses to transfer data to us, and to access the data
they have stored with us. Electronic vaulting is a Web-based service that automatically backs up computer data over the Internet and stores it off site in one of our secure data centers.
In early 2003, we announced an expansion of the electronic vaulting service to include backup and recovery for personal computer data, answering customers' needs to protect critical business data,
which is often unprotected on employee laptops and desktop personal computers. In November 2004, we acquired Connected, the market leader in the backup and recovery of this distributed data. We
refer to the physical rotation and storage of backup data and electronic vaulting as data protection services.

There
is a growing need for better ways of archiving data for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons and for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations.
Historically, businesses have relied on backup tapes for storing archived data in electronic format, but this process can be costly and ineffective when attempting to search and retrieve the data for
litigation or other needs. In addition,
many industries, such as healthcare and financial services, are facing increased governmental regulation mandating the way in which electronic records are stored and managed. To help customers meet
these growing storage challenges, we introduced digital archiving services. We have experienced early market adoption of these services, especially for e-mail archiving, which enables
businesses to identify and retrieve electronic records quickly and cost-effectively, while maintaining regulatory compliance.

Growth of Market

We believe that the volume of stored physical and electronic records will continue to increase for a number of reasons, including: (1) the rapid growth of
inexpensive document producing technologies such as facsimile, desktop publishing software and desktop printing; (2) the continued proliferation of data processing technologies such as personal
computers and networks; (3) regulatory requirements; (4) concerns over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of documentation;
(5) the high cost of reviewing records and deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and
(7) audit requirements to keep backup copies of certain records in off-site locations.

We
believe that paper-based information will continue to grow, not in spite of, but because of, new "paperless" technologies such as e-mail and the Internet. These
technologies have prompted the creation of hard copies of such electronic information and have also led to increased demand for electronic records services, such as the storage and
off-site rotation of backup copies of magnetic media. In addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital information technologies and distributed data networks has created an
emerging need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality solutions for digital archiving and the management of electronic documents.

Consolidation of a Highly Fragmented Industry

There was significant consolidation within the highly fragmented information storage and protection services industry in North America from 1995 to 2000 and at a
slower but continuing pace in recent years. Most information storage and protection services companies serve a single local market, and are often either owner-operated or ancillary to another
business, such as a moving and storage company. We believe that the consolidation trend, both in North America and other regions, will continue because of the industry's capital requirements for
growth, opportunities for large information storage and protection services providers to achieve economies of scale and customer demands for more sophisticated technology-based solutions.


We
believe that the consolidation trend in the industry is also due to, and will continue as a result of, the preference of certain large organizations to contract with one vendor in
multiple cities and countries for multiple services. In particular, customers increasingly demand a single, large, sophisticated company to handle all of their important physical and electronic
records needs. Large national and multinational companies are better able to satisfy these demands than smaller competitors. We have made, and intend to continue to make, acquisitions of our
competitors, many of whom are small, single-city operators.

Description of Our Business

We generate our revenues by providing storage for a variety of information media formats, core records management services and an expanding menu of complementary
products and services to a large and diverse customer base. Providing outsourced storage for records and information is the mainstay of our customer relationships and provides the foundation for our
revenue growth. The core services, which are a vital part of a comprehensive records management program, are highly recurring in nature and therefore very predictable. Core services consist primarily
of the handling and transportation of stored records and information. In our secure shredding business, core services consist primarily of the scheduled collection and handling of sensitive records.
In 2004, our storage and core service revenues represented approximately 86% of our total revenues. In addition to our core services, we offer a wide array of complementary products and services such
as performing special project work, selling records management services related products, providing fulfillment services and consulting on records management issues. These services address more
specific needs and are designed to enhance our customers' overall records management programs. These services complement our core services; however, they are more episodic and discretionary in nature.
Revenue generated by our business records and data protection businesses includes both core and complementary components.

Our
various operating segments offer the products and services discussed below. In general, our business records management segment offers records management, secure shredding,
healthcare information services, vital records services, and service and courier operations in the U.S. and Canada. Our data protection segment offers data backup and disaster recovery services, vital
records services, service and courier operations, and intellectual property management services in the U.S. Our international segment offers elements of all our product and services lines outside the
U.S. and Canada. Our corporate and other segment includes our fulfillment, consulting and digital archiving services. Some of our complementary services and products are offered within all of our
segments. The amount of revenues derived from our business records management, data protection, international, and corporate and other operating segments and other relevant data, including financial
information about geographic areas, for fiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004 are set forth in Note 12 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business Records Management

The hard copy business records stored by our customers with us by their nature are not very active. These types of records are stored in cartons packed by the
customer. We use a proprietary order processing and inventory management system known as the

SafekeeperPLUS

® system to efficiently store and
later retrieve a customer's cartons. Storage charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis, usually either per carton or per cubic foot of records, and include the provision of
space, racking, computerized inventory and activity tracking and physical security.

Data Protection

Data protection services consist of the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery and business continuity plans.
Computer tapes, cartridges and disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where they are available to
customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to facilitate data


recovery
in the event of a disaster. We use various proprietary information technology systems such as

MediaLink

™ and

SecureBase

™ software to manage this
process. We also manage tape library relocations and support disaster recovery testing and execution. In
addition, we offer electronic vaulting services as part of our data protection services product line. Our electronic vaulting service automatically backs up personal computer and server data over the
Internet and stores it off site in one of our secure data centers, always available in the event of a disaster.

Healthcare Information Services

Healthcare information services principally include the handling, storage, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records used by hospitals, private
practitioners and other medical institutions. Medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide easier access to individual
files. Healthcare information services also include recurring project work and ancillary services. Recurring project work involves the on-site removal of aged patient files and related
computerized file indexing. Ancillary healthcare information services include release of information (medical record copying), temporary staffing, contract coding, facilities management and imaging.

Vital Records Services

Vital records contain critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film and other highly proprietary information. Vital records may
require special facilities or services, either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. Our charges for providing enhanced security and special climate-controlled
environments for vital records are higher than for typical storage functions. We provide the same ancillary services for vital records as we provide for our other storage operations.

Service and Courier Operations

Service and courier operations are an integral part of a comprehensive records management program for all physical media including paper and electronic records.
They include adding records to storage, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, permanent withdrawals from storage, and destruction of records. Service charges are
generally assessed for each procedure on a per unit basis. The

SafekeeperPLUS

® system controls the service processes from order entry
through transportation and invoicing for business records management while the

MediaLink

™ and

SecureBase

™ systems manage the process for the data
protection services business.

Courier
operations consist primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request. Charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location and
are billed monthly. As of December 31, 2004, we were utilizing a fleet of approximately 2,900 owned or leased vehicles.

Secure Shredding

Secure shredding is a natural extension of our records management services, completing the life cycle of a record. The service involves the shredding of sensitive
documents for corporate customers that, in many cases, also use our services for management of less sensitive archival records. We believe that customers are motivated by increased privacy regulation
and the desire to protect their proprietary trade secrets. These services typically include the scheduled pick-up of loose office records which customers accumulate in specially designed
secure containers we provide. Complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste paper to third-party recyclers. Through a combination of plant-based shredding operations and
mobile shredding units comprised of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our customers in all of our existing business records management markets throughout the U.S.
and Canada. We seek to expand our presence in this


business
through acquisitions and internal start-ups that leverage our existing records management infrastructure.

Intellectual Property Management Services

We provide intellectual property management services through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Iron Mountain Intellectual Property Management, Inc. ("IPM"). IPM
specializes in third party technology escrow services that protect intellectual property assets such as software source code. In addition, IPM assists in securing intellectual property as collateral
for lending, investments and joint ventures, in managing domain name registrations and transfers, and in providing expertise and assistance to brokers and dealers in complying with electronic records
regulations of the SEC.

Digital Archiving Services

Our digital archiving services focus on archiving digital information with long-term preservation requirements. These services represent the digital
analogy to our physical records management services. Because of increased litigation risks and regulatory mandates, companies are increasingly aware of the need to apply the same records management
policies and retention schedules to electronic data as they do physical records. Typical digital records include e-mail, e-statements, images, electronic documents retained for
legal or compliance purposes and other data documenting business transactions.

The
growth rate of mission-critical digital information is accelerating, driven in part by the use of the Internet as a distribution and transaction medium. The rising cost and
increasing importance of digital information management, coupled with the increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may create meaningful opportunities for us. We
continue to cultivate marketing and technology partnerships to support this anticipated growth.

We
believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they face in their business records management programs and consist
primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access to and control over the data in a secure environment; and (3) the need to retain electronic records due
to regulatory compliance or for litigation support. Our digital archiving service is representative of our commitment to address evolving records management needs and expand the array of services we
offer.

Complementary Services and Products

We offer a variety of additional services which customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. These services include conducting records
inventories, packing records into cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. We also provide services for the management of active records
programs. We can provide these services, which generally include document and file processing and storage, both off-site at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel to perform
management functions on-site at the customer's premises.

Other
complementary lines of business that we operate include fulfillment services and professional consulting services. Fulfillment services are performed by our wholly-owned
subsidiary, COMAC, Inc. ("COMAC"). COMAC stores customer marketing literature and delivers this material to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' sites based on current and
prospective customer orders. In addition, COMAC assembles custom marketing packages and orders, and manages and provides detailed reporting on customer marketing literature inventories.

We
provide professional consulting services to customers, enabling them to develop and implement comprehensive records and information management programs. Our consulting business draws
on our experience in information storage and protection services to analyze the practices of companies and assist them in creating more effective programs of records and information management. Our


consultants
work with these customers to develop policies for document review, analysis and evaluation and for scheduling of document retention and destruction.

We
also sell: (1) a full line of specially designed corrugated cardboard, metal and plastic storage containers; (2) magnetic media products including computer tapes,
cartridges and drives, tape cleaners and supplies and CDs; and (3) computer room equipment and supplies such as racking systems, furniture, bar code scanners and printers.

Financial Characteristics of Our Business

Our financial model is based on the recurring nature of our revenues. The historical predictability of this revenue stream and the resulting operating income
before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA")


allow us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. Our primary financial goal has always been, and continues to be, to increase
consolidated OIBDA in relation to capital invested, even
as our focus has shifted from growth through acquisitions to internal revenue growth. Our business has the following financial characteristics:


For
a more detailed definition and reconciliation of OIBDA and a discussion of why we believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential
investors, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Measures."

•

Recurring Revenues.

We derive a majority of our consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, fees
charged to customers based on the volume of records stored. Our quarterly revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 64 consecutive quarters. Once a customer places physical
records in storage with us and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed, for which we typically receive a service fee, we receive recurring payments for storage fees without incurring
additional labor or marketing expenses or significant capital costs. Similarly, contracts for the storage of electronic backup media consist primarily of fixed monthly payments. In each of the last
five years, storage revenues, which are stable and recurring, have accounted for over 57% of our total revenues. This stable and growing storage revenue base also provides the foundation for increases
in service revenues and OIBDA.

•

Historically Non-Cyclical Storage Business.

We have not experienced any significant reductions in
our storage business as a result of past general economic downturns, although we can give no assurance that this would be the case in the future. We believe that companies that have outsourced records
management services are less likely during economic downturns to incur the move-out costs and other expenses associated with switching vendors or moving their records management services
programs in-house. However, during this most recent economic slowdown, the rate at which some customers added new cartons to their inventory was below historical levels. The net effect of
these factors is the continued growth of our storage revenue base, albeit at a lower rate.

•

Inherent Growth from Existing Physical Records Customers.

Our physical records customers have on average
generated additional cartons at a faster rate than stored cartons have been destroyed or permanently removed. We estimate that inherent growth from existing customers represents approximately half of
total net volume growth in North America. We believe the consistent growth of our physical records storage revenues is the result of a number of factors, including: (1) the trend toward
increased records retention; (2) customer satisfaction with our services; and (3) the costs and inconvenience of moving storage operations in-house or to another provider of
information storage and protection services.

•

Diversified and Stable Customer Base.

As of December 31, 2004, we had over 235,000 customer accounts in a
variety of industries. We currently provide services to numerous commercial,
legal,


banking,
healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 95% of the Fortune 1000 and more than two-thirds of the FTSE 100. No customer accounted for
more than 2% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004. For the years 2002 through 2004, the average volume reduction due to customers terminating their relationship
with us was less than 2%.

•

Capital Expenditures Related Primarily to Growth.

Our information storage and protection business requires
limited annual capital expenditures made in order to maintain our current revenue stream. For the years 2002 through 2004, over 85% of our aggregate capital expenditures were growth-related
investments, primarily in storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. These growth-related capital expenditures
are primarily discretionary and create additional capacity for increases in revenues and OIBDA. In addition, since shifting our focus from growth through acquisitions to internal revenue growth, our
capital expenditures, made primarily to support our internal revenue growth, have exceeded the aggregate acquisition consideration we conveyed in both 2001 and 2002. Although this was not the case in
2003 due to the acquisition of Hays IMS and in 2004 due to the acquisition of Connected and the 49.9% equity interest held by Mentmore in IME, we expect this to be the case in 2005 and thereafter.

Growth Strategy

Our objective is to maintain our position as the leader in information storage and protection services. In the U.S. and Canada, we seek to be one of the largest
information storage and protection services providers in each of our geographic markets. Internationally, our objectives are to continue to capitalize on our expertise in the information storage and
protection services industry and to make additional acquisitions and investments in selected international markets. Our primary avenues of growth are: (1) increased business with existing
customers; (2) the addition of new customers; (3) the introduction of new products and services such as secure shredding, electronic vaulting and digital archiving; and
(4) selective acquisitions in new and existing markets.

Growth from Existing Customers

Our existing customers storing physical records contribute to storage and storage-related service revenues growth because on average they generate additional
cartons at a faster rate than old cartons
are destroyed or permanently removed. In order to maximize growth opportunities from existing customers, we seek to maintain high levels of customer retention by providing premium customer service
through our local account management staff.

Our
sales coverage model is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by reallocating our sales resources based on a more sophisticated segmentation of our
customer base and selling additional business records management and data protection services within our existing customer relationships. We also seek to leverage existing business relationships with
our customers by selling complementary services and products. Services include records tracking, indexing, customized reporting, vital records management and consulting services.

Addition of New Customers

Our sales forces are dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer account relationships, (2) generating additional revenue
from existing customers and (3) expanding new and existing customer relationships by effectively selling a wide array of complementary services and products. In order to accomplish these
objectives, our sales forces draw on our U.S. and international marketing organizations and senior management. As a result of acquisitions and our decision to recruit additional qualified sales
professionals, we have increased the size of our sales force to approximately 700 such professionals as of December 31, 2004 from approximately 450 as of December 31, 2002.


Introduction of New Products and Services

We continue to expand our menu of products and services. We have established a national presence in the U.S. and Canadian secure shredding industry and offer new
electronic vaulting and digital archiving services. These new products and services allow us to further penetrate our existing customer accounts and attract new customers in previously untapped
markets.

Growth through Acquisitions

Our acquisition strategy includes expanding geographically, as necessary, and increasing our presence and scale within existing markets through
"fold-in" acquisitions. We have a successful
record of acquiring and integrating information storage and protection services companies. Between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2000, the height of our acquisition activity, we
completed 78 acquisitions in North America, Europe and Latin America for total consideration of approximately $2 billion, including approximately $1.0 billion associated with our merger
with Pierce Leahy Corp. ("Pierce Leahy") in February 2000. During that period, we substantially completed our geographic expansion in North America and began to expand in Europe and Latin America.
Between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2004, we completed an additional 63 acquisitions for total consideration of approximately $890 million, primarily in the information
storage and protection services industry in North America, Europe and Latin America and the secure shredding industry in North America. The major transactions during this period included the Hays IMS
acquisition in July 2003 for approximately $333 million, the acquisition of the 49.9% interest held by Mentmore in IME for approximately 82.5 million British pounds sterling
($154 million) in cash in February 2004 and the Connected acquisition in November 2004 for approximately $109 million, net of cash acquired.

Acquisitions in the U.S. and Canada

We intend to continue our acquisition program in the U.S. and Canada focusing on the secure shredding industry, expanding geographically, as necessary and
building scale in some of our smaller markets through "fold-in" acquisitions. However, given the small number of large acquisition prospects and our increased revenue base, future
acquisitions are expected to be less significant to overall U.S. and Canadian revenue growth than they were prior to 2001.

International Growth Strategy

We also intend to continue to make acquisitions and investments in information storage and protection services businesses outside the U.S. and Canada. We have
acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire and invest in, information storage and protection services companies in countries, and, more specifically, markets within such countries, where we believe
there is sufficient demand from existing multinational customers or the potential for significant growth. Since beginning our international expansion program in January 1999, we have directly
and through joint ventures, expanded our operations into 20 countries in Europe and Latin America. These transactions have taken, and may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of the entire
business or controlling or minority investments, with a long-term goal of full ownership. In addition to the criteria we use to evaluate U.S. and Canadian acquisition candidates, we also
evaluate the presence in the potential market of our existing customers as well as the risks uniquely associated with an international investment, including those risks described below.

The
experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important in our international acquisition strategy. As a result, we have formed joint ventures with, or acquired
significant interests in, target businesses throughout Europe and Latin America. We began our international expansion by acquiring a 50.1% controlling interest in each of our Iron Mountain Europe
Limited, Iron Mountain South America, Ltd. ("IMSA") and Sistemas de Archivo Corporativo (a Mexican limited liability company) subsidiaries. IMSA has in some cases bought controlling, yet not


full,
ownership in local businesses in order to enhance our local market expertise. We believe this strategy, rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets, better position us to expand
the existing business. The local partner benefits from our expertise in the information storage and protection services industry, our access to capital and our technology, and we benefit from our
local partner's knowledge of the market, relationships with customers and their presence in the community.

Our
long-term goal is to acquire full ownership of each such business. To that end, in February 2004 we acquired the 49.9% equity interest held by Mentmore in IME and
in January 2005 we acquired the 49.9% equity interest in IMSA held by Compass Capital Fund L.P. In addition, we have bought out partnership interests, in whole or in part, in Chile, Mexico,
Eastern Europe and the Netherlands. As a result of these transactions we have direct ownership of more than 98% of our international operations.

Our
international investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as
fluctuations in currency valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors.

The
amount of our revenues derived from international operations and other relevant financial data for fiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004 are set forth in Note 12 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, we derived approximately 14%, 19% and 27%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside of the U.S.
As of December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, we have long-lived assets of approximately 16%, 27% and 31%, respectively, from outside of the U.S.

Customers

Our customer base is diversified in terms of revenues and industry concentration. We track customer accounts based on invoices. Accordingly, depending upon how
many invoices have been arranged at the request of a customer, one organization may represent multiple customer accounts. As of December 31, 2004, we had over 235,000 customer accounts in a
variety of industries. We currently provide services to numerous commercial, legal, banking, healthcare, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 95% of
the Fortune 1000 and more than two-thirds of the FTSE
100. No customer accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Competition

We compete with our current and potential customers' internal information storage and protection services capabilities. We can provide no assurance that these
organizations will begin or continue to use an outside company such as Iron Mountain for their future information storage and protection services.

We
compete with multiple information storage and protection services providers in all geographic areas where we operate. We believe that competition for customers is based on price,
reputation for reliability, quality of service and scope and scale of technology and that we generally compete effectively based on these factors.

We
also compete with other information storage and protection services providers for companies to acquire. Some of our competitors may possess substantial financial and other resources.
If any such competitor were to devote additional resources to the information storage and protection services business and such acquisition candidates or focus their strategy on our markets, our
results of operations could be adversely affected.


Alternative Technologies

We derive most of our revenues from the storage of paper documents and storage-related services. This storage requires significant physical space. Alternative
storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than paper documents. These technologies include computer media, microform, CD-ROM and optical disk. To date,
none of these technologies has replaced paper documents as the principal means for storing information. However, we can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most of their
records in paper documents format. We continue to invest in additional services such as electronic vaulting and digital archiving, designed to address our customers' need for efficient,
cost-effective, high quality solutions for electronic records and information management.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, we employed over 9,500 employees in the U.S. and over 5,000 employees outside of the U.S. At December 31, 2004, an
aggregate of 460 employees were represented by unions in California and two cities in Canada.

All
non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability,
retirement/401(k) and accidental death and dismemberment plans. Unionized employees receive these types of benefits through their unions. In addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, all
full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits, collections or attainment of specified objectives
for the unit in which they work. Management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and unions.

Insurance

For strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate
capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. Property insurance is purchased on an all-risk basis, including flood and earthquake, subject to certain policy conditions,
sublimits and deductibles, and inclusive of the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. Separate excess policies for
insurer defined Critical Earthquake Zone exposures are maintained at what we believe to be appropriate limits and deductibles for that exposure. Included among other types of insurance that we carry
are: workers compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional and directors and officers liability policies, subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. In
2002, we established a wholly-owned Vermont domiciled captive insurance company as a subsidiary; through the subsidiary we retain and reinsure a portion of our property loss exposure.

Our
standard form of storage contract sets forth an agreed maximum valuation for each carton or other storage unit held by us, which serves as a limitation of liability for loss or
damage, as permitted under the Uniform Commercial Code. In contracts containing such limits, such values are nominal, and we believe that in typical circumstances our liability would be so limited in
the event of loss or damage to stored items for which we may be held liable. However, some of our agreements with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no
such limits or contain higher limits or supplemental insurance arrangements.

Environmental Matters

Some of our currently and formerly owned or operated properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes that involved the
use or storage of hazardous substances or petroleum products or may have involved the generation of hazardous wastes. In some instances these properties included the operation of underground storage
tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. We have undertaken remediation activities at some of our properties. Although


we
regularly conduct limited environmental reviews of real property that we intend to purchase, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our owned and operated
properties. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be potentially liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at
owned and operated properties as well as damages arising from such contamination. Environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future.
In addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today.

We
transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers
all owned and leased locations. Coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs.

Item 2. Properties.

As of December 31, 2004, we conducted operations through 627 leased facilities and 206 facilities that we own. Our facilities are divided among our
reportable segments as follows: Business Records Management (563), Data Protection (63), International (193) and Corporate and Other (14). These facilities contain a total of
51.7 million square feet of space. Facility rent expense was $112.8 million and $134.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. The leased facilities
typically have initial lease terms of ten years with options to renew for an additional five to ten years. In addition, some of the leases contain either a purchase option or a right of first refusal
upon the sale of the property. Our facilities are located throughout North America, Europe and Latin America, with the largest number of facilities in California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, Texas,
Canada and the U.K. We believe that the space available in our facilities is adequate to meet our current needs, although future growth may require that we acquire additional real property either by
leasing or purchasing. See Note 13 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our minimum annual rental commitments.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Pierce, H-W Associates, Pioneer and Sequedex Proceedings

We are involved as a plaintiff or defendant in a series of actions in New Jersey and Pennsylvania generally involving or arising out of assertions by Iron
Mountain Incorporated that J. Peter Pierce, Sr. and others engaged in conduct in respect of an entity, Sequedex, LLC ("Sequedex"), that constituted a breach of Mr. Pierce's contractual and
fiduciary obligations to us. The following is a summary of each of those cases.


On
March 28, 2002, we and Iron Mountain Information Management, Inc. ("IMIM"), one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, commenced an action in the Middlesex County, New
Jersey, Superior Court, Chancery Division, captioned Iron Mountain Incorporated and Iron Mountain Information Management, Inc. v. J. Peter Pierce, Sr., Douglas B. Huntley, J. Michael Gold, Fred
A. Mathewson, Jr.,
Michael DiIanni, J. Anthony Hayden, Pioneer Capital, LLC, and Sequedex, LLC. In the complaint, we alleged that defendant J. Peter Pierce, Sr., a former member of our Board of Directors and the former
President of IMIM until his termination without cause effective June 30, 2000, violated his fiduciary obligations, as well as various noncompetition and other provisions of an employment
agreement with us, dated February 1, 2000, by providing direct and/or indirect financial, management and other support to defendant Sequedex. Sequedex was established in October 2000,
and competed directly with us in the records and information management services industry. The complaint also alleged that Mr. Pierce and certain of the other defendants, who were employed by
or affiliated with Pierce Leahy Corp. prior to the merger of Pierce Leahy with Iron Mountain in February 2000, misappropriated and used our trade secrets and other confidential information.
Finally, the complaint asserted claims against Sequedex and others for tortious interference with contractual relations, against all of the defendants for civil conspiracy in respect of the matters
described above, and against defendant Michael DiIanni for breach of his employment agreement with IMIM, dated September 6, 2000. The litigation sought injunctions in respect of certain matters
and recovery of damages against the defendants.

On
April 12, 2002, we also initiated a related arbitration proceeding against Mr. Pierce before the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, office of the American Arbitration
Association (the "AAA") pursuant to an arbitration clause in the employment agreement between us and Mr. Pierce. In the arbitration, Mr. Pierce counterclaimed for indemnification of his
expenses, including attorneys' fees. We disputed Mr. Pierce's claim. On July 19, 2002, the litigation was stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding. On February 25,
2003, in response to our request, the AAA removed the arbitrator. The arbitration proceeding was transferred by agreement of the parties to ADR Options, Inc. On February 4, 2004, the
arbitrator rendered a decision. The arbitrator did not find the evidence provided by us in our action against Mr. Pierce sufficient to rule in our favor on the particular claims at issue. In
addition, the arbitrator ruled that, pursuant to an indemnification provision in Mr. Pierce's employment agreement, we must pay Mr. Pierce's attorneys fees and costs that are
attributable to this single arbitration. The arbitrator established a procedure to ascertain the amount of these fees and expenses. We filed a motion to vacate the arbitrator's decision and award in
Middlesex County, New Jersey. On June 16, 2004, that court denied our motion to vacate and confirmed the arbitration decision. We appealed the court's decision to the Appellate Division of the
New Jersey Superior Court and voluntarily withdrew, without prejudice, the claims in that case other than those purportedly covered by the arbitration decision. Mr. Pierce filed a motion to
dismiss the appeal, which was denied by the Appellate Division. Mr. Pierce subsequently filed an opposition to the appeal. The parties are awaiting notice of a hearing date for the appeal.

On
September 13, 2004, the arbitrator issued a final award, granting Mr. Pierce indemnification for legal expenses incurred in the arbitration in the amount of
approximately $1.6 million. Mr. Pierce brought an action in the Superior Court for Middlesex County to confirm such award and such court issued an order to show cause. We opposed this
action and filed a motion to dismiss Mr. Pierce's claims and vacate the arbitration award, or in the alternative, for a stay pending disposition of the pending appeal regarding the motion to
vacate.

On
December 16, 2002, Hartford Windsor Associates, L.P. ("H-W Associates"), Hartford General, LLC, J. Anthony Hayden, Mr. Pierce, Frank Seidman and John H.
Greenwald, Jr. commenced an action in the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, against us. In the complaint, the plaintiffs allege that H-W Associates purchased a
warehouse property in Connecticut to serve as a records storage facility, and entered into a lease for the facility with Sequedex, then a competitor of ours, and that the remaining plaintiffs were
limited or general partners of H-W Associates. The plaintiffs also allege that we tortiously interfered with Sequedex's contractual relations with an actual or


prospective
customer of Sequedex and, as a result, caused Sequedex to default on its lease to H-W Associates. The complaint seeks damages in excess of $0.1 million. We have denied
the material allegations in the complaint filed against us by H-W Associates and the other plaintiffs and have since filed counterclaims against the plaintiffs alleging tortious
interference with our business relationship with one of our longstanding customers. Certain discovery has been undertaken.

Also
on December 16, 2002, Pioneer Capital L.P. ("Pioneer"), Pioneer Capital Genpar, Inc. ("PCG"), the general partner of Pioneer, and Mr. Pierce, the President of
PCG, commenced an action in the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, against Iron Mountain Incorporated, C. Richard Reese, John F. Kenny, Jr., Garry Watzke, Schooner Capital LLC
("Schooner") and Vincent J. Ryan. The named individuals are Directors and/or officers of Iron Mountain and Schooner is a shareholder of Iron Mountain. In the complaint, the plaintiffs allege that the
defendants had numerous conversations and arrangements with Thomas Carr, one of Mr. Pierce's and Pioneer's business partners in a company named Logisteq LLC. The plaintiffs further allege that,
as a result of such conversations and arrangements, defendants conspired to, and did intentionally, interfere with Pioneer's relationship with its partner and Logisteq. The plaintiffs also allege that
defendants damaged Mr. Pierce's reputation in the community by telling our employees and other third parties that Mr. Pierce breached his employment agreement with us, misappropriated
and used our confidential information, breached his fiduciary duties to our shareholders and assisted Sequedex, then a competitor of ours, in unfairly competing with us. Finally, the complaint alleges
that the business partner in Logisteq taped conversations with Mr. Pierce and others which allegedly violated privacy laws, that the defendants knew, or should have known, that the tapes were
being made without the consent of the individuals and, as a result, Mr. Pierce was harmed. The complaint seeks damages in excess of $5.0 million. We and the other defendants have
challenged the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs' pleadings in each of these cases and the court has issued a notice of its intention to dismiss the case for inactivity unless a party gives written
notice of his or its intention to proceed by April 15, 2005.

On
September 10, 2003, IMIM filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania in a matter related to the litigation between Iron Mountain
Incorporated and Sequedex, Mr. Pierce and others disclosed above. The new matter named Sequedex, J. Michael Gold and Peter Hamilton as defendants, and alleges that in 2000 defendants Gold and
Hamilton, both former IMIM employees, used confidential and proprietary business information that they had obtained while employed by IMIM to form their own records management company, Sequedex. The
complaint also alleged unlawful interference with IMIM's contractual relationship with a certain customer and other matters. The defendants filed preliminary objections to our complaint and we
answered those preliminary objections. This matter has been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.

In
approximately October 2000, three former management employees of IMIM became employed by or otherwise associated with Sequedex. IMIM commenced actions against these three
former employees to enforce its rights under their confidentiality and non-competition agreements. IMIM also asserted claims against Sequedex for tortious interference with these
agreements, and against both Sequedex and the former employees for misappropriation and use of IMIM's trade secrets and confidential information.

The
defendants in all three cases denied the material allegations in IMIM's complaints and asserted various affirmative defenses. Sequedex and the individual defendants filed
counterclaims against IMIM and third party complaints against Iron Mountain Incorporated. The counterclaims and third party complaints asserted claims for tortious interference with certain contracts
and prospective business relations between Sequedex and its current and potential customers as well as a claim for trade disparagement and defamation, and sought approximately $58 million in
damages, plus unspecified punitive damages. A trial of the three actions in which the Sequedex counterclaims and third party complaints were asserted occurred in April and May of 2004. On
June 18, 2004, the Court


held
that the three individual defendants had not violated their covenants not to compete and had not misappropriated any of IMIM's trade secrets or confidential information, that Sequedex had not
tortiously interfered with those agreements, and that IMIM and Iron Mountain Incorporated had not interfered with any of Sequedex's potential or actual business relationships and had not disparaged or
defamed Sequedex. The Court thus entered a judgment dismissing all claims and counterclaims. Sequedex appealed the Court's decision to the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court. Iron
Mountain Incorporated and IMIM filed an appellate brief in opposition to Sequedex's appeal. We intend to oppose the appeal by Sequedex vigorously. The parties are awaiting notice of a hearing date for
the appeal.

General

In addition to the matters discussed above, we are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business with a portion of the defense
and/or settlement costs being covered by various commercial liability insurance policies purchased by us. In the opinion of management, no other material legal proceedings are pending to which we, or
any of our properties, are subject.

The
outcome of Pierce, H-W Associates, Pioneer and Sequedex proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Based on our present assessment of the situation, after
consultation with legal counsel, management does not believe that the outcome of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, although
there can be no assurance in this regard.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders of Iron Mountain during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.


PART II

Item 5. Market for the Registrant's Common Stock, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "IRM." On May 27, 2004, our board authorized and approved a
three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a dividend on our common stock. We issued the additional shares of common stock resulting from this stock dividend on
June 30, 2004 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 15, 2004.

The
following table sets forth the high and low sale prices on the NYSE, for the years 2003 and 2004, giving effect to such stock split:

The
closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on March 2, 2005 was $30.45. As of March 2, 2005, there were 529 holders of record of our common stock. We believe that
there are more than 24,000 beneficial owners of our common stock.

The
only dividends we have paid on our common stock during the last two years was the stock dividend paid in connection with the stock split referenced above. Our Board currently intends
to retain future earnings, if any, for the development of our business and does not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any determinations by our Board to
pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations and business requirements. Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
dated July 8, 2004 contains provisions permitting the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases subject to certain limitations.

On
February 1, 2000, we completed a merger with Pierce Leahy in a transaction valued at approximately $1,036,000. The results of the Pierce Leahy merger are reflected in the
table above beginning with 11 months of activity in 2000. In addition, we recorded specific charges associated with the integration of the operations of Pierce Leahy in 2000, 2001 and 2002
within merger related expenses and recorded non-cash stock option compensation expense as a result of the Pierce Leahy acquisition in 2000. This merger impacts the comparability of results
before and after the merger.

(2)

Effective
January 1, 2002, we ceased amortizing our goodwill balance in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets." The accounting change impacts the comparability of results to previous years. See Note 2(g) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

(3)

Effective
January 1, 2003, we began using the fair value method of accounting in our financial statements using the prospective method in accordance with SFAS No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure." As a result, we recorded $1,664 and
$3,857 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively, associated with such stock compensation expenses.

(4)

OIBDA
is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses. OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing OIBDA by total revenues. For a more detailed definition and
reconciliation of OIBDA and a discussion of why we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Measures."

(5)

We
reported a loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and minority interest for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001. We would have needed to
generate for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 additional income from operations before provision for income taxes and minority interest of $23,291 and $28,111, respectively, to cover
our fixed charges of $154,975 and $177,032, respectively.


Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" and the Consolidated Financial Statements
and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing.

This discussion contains "forward-looking statements," as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other federal
securities laws. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" on page ii of this filing.

Overview

Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service and storage material sales revenues. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance
indicator for the information storage and protection services industry, consist of largely recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials (either
on a per unit or per cubic foot of records basis), which are typically retained by customers for many years, and have accounted for over 57% of total consolidated revenues in each of the last five
years. Our quarterly revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 64 consecutive quarters. In certain circumstances, based upon customer requirements, storage revenues include
periodic charges associated with normal, recurring service activities. Service and storage material sales revenues are comprised of charges for related service activities and courier operations and
the sale of storage materials. Related core service revenues arise from additions of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, destructions of records,
permanent withdrawals from storage and the secure shredding of sensitive records. Our complementary services revenues arise from special project work, providing fulfillment services, consulting
services and sales of software licenses, specially designed storage containers, magnetic media including computer tapes and related supplies. Courier operations consist primarily of the pickup and
delivery of records upon customer request. Customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms. Our consolidated revenues are subject to variations caused
by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenue derived from outside the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, we derived 19.0% and 26.8%, respectively, of our total
revenues from outside the U.S. The increase in total revenues derived from outside the U.S. is primarily a result of our acquisition of Hays IMS.

Cost
of sales (excluding depreciation) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs including rent and utilities, transportation expenses
including vehicle leases and fuel, other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Trends in
total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets,
workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation. Trends in facility occupancy costs are similarly impacted by the total number of facilities
we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties.

The
expansion of our European operations, including the acquisition of Hays IMS, and secure shredding operations has resulted in changes to the mix of certain cost of sales components.
Our European and secure shredding operations are more labor intensive; therefore, our labor expense will be higher as a percentage of revenue as compared to our North American information storage and
protection operations. In addition, our secure shredding operations incur higher transportation costs and lower facility costs, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as compared to our North
American information storage and protection operations.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing


personnel,
as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars
and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability
in costs associated with medical insurance. Our adoption of the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148 has resulted in increasing amounts of selling, general
and administrative expenses. We began using the fair value method of accounting in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method
involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. The overhead structure of our
expanding European operations, as compared to our North American operations, is more labor intensive and has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage, which may result in an increase in
selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results.

Our
depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital-intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which
include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationships and acquisition costs.

In
February 2004, we completed the acquisition of the 49.9% equity interest held by Mentmore in IME. This transaction had no material impact on revenue or operating income since
we already fully consolidate IME's financial results. Since we have used the purchase method of accounting for this acquisition, 49.9% of the net assets of IME have been adjusted to reflect their fair
market value if different from their carrying value on the acquisition date. As a result, this transaction increased depreciation and amortization expenses. Additionally, we have recorded an increase
in interest expense, net associated with debt used to fund this acquisition and no longer record the minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries, net related to Mentmore's ownership interest in IME.

Our
consolidated expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on expenses incurred by our entities outside the U.S. During 2004, we have
seen increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the British pound sterling, the Euro, and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted
average rates for the comparable periods. It is difficult to predict how much foreign currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future and how those fluctuations will impact individual balances
reported in our consolidated statement of operations. Given the relative increase in our international operations, these fluctuations may become material on individual balances. However, because both
the revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations of our operating income, operating margin and
net income is mitigated.

Non-GAAP Measures

Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or OIBDA

OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses. OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing OIBDA by total revenues. Our management
uses these measures to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated business. As such, we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential
investors. We use OIBDA for planning purposes and multiples of current or projected OIBDA-based calculations in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise
valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe OIBDA and OIBDA Margin are useful measures to evaluate our ability to grow our revenues faster than our operating expenses and they are an
integral part of our internal reporting system utilized by management to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our


business.
OIBDA does not include certain items, specifically (1) minority interest in earnings (losses) of subsidiaries, net, (2) other (income) expense, net, (3) income from
discontinued operations and loss on sale of discontinued operations and (4) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results.
OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which management does not consider when
evaluating the profitability of our core operations. Finally, OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which management
believes is better evaluated by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. OIBDA and OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but
not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America, or GAAP, such as operating or net
income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP).

Critical Accounting Policies

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then
ended. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the estimates used, including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos, impairments of tangible and intangible assets,
income taxes, purchase accounting related reserves, self-insurance liabilities, incentive compensation liabilities, litigation liabilities and contingencies. We base our estimates on
historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. We use these estimates to assist us in the identification and assessment of the
accounting treatment necessary with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may


differ
from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order:

Accounting for Acquisitions

Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence
of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning, and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as
we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources.

Each
acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition, including,
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, "Accounting for Business Combinations," and more recently, SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." Accounting for these acquisitions has
resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each
acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment. These estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible
assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. We are not aware of any information that would indicate that the final
purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in 2004 would differ meaningfully from preliminary estimates. See Note 7 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
connection with each of our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings. Our restructuring
activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities, reductions in staffing levels, and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire. The estimated cost
of these restructuring activities are included as costs of the acquisition and are recorded as goodwill consistent with the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue
No. 95-3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination." While we finalize our plans to restructure the businesses we acquire within one year of
the date of acquisition, it may take more than one year to complete all activities related to the restructuring of an acquired business.

Our
acquisitions have resulted in a significant accumulation of goodwill. Beginning on January 1, 2002, we ceased to amortize goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142. We
reviewed goodwill for impairment consistent with the guidelines of SFAS No. 142 using a discounted future cash flow approach to approximate fair value. The result of testing our goodwill for
impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, as of January 1, 2002, was a non-cash charge of $6.4 million (net of minority interest of $8.5 million), which,
consistent with SFAS No. 142, is reported in the caption "cumulative effect of change in accounting principle" in our consolidated statement of operations. Impairment adjustments recognized in
the future, if any, are generally required to be recognized as operating expenses. The $6.4 million charge related to our South American reporting unit within our international reporting
segment. The South American reporting unit failed the impairment test primarily due to a reduction in the expected future performance of the unit resulting from a deterioration of the local economic
environment and the devaluation of the currency in Argentina. As goodwill amortization expense in our South American reporting unit is not deductible for tax purposes, this impairment charge is not
net of a tax benefit. At the time of the impairment, we had a controlling interest in Iron Mountain South America, Ltd ("IMSA") and the remainder was owned by an unaffiliated entity; in January
2005 we acquired the unaffiliated entity's interest in IMSA. IMSA has acquired a controlling interest in entities in which local partners have retained a minority interest in order to enhance our
local market expertise. These local partners have no ownership interest in IMSA. This caused the minority interest portion of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge ($8.5 million)
to


exceed
our portion of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge ($6.4 million). In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment
review date. We performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2004 and noted no impairment of goodwill at our reporting units as of that date. As of
December 31, 2004, no factors were identified that would alter this assessment.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memos

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required
payments and disputes regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior
trends in our aged receivables and credit memo activity, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to
significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. As of December 31, 2003 and 2004,
our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos balance totaled $20.9 million and $13.9 million, respectively. The decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos
as of December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003 is primarily attributable to the success of our centralized collection efforts within the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in
improved cash collections and an improved accounts receivable aging that enabled us to significantly reduce our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos. This decrease was partially offset by
an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos associated with businesses acquired during the year ended December 31, 2004.

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives), and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities on its balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (1) a
hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment; (2) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted
transaction; or (3) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an available-for-sale security,
or a foreign-currency-denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation.
Unrealized gains and losses are recognized each period as other comprehensive income which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items included in shareholders' equity, assets and
liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description of our derivative instruments.

In
order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The
effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are
recorded currently in earnings.

For
fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the effective portions
of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For hedges of foreign currency the accounting
treatment generally


follows
the treatment for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge.

Although
we apply some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is
such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high. We had net interest rate risk management liabilities of $11.3 million related
to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded charges totaling $9.5 million due to the recharacterization of interest rate swaps
associated with our real estate term loans. As of December 31, 2004, we had $2.7 million, net of tax of unrealized losses included in other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity.

We
provided the initial financing totaling 190.5 million British pounds sterling to IME for all of the consideration associated with the July 2003 acquisition of the European
operations of Hays IMS using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In order to minimize the foreign currency risk associated with providing IME with the consideration
necessary for the acquisition of Hays IMS, we borrowed 80.0 million British pounds sterling under our revolving credit facility to create a natural hedge against our British pounds sterling
denominated intercompany receivable from IME. The 80.0 million British pounds sterling outstanding under our revolving credit facility was repaid in March 2004 using proceeds received
from IME in repayment of the initial financing, which reduced the intercompany balance. Foreign currency losses and gains associated with the revolving credit balance were equivalent to gains and
losses recorded on the associated portion of the intercompany balance with IME. In addition, we entered into two cross currency swaps with a combined notional value of 100.0 million British
pounds sterling. These swaps each had a term of one year and at maturity we had a right to receive $162.8 million in exchange for 100.0 million British pounds sterling. We did not
designate these swaps as hedges and, therefore, all mark to market fluctuations of the swaps were recorded in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of operations from inception to
cash payment of the swaps. We have recorded foreign currency losses of $19.0 million and $8.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively, in other
(income) expense, net. Both cross currency swaps were terminated in March 2004 and were settled with proceeds received from IME in repayment of the initial financing.

One
of our interest rate swaps was used to hedge interest rate risk on certain variable operating lease commitments. As a result of the December 31, 2002 consolidation of one of
our variable interest entities ("VIE I"), the operating lease commitments that were hedged by this swap are now considered to be inter-company transactions and we determined that this hedge was no
longer effective on a prospective basis. We have consolidated the real estate term loans of VIE I, and beginning on January 1, 2003 we began prospectively recording interest expense instead of
rent expense as we made cash interest payments on this debt. In March 2004, we repaid this real estate term loan. As a result, we recorded a charge of $0.8 million in interest expense
due to recharacterization of the interest rate swap associated
with this real estate term loan. This charge represents the fair market value of the swap, which is a calculation of the net present value of the expected monthly cash payments over the remaining term
of the swap based on current market conditions, as of the date the real estate term loan was repaid. We did not terminate the swap and expect to enjoy the benefit of the fixed rate financing and will
continue to mark to market the fair market value of the derivative liability to interest expense, net and make our monthly cash payments as required under the swap contract for the remaining term.
This swap will terminate in March 2005.

Another
of our interest rate swaps was used to hedge interest rate risk on certain variable operating lease commitments. This swap agreement was established to hedge the majority of
interest rate risk associated with another of our variable interest entity's ("VIE III") real estate term loans. This swap had been since inception an effective hedge in accordance with SFAS
No. 133. As a result of repaying VIE III's real estate term loan in August 2004, we recorded an additional $8.7 million in interest expense due to recharacterization of the
interest rate swap associated with this real estate term


loan.
This charge represents the fair market value of the swap, which is a calculation of the net present value of the expected monthly cash payments over the remaining term of the swap based on
current market conditions, as of the date the real estate term loan was repaid. We did not terminate the swap and expect to enjoy the benefit of the fixed rate financing and will continue to mark to
market the fair market value of the derivative liability to interest expense, net and make our monthly cash payments as required under the swap contract for the remaining term of approximately three
years. See Notes 3, 4 and 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounting for Internal Use Software

We develop various software applications for internal use. We account for those costs in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position ("SOP")
98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." SOP 98-1 requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to
be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. SOP 98-1 also defines which types of costs should be capitalized and which should be expensed. Payroll and related
costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects, to the extent time is spent directly on the project, are
capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the project will
be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are evaluated for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No.144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."

It
may be necessary for us to write-off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. Our expansion into
new technology-based service offerings requires the development of internal use software that will be
susceptible to rapid and significant changes in technology. We may be required to write-off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal use software program is
replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the software's estimated useful life. General uncertainties related to expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and
market acceptance of our services, may adversely impact the recoverability of these assets.

During
the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, we replaced internal use software programs, which resulted in the write-off to loss on disposal/writedown of
property, plant and equipment, net of the remaining net book value of $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively. We did not have any such write-offs during 2004.

Deferred Income Taxes

We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In the ordinary course of our
business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to
realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates
reflected in the income tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in
which such determination is made.

We
have not provided deferred taxes on book basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future
and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis differences could be
reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries as well as certain other events or actions on our part, which would result in an increase in our provision for
income taxes.


In
December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Staff Position No. 109-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign
Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004" ("FSP 109-2"). The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("AJCA") introduces a special one-time
dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer ("repatriation provision"), provided certain criteria are met. FSP 109-2 provides accounting
and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. The Treasury Department or Congress will be providing additional clarifying language on key elements of the repatriation provision in the
future. FSP 109-2 grants an enterprise additional time beyond the year ended December 31, 2004, in
which the AJCA was enacted, to evaluate the effects of the AJCA on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted earnings. FSP 109-2 calls for enhanced disclosures of, among
other items, the status of our evaluations, the effects of completed evaluations, and the potential range of income tax effects of repatriations. Such disclosures are included in Note 10 to
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Stock-based Compensation

As of January 1, 2003, we adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148. As a result we began using the fair value
method of accounting in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards
granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. We have applied the fair value recognition provisions to all stock based awards granted,
modified or settled on or after January 1, 2003 and will continue to provide the required pro forma information for all awards previously granted, modified or settled before January 1,
2003 in our consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded $3.9 million of stock compensation expense in our consolidated statement of
operations. Had we elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of all options as of their grant dates as prescribed by SFAS No. 123 and No. 148, we would have recorded
stock compensation expense of $4.5 million, $5.6 million and $7.0 million in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004,
respectively.

In
December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment." SFAS No. 123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and
supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB No. 25"). Among other items, SFAS No. 123R eliminates the use of APB
No. 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting, and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant
date fair value of those awards, in the financial statements. The effective date of SFAS No. 123R is the first reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, which would be our third
quarter of 2005, although early adoption is allowed. SFAS No. 123R permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a "modified prospective" method, or a "modified retrospective"
method. Under the "modified prospective" method, compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for
all share-based payments granted after that date, and based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123R. Under the
"modified retrospective" method, the requirements are the same as under the "modified prospective" method, but this method also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods
based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with SFAS No. 123.

SFAS
No. 123R also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an
operating cash flow as required under current rules. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date. Since we do not
pay significant cash taxes currently, we do not expect this provision to materially impact our statement of cash flows within the next few years.


We
expect to adopt SFAS No. 123R effective July 1, 2005 using the modified prospective method of implementation. Based on outstanding stock options granted to employees
prior to our prospective implementation of the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148 on January 1, 2003, we expect to record approximately $0.9 million of
stock compensation expense in the second half of 2005 associated with unvested stock option grants issued prior to January 1, 2003.

Self-Insured Liabilities

We are self-insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers' compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and general business
liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and long-term disability programs. At December 31, 2003 and 2004 there were approximately $23.2 million and
$25.7 million, respectively, of self-insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost
experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability
for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date.

We
believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of estimate
techniques in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses
are consistently measured on a conservative basis. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these
liabilities.

Revenue

Our consolidated storage revenues increased $168.3 million, or 19.2%, to $1,043.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and
$115.5 million, or 15.2%, to $875.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase is
attributable to internal revenue growth (9% during 2004 and 8% during 2003) resulting from net increases in records and other media stored by existing customers and sales to new customers,
acquisitions (8% during 2004 and 5% during 2003), primarily consisting of $91.2 million and $30.0 million from the operations of Hays IMS in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations (3% during 2004 and 2% during 2003).

Consolidated
service and storage material sales revenues increased $147.9 million, or 23.6%, to $774.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and
$67.3 million, or 12.0%, to $626.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase is
attributable to acquisitions (14% during 2004 and 7% during 2003), including revenue from the Hays IMS operations of $86.3 million and $24.6 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively,
internal revenue growth (6% during 2004 and 3% during 2003) resulting from net increases in service and storage material sales to existing customers and sales to new customers, and foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations (3% during 2004 and 2% during 2003).

For
the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $316.3 million, or 21.1%, to $1,817.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and
$182.8 million, or 13.9%, to $1,501.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, and Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an
analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Internal revenue growth was 10%, 6%, and 8% for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. We calculate
internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations.

Our internal revenue growth rate represents the weighted average year over year growth rate of our revenues after removing the effects of
acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Over the past eight quarters, the internal growth rate of our storage revenues has consistently ranged between 8% and 9%. Our storage
revenue internal growth rate trend for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 reflects stable net carton volume growth in our North American records management business and strong growth
rates in our digital and international businesses. Net carton volume growth is a function of the rate new cartons are added by existing and new customers offset by the rate of carton destructions and
other permanent removals.

The
internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage revenue internal growth rate due to more discretionary services we
offer such as large special projects, data products and carton sales, and the cost of recycled paper. These revenues are impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel
the purchase of these


services
as a way to reduce their short-term costs. As a commodity, recycled paper prices are subject to the volatility of that market.

The
internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenues increased during 2004 compared to 2003 due primarily to high growth in our Secure Shredding product line and
several of our complementary service lines including data product sales, special projects and fulfillment services. The growth rate of our secure shredding product line increased for 2004 primarily
due to increased sales production as our entire records management sales force began selling the shredding product for the first time. In addition, our data product sales were particularly strong in
the second half of 2004 and we completed several large special projects in our film and sound and fulfillment product lines.

Labor

For the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, labor expense increased slightly as a percentage of revenue
due primarily to our mix of services. Specifically, increases in labor expense were caused by (1) more labor intensive operations, primarily in Europe and in our secure shredding operations,
(2) higher incentive compensation expense in 2004 compared to 2003, and (3) higher allocations of labor costs associated with internal information technology personnel and consultants to
revenue producing projects in our digital business. These increases were partially offset by improved labor management in our data protection operations.

For
the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, labor expense as a percentage of revenue decreased as a result of improved labor
management in our North American operations and lower incentive compensation expense. This improvement was partially offset by increases in wages, medical expenses, and headcount due to growth,
acquisitions, including Hays


IMS,
and changes in our labor mix resulting from the expansion of our secure shredding operations. Our secure shredding operations are more labor intensive, therefore, labor expense will be higher as
a percentage of revenue in these operations as compared to our storage operations.

Facilities

Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues decreased to 13.6% as of December 31, 2004 from 14.1% as of December 31, 2003. The
decrease in facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues was primarily a result of maintaining approximately the same overall base rent per square foot in our North American operations
during 2003 and 2004 while we increased our square footage under lease over that period. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which increased $21.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily as a result of increased rent in our European operations of $15.4 million attributable to new
facilities and properties acquired through acquisitions, including our acquisition of Hays IMS. Other facilities expenses in our European operations for year ended December 31, 2004 increased
$14.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily due to the growth of operations and acquisitions. Aside from our European operations, the remaining facilities
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were consistent with the year ended December 31, 2003.

Rent
expense increased $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily as a result of increased rent in our European operations of $9.0 million
attributable to new facilities and properties acquired through acquisitions, including our acquisition of Hays IMS. In addition, after adjusting for the consolidation of properties owned by our
variable interest entities, we increased the number of leased facilities we occupy in the U.S. and Canada as of December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 primarily due to
acquisitions. The increase in rent was offset by the consolidation of 38 properties owned by our variable interest entities during the third and fourth quarter of 2002. The leases associated with
these properties were accounted for as operating leases prior to December 31, 2002. We recorded $5.9 million of rent expense for these 38 properties during the year ended
December 31, 2002 and no rent expense in the year ended December 31, 2003. Rather than rent expense, we recorded interest expense and depreciation expense associated with these
properties for the year ended December 31, 2003. Aside from our European operations, the dollar increase in facilities expenses is attributable to property taxes, utilities, and property
insurance, which increased $5.5 million, $4.0 million, and $1.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31,
2002. Facilities expenses in our European operations increased $6.4 million primarily due to the growth of operations and acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to
the year ended December 31, 2002.

Transportation

Our transportation expenses, which increased 0.2% as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2003, are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses, and maintenance. In the
year ended December 31, 2004, we experienced a $7.0 million increase in transportation expenses in our European operations as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, which
is primarily attributable to an increase in fleet size and vehicles under operating lease resulting from the acquisition of Hays IMS and growth of operations. An increased percentage of vehicles under
operating lease, higher fuel expenses, and increased subcontracted courier expenses during the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 also contributed
to higher expenses.

In
the year ended December 31, 2003, our transportation expenses were flat as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Transportation expenses increased $3.4 million in our
European operations as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, which is primarily attributable to an increase in fleet


size
and vehicles under operating lease resulting from the acquisition of Hays IMS and growth of operations. Transportation efficiencies achieved in our North American operations, partially offset by
higher fuel costs and an increased percentage of vehicles under operating lease, mitigated the impact of our European operations on transportation expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues.

Product and Other Cost of Sales

Product and other cost of sales are highly correlated to complementary revenue streams. Product and other cost of sales for the year ended December 31,
2004 were higher than the year ended December 31, 2003 as a percentage of consolidated revenues due to increased royalty payments associated with our electronic vaulting revenues and increased
sales of lower margin data products in the second half of 2004.

General and Administrative

The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year
ended December 31, 2003 is primarily attributable to a $31.0 million increase in general and administrative expenses in our European operations due to the growth of operations and
acquisitions, including Hays IMS. In our North American operations, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of increased headcount and higher wages due to normal inflation and merit
increases, increased stock compensation expense, increased travel, recruiting, and professional fees, including costs associated with compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These increases
were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses.


The
increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 is primarily attributable to a
$16.4 million increase in general and administrative expenses in our European operations due to the growth of operations and acquisitions. In our North American operations, general and
administrative expenses increased as a result of higher wages due to normal inflation and merit increases, and increases in worker's compensation and medical expenses and was partially offset by
decreases in general insurance expenses and lower incentive compensation expenses.

Sales, Marketing & Account Management

The majority of our sales, marketing and account management costs are labor related and are primarily driven by the headcount in each of these departments.
Increased headcount and commissions are the most significant contributors to the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2004. Throughout the year ended December 31, 2003 and during 2004, we continued to invest in the expansion and improvement of our sales force and account management personnel. We added sales
and marketing employees, enlarged our account management force, and continued several new marketing and promotional efforts to develop awareness in the marketplace of our entire service offerings. The
costs associated with these efforts contributed to the increase in our sales, marketing and account management expenses. Our larger North American sales force generated a $10.3 million increase
in sales commissions for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2003 our North American sales force
generated a comparable increase of $10.3 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In addition, costs associated with our European sales and account management teams increased by
$7.7 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, compared to the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, due to the
doubling of our sales force through the hiring of new personnel and acquisitions. We expect that sales, marketing and account management expenses will continue to increase as a percentage of
consolidated revenues as our sales force gains traction and we continue to develop new product development and marketing initiatives.

Information Technology

Information technology expenses remained flat as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2003. Higher utilization of existing information technology resources and increased allocations of information technology resources to revenue producing projects were offset by
increases in internal software development projects within our digital business, the acquisition of Connected, associated research and development activities and increased information technology
spending in our European operations of $8.5 million.

Information
technology expenses increased as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 principally due to higher compensation costs resulting from
increased headcount, normal inflation and merit increases, as well as an increase in external resources, which was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses. As our technology
initiatives mature, less of our efforts are development related, thus decreasing capitalizable expenditures, which results in increased information technology expenses. In addition, we incurred
additional costs to expand bandwidth and international connectivity in the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 to satisfy growth of our business
and to integrate acquisitions.

Bad Debt Expense

The decrease in consolidated bad debt expense for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 compared to prior years is primarily attributable to the
success of our centralized collection efforts within the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in improved cash collections and an improved accounts


receivable
aging that allowed us to reduce our allowance for doubtful accounts during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004.

Depreciation, Amortization and (Gain) Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $32.7 million to $163.6 million (9.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2004 from $130.9 million (8.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003. Depreciation expense increased $28.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily due to the additional depreciation expense related to recent capital expenditures, including storage systems,
which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization expense increased $4.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 due to amortization of intangible assets, primarily customer relationship intangible assets acquired through business
combinations. We expect that amortization expense will continue to increase as we acquire new businesses and buy out our minority interest partners.

Consolidated
depreciation and amortization expense increased $21.9 million to $130.9 million (8.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003
from $109.0 million (8.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. Depreciation expense increased $19.8 million, primarily due to the additional
depreciation expense related to recent capital expenditures, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and
buildings, and depreciation associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Depreciation associated with our digital initiatives increased $5.4 million during the year ended
December 31, 2003 as a result of software and hardware assets placed in service throughout the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003. The consolidation of the properties owned by our
variable interest entities during the year ended December 31, 2002 resulted in $2.2 million of additional depreciation in the year ended December 31, 2003. Amortization expense
increased as a result of the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions we completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 and during the year ended December 31, 2003.

Consolidated
gains on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted primarily of a
$1.2 million gain on the sale of a property in Florida during the second quarter of 2004 offset by disposals and asset writedowns. We recorded consolidated losses on disposal/writedown of
property, plant and equipment, net of $1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2003 consisting of disposals and asset writedowns partially offset by $4.2 million of gains on
the sale of properties in Texas, Florida and the U.K. We recorded consolidated losses on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $0.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2002 consisting of disposals and asset writedowns partially offset by a $2.1 million gain on the sale of a property in the U.K.

Operating Income

As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $39.6 million, or 13.0%, to $344.5 million (19.0% of consolidated
revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $304.9 million (20.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Consolidated
operating income increased $52.3 million, or 20.7%, to $304.9 million (20.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003 from
$252.6 million (19.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002.


OIBDA

As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated OIBDA increased $72.3 million, or 16.6%, to $508.1 million (28.0% of consolidated revenues) for
the year ended December 31, 2004 from $435.8 million (29.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Consolidated
OIBDA increased $74.2 million, or 20.5%, to $435.8 million (29.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003 from
$361.6 million (27.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Interest Expense, Net

Consolidated interest expense, net increased $35.3 million to $185.7 million (10.2% of consolidated revenues) for year ended December 31,
2004 from $150.5 million (10.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003. Increased borrowings, primarily from the issuance of our 7


/


% GBP Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2014, contributed to the dollar increase in interest expense. The increase of interest expense, net as a percentage of consolidated revenues was partially due to charges
totaling $9.5 million (0.5% of consolidated revenues) related to recharacterization of interest rate swaps associated with real estate term loans we repaid in March and August 2004.
These charges represent the fair market value of the swaps, which is a calculation of the net present value of the expected monthly cash payments over the remaining term of the swap based on current
market conditions, as of the date the real estate term loan was repaid. We did not terminate the swaps and will continue to mark to market the fair market value of the derivative liability to interest
expense, net and make our monthly cash payments as required under the swap contract for the remaining term of approximately three years.

Consolidated
interest expense, net increased $13.8 million to $150.5 million (10.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003 from
$136.6 million (10.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily attributable to (1) $7.4 million of interest expense
associated with real estate term loans held by our variable interest entities that were consolidated in the second half of 2002, (2) borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the
issuance of our 6


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 (the "6


/


% notes") which were used to finance the Hays IMS acquisition, and (3) an increase in our
overall weighted average outstanding borrowings. The decrease as a percentage of revenues was attributable to the decline in our overall weighted average interest rate from 8.3% as of
December 31, 2002 to 7.7% as of December 31, 2003 resulting from our refinancing efforts and a decline in variable interest rates.

Foreign
currency gains of $8.9 million based on period-end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to the strengthening
of the British pound sterling, Euro, and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with our Canadian, U.K. and European subsidiaries, U.S.
dollar denominated debt held by our Canadian subsidiary, borrowings denominated in foreign currencies under our revolving credit facility, British pounds sterling denominated debt held by our U.S.
parent company, British pounds sterling currency held in the U.S. and our British pound sterling denominated cross currency swap, which was terminated in March 2004.

We
recorded foreign currency gains of $30.2 million and $5.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, based on period-end
exchange rates, primarily due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with our Canadian
and U.K. subsidiaries, U.S. dollar denominated debt held by our Canadian subsidiary, borrowings denominated in foreign currencies under our revolving credit facility, and our British pound sterling
denominated cross currency swap.

During
the three months ended March 31, 2004, we redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of the 8


/


% Senior Notes due 2008 of our Canadian subsidiary
(the "Subsidiary notes"), resulting in a charge of $2.0 million, and we repaid a portion of our real estate term loans, which resulted in a charge of $0.4 million. During the year ended
December 31, 2003, we redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of our 9


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007 (the "9


/


% notes"), resulting in a
charge of $1.8 million, the remaining outstanding principal amount of our 8


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009 (the "8


/


% notes"), resulting in a charge of
$13.8 million, and $115.0 million of the outstanding principal of our Subsidiary notes, resulting in a charge of $12.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we
recorded a charge of $1.2 million related to the early retirement of debt in conjunction with the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and a charge of $4.2 million related to the
early retirement of a portion of our 9


/


% notes. The charges consisted primarily of the call and tender premiums associated with the extinguished debt and the write-off of
unamortized deferred financing cost and discounts.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003, and 2004 were 41.3%, 42.5%, and 41.7%, respectively. The primary reconciling item
between the statutory rate of 35% and our effective rate is state income taxes (net of federal benefit). The disallowance of certain intercompany


interest
charges by states, including a change in Massachusetts tax laws, retroactive to January 1, 2002, increased our provision for income taxes by 1.1% and 1.0% for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide
provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax
estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals.
Additional taxes assessed as a result of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods in which that determination is made. As
a result of our net operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay any significant international, U.S. federal and state income taxes during 2005.

Minority Interest, Discontinued Operations, and Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

Minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries, net resulted in a charge to income of $3.6 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues), $5.6 million
(0.4% of consolidated revenues) and $3.0 million (0.2% of consolidated revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. This represents our minority
partners' share of earnings in our majority-owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results. The decrease during 2004 is a result of our acquisition of the remaining
49.9% equity interest in IME which was reflected for the first time during the second quarter of 2004. Increased profitability of our South American businesses in 2003 and 2004 contributed to the
increase in minority interest in 2003 and offset the impact of acquiring the remaining 49.9% equity interest in IME in 2004.

In
the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $1.1 million (net of tax of $0.8 million) as a result of resolving several outstanding
contingencies remaining from the sale of the Arcus Staffing Resources, Inc. business unit in 1999. There was no such income recorded in 2003 and 2004.

In
the first quarter of 2002, we recorded a non-cash charge for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $6.4 million (net of minority interest of
$8.5 million) as a result of our implementation of SFAS No. 142. There was no such charge in 2003 and 2004.

Net Income

As a result of the foregoing factors, for the year ended December 31, 2004 consolidated net income increased $9.6 million, or 11.3%, to
$94.2 million (5.2% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $84.6 million (5.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Consolidated
net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $26.3 million, or 45.2%, to $84.6 million (5.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended
December 31, 2003 from net income of $58.3 million (4.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, revenue in our business records management segment increased 8.3% primarily due to increased
storage revenues, growth of our secure shredding operations and acquisitions (including a full year of revenue from the U.S. operations of Hays IMS in 2004 which represents an increase of
$8.6 million over the partial year of revenue recorded in 2003), and was impacted by slower growth in service and special project revenue. In addition, favorable currency fluctuations during
the year ended December 31, 2004 in Canada increased revenue $7.8 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased
in the year ended December 31, 2004 due to higher transportation expenses and our increased investment in our sales and account management force, which were partially offset by reduced facility
expenses.

During
the year ended December 31, 2003, revenue in our business records management segment increased 8.2% primarily due to increased storage revenues, growth of our secure
shredding operations and acquisitions (including a partial year of revenue from the U.S. operations of Hays IMS of $8.2 million), and was offset by lower special project service revenue and
lower permanent removal and destruction fees. In addition, favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2003 in Canada increased revenue $9.6 million when compared
to the year ended December 31, 2002. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to lower bad debt expense and lower incentive compensation expense which were partially
offset by higher property taxes, utilities and our increased investment in our sales and account management force.

During
the year ended December 31, 2004, revenue in our data protection segment increased 11.1% primarily due to internal revenue growth from both existing and new customers.
Higher revenue growth rates from our product sales, electronic vaulting, and intellectual property management services augmented the segment's overall revenue growth rate. Contribution as a percent of
segment revenue decreased primarily due to decreased product sales margins, increased royalty payments, and the growth of our sales and account management force including higher sales commissions.
This decrease was partially offset by improved labor management and stable overhead costs.

During
the year ended December 31, 2003, revenue in our data protection segment increased 5.0% primarily due to internal revenue growth from both existing and new customers in the
face of increasing pressure in the marketplace to reduce information technology related spending. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to reduced bad debt expense and
improved labor management. This increase was partially offset by the growth of our sales and account management force.

Revenue
in our international segment increased 91.9% during the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to acquisitions completed in Europe, including a full year of revenue
from the acquisition of Hays IMS in 2004 which represents an increase of $114.2 million over the partial year of revenue recorded in 2003, and in South America and strong internal growth in
both Europe and Latin America. Favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2004 in Europe, Mexico and South America increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by
$35.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue remained flat primarily due to lower gross margins and increased overhead in our
European operations attributable to our acquisition integration efforts and the establishment of a new shared service center offset by improved gross margins from our South American and Mexican
operations.

Revenue
in our international segment increased 81.1% primarily due to acquisitions completed in Europe, including $46.4 million from the acquisition of Hays IMS, and in South
America, as well as strong internal growth and a large service project in the U.K. Favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2003 in Europe increased revenue, as
measured in U.S. dollars, by $17.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was offset by $1.2 million of unfavorable currency fluctuations in Mexico
and South America during the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to improved
gross margins from our European, South American, and Mexican operations and overall increased direct labor utilization and lower bad debt expenses. This increase was partially offset by increased
overhead expenses associated with the growth of these emerging businesses.

Corporate and Other

The Corporate and Other segment is comprised of results from operations not discussed above, including our digital archiving services, PC/Desktop computing
electronic vaulting services, consulting


and
fulfillment operations and costs associated with our corporate headquarters' operations. Certain costs incurred by our Corporate division were allocated to the other segments in 2002, 2003, and
2004, primarily to our Business Records Management and Data Protection segments. These allocations, which include rent, worker's compensation, property, general liability, auto and other insurance,
pension/medical costs, incentive compensation, real estate property taxes and provision for bad debts, are based on rates set at the beginning of each year.

Revenue
in our Corporate and Other segment increased $21.2 million to $51.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $4.6 million to
$29.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Contribution decreased $2.2 million to
$30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and increased $15.8 million to $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $16.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 2002. Items excluded from the calculation of Contribution include the following: (1) depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2003, and 2004 of $21.4 million, $29.4 million, and $32.6 million, respectively, (2) foreign currency gains of $3.4 million,
$1.3 million, and $8.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively, (3) debt extinguishment expense of $5.4 million,
$15.6 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively, and (4) a $0.8 million and $0.7 million loss on
disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively.

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $305.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $288.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2003. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in operating income and non-cash items, such as depreciation offset by the net change in assets and liabilities. The net change in
assets and liabilities is primarily associated with growth in revenues and the resulting increase in receivables, growth in deferred revenue from selling efforts in our digital businesses, an increase
in days sales outstanding in our European operations and increased purchase reserve payments year over year.

We
have made significant capital expenditures, additions to customer relationship and acquisition costs and other investments, primarily acquisitions. Our capital expenditures are
primarily related to growth and include investments in storage systems, information systems and discretionary investments in real estate. Cash paid for our capital expenditures and additions to
customer relationship and acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2004 amounted to $232.0 million and $12.5 million, respectively. For the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, capital expenditures, net and additions to customer relationship and acquisition costs were funded entirely with cash flows provided by operating activities.
Excluding acquisitions, we expect our capital expenditures to be between approximately $220 million and approximately $250 million in the year ending December 31, 2005.

In
the year ended December 31, 2004, we paid net cash consideration of $384.3 million for acquisitions, which included $111.7 million associated with the purchase of
Mentmore's 49.9% equity interest in IME and approximately $109 million (net of cash acquired) to acquire Connected. Cash


flows
from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and net proceeds from other financing transactions funded these acquisitions. Since December 31, 2004, we completed 6
acquisitions for total consideration of approximately $15 million. We also closed on two transactions to buy out minority interest partners in our Latin American subsidiaries for total
consideration of $19 million. These transactions will be reflected in our consolidated statement of cash flows in the first quarter of 2005.

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $276.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2004 we had gross borrowings
under our revolving credit facilities and term loan facilities of $1,148.3 million and we received net proceeds of $269.4 million from the issuance of our 7


/


% GBP Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2014 ("7


/


% notes"). We used the proceeds from these financing transactions to repay debt and term loans ($1,085.0 million), retire notes of our principal

These
debt instruments are collectively referred to as the "Parent Notes." The Parent notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by substantially
all of our direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The remainder of our subsidiaries do not
guarantee the Parent notes or the IMI revolving credit facility and IMI term loan facility.

Our
indentures use OIBDA-based calculations as primary measures of financial performance, including leverage ratios. Our key bond leverage ratio, as calculated per our bond indentures,
was 5.0 as of December 31, 2003 and 2004. Noncompliance with this leverage ratio would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. Our target for this ratio is
generally in the range of 4.5 to 5.5 while the maximum ratio allowable under the bond indentures is 6.5.

Our
ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic,
financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that
future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness, or to make necessary capital expenditures.


Our
indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants including covenants that restrict our ability to complete
acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our
debt rating would not trigger a default under our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with all material debt covenants and
agreements.

In
January 2004, we completed an offering of 150 million British pounds sterling in aggregate principal amount of our 7


/


% notes, which were issued at a price of
100.0% of par. Our net proceeds of 146.9 million British pounds sterling (approximately $270 million), after paying the initial purchasers' discounts, commissions and transaction fees,
were used to fund our acquisition of Mentmore's 49.9% equity interest in IME for total consideration of 82.5 million British pounds sterling (approximately $154 million), to redeem
$20.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Subsidiary notes in February 2004, to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility, to repay $48.8 million
of our term loans, to repay other indebtedness and to pay for other acquisitions.

In
February 2004, using proceeds from our January 2004 offering of 7


/


% notes, we redeemed the remaining $20 million of outstanding principal amount of the
Subsidiary notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 104.063%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge of approximately $2 million to other
(income) expense, net in the first quarter of 2004 related to the early retirement of these remaining Subsidiary notes, which consists of redemption premiums and transaction costs as well as original
issue discount related to these Subsidiary notes.

In
February 2004, we completed the acquisition of the 49.9% equity interest held by Mentmore in IME for total consideration of 82.5 million British pounds sterling (approximately
$154 million) in cash from proceeds of our 7


/


% notes issued in January 2004. Included in this amount is the repayment of all trade and working capital funding owed to
Mentmore by IME. Completion of the transaction gave us 100% ownership of IME, affording us full access to all future cash flows and greater strategic and financial flexibility.

In
March 2004, IME and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the "IME Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of European lenders. The IME Credit Agreement provides
for maximum borrowing availability in the principal amount of 210 million British pounds sterling, including a 100 million British pounds sterling revolving credit facility (the "IME
revolving credit facility"), which includes the ability to borrow in certain other foreign currencies, a 100 million British pounds sterling term loan (the "IME term loan facility"), and a
10 million British pounds sterling overdraft protection line. The IME revolving credit facility matures on March 5, 2009. The IME term loan facility is payable in three installments; two
installments of 20 million British pounds sterling on March 5, 2007 and 2008, respectively, and the final payment of the remaining balance on March 5, 2009. The interest rate on
borrowings under the IME Credit Agreement varies depending on IME's choice of currency options and interest rate period, plus an applicable margin. The IME Credit Agreement includes various financial
covenants applicable to the results of IME, which may restrict IME's ability to incur indebtedness under the IME Credit Agreement and from third parties, as well as limit IME's ability to pay
dividends to us. Most of IME's non-dormant subsidiaries have either guaranteed the obligations or have their shares pledged to secure IME's obligations under the IME Credit Agreement.
We have not guaranteed or otherwise provided security for the IME Credit Agreement nor have any of our U.S., Canadian, Mexican or South American subsidiaries.

In
March 2004, IME borrowed approximately 147 million British pounds sterling under the IME Credit Agreement, including the full amount of the term loan. IME used those proceeds
to repay us 135 million British pounds sterling related to our initial financing of the acquisition of the European operations of Hays IMS, to repay amounts outstanding under its prior term
loan and revolving credit facility and to pay transaction costs associated with the IME Credit Agreement. We used the


135 million
British pounds sterling received from IME to: (1) pay down approximately $104 million of real estate term loans, (2) settle all obligations totaling
$27.7 million associated with terminating our two cross currency swaps used to hedge the foreign currency impact of our intercompany financing with IME related to the Hays IMS acquisition and
(3) to pay down amounts outstanding under our prior credit agreement. The IME Credit Agreement in conjunction with our 7


/


% notes provided permanent financing for the Hays IMS
acquisition and allowed us to maintain the economics of the transaction with respect to exchange rates as originally contemplated at the time of the acquisition. Our consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2004 included 155.1 million British pounds sterling (approximately $285.8 million) of borrowings under the IME Credit Agreement. The remaining availability, based on
its current level of external debt and the leverage ratio under the IME revolving credit facility on October 31, 2004, was approximately 49.0 million British pounds sterling
(approximately $90.2 million).

On
April 2, 2004 and subsequently on July 8, 2004, we entered into a new amended and restated credit facility and term loan facility (the "IMI Credit Agreement") to replace
our prior credit agreement and to reflect more favorable pricing of our term loans. The IMI Credit Agreement has an aggregate principal amount of $550.0 million and is comprised of a
$350.0 million revolving credit facility (the "IMI revolving credit facility"), which includes the ability to borrow in certain foreign currencies, and a $200.0 million term loan
facility (the "IMI term loan facility"). The IMI revolving credit facility matures on April 2, 2009. With respect to the IMI term loan facility, quarterly loan payments of $0.5 million
began in the third quarter of 2004 and will continue through maturity on April 2, 2011, at which time the remaining outstanding principal balance of the IMI term loan facility is due. The
interest rate on borrowings under the IMI Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin. All intercompany notes and the capital stock
of most of our U.S. subsidiaries are pledged to secure the IMI Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2004, we had $122.6 million of borrowings under the IMI revolving credit facility, of
which $3 million was denominated in U.S. dollars and the remaining balance was denominated in Canadian dollars (CAD 144.0 million); we also had various outstanding letters of credit
totaling $22.1 million. The remaining availability, based on IMI's current level of external debt and the leverage ratio under the IMI revolving credit facility, on December 31, 2004 was
$205.3 million. In November 2004, we entered into an additional $150.0 million of term loans as permitted under our IMI Credit Agreement. The new term loans will mature at the
same time as our current IMI term loan facility with quarterly loan payments of $0.4 million beginning in the first quarter of 2005 and are priced at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.75%. As a result,
the IMI Credit Agreement has an aggregate maximum principal amount of $700 million as of December 31, 2004. The interest rate in effect under the IMI revolving credit facility was 4.6%
as of December 31, 2004.

In
April 2004, IME entered into two floating for fixed interest rate swap contracts, each with a notional value of 50.0 million British pounds sterling and a duration of two
years, which were designated as cash flow hedges. These swap agreements hedge interest rate risk on IME's term loan facility.

Our
variable interest entities were financed with real estate term loans. In March 2004, approximately $104 million of these real estate term loans was repaid. In
August 2004, we repaid the remaining $98.7 million of real estate term loans held by one of our variable interest entities using available borrowing capacity under the IMI revolving
credit facility. As a result, we recorded a charge of $9.5 million due to recharacterization of the interest rate swaps associated with these real estate term loans during 2004. This charge
represents the fair market value of the swap, which is a calculation of the net present value of the expected monthly cash payments over the remaining term of the swap based on current market
conditions, as of the date the real estate term loan was repaid. We did not terminate the swap and expect to enjoy the benefit of the fixed rate financing and will continue to mark to market the fair
market value of the derivative liability to interest expense, net and make our


monthly
cash payments as required under the swap contract for the remaining term of approximately three years. See Notes 4 and 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The
IME Credit Agreement, IMI Credit Agreement and our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including
covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not
contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the IME Credit Agreement and IMI Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with all material debt
covenants as of December 31, 2004.

In
addition, in connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn-out obligations that would be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain
operational objectives. These payments are based on the future results of these operations and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn-out payments we would be required to make under
all such agreements as of December 31, 2004 is approximately $16.8 million.

We
expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, borrowings under
the IMI revolving credit facility and other financings, which may include secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. See Notes 5, 10 and 13 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 303(a)(4)(ii).

Net Operating Loss Carryforwards

At December 31, 2004, we had estimated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $170 million for federal income tax purposes. As a result
of such loss carryforwards, cash paid for income taxes has historically been substantially lower than the provision for income taxes. These net operating loss carryforwards do not include
approximately $103 million of potential preacquisition net operation loss carryforwards of Arcus Group, Inc. ("Arcus Group"). Any tax benefit realized related to preacquisition net
operating loss carryforwards will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill when, and if,


realized.
The Arcus Group carryforwards begin to expire next year. As a result of these loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay any significant international, U.S. federal and state income taxes
in 2005.

Seasonality

Historically, our businesses have not been subject to seasonality in any material respect.

Inflation

Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary
pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long-term real estate leases,
we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Interest Rate Risk

Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long term, fixed interest
rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long term returns on invested capital. We target a range 80% to 85% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates.
Occasionally, we will use floating to fixed interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. As part of this strategy, in December 2000, January 2001,
May 2001, and April 2004 we, IME, and variable interest entities we now consolidate, entered into a total of six derivative financial contracts, which are
variable-for-fixed interest rate swaps consisting of (a) two contracts for interest payments payable on the IMI term loan facility of an aggregate principal amount of
$195.5 million, (b) one contract based on interest payments previously payable on our real estate term loans of an aggregate principal amount of $47.5 million that have been
subsequently repaid, (c) one contract based on interest payments previously payable on our real estate term loans of an aggregate principal amount of $97.0 million that have been
subsequently repaid, and (d) two contracts for interest payments payable on IME's term loan facility of an aggregate principal amount of 100.0 million British pounds sterling. See
Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies"
in this Form 10-K.

After
consideration of the swap contracts mentioned above, as of December 31, 2004, we had $275.3 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable
interest rate of 5.1%, and $2,202.8 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2004, 89% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. If the weighted average variable
interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 would have been reduced by $1.5 million. See Note 5 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of
December 31, 2004.

Currency Risk

Our investments in IME, Iron Mountain Canada Corporation ("IM Canada"), Iron Mountain Mexico, SA de RL de CV, IMSA and other international investments may be
subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the U..S. dollar. However, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the
currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. The currencies of many Latin American countries, particularly the Argentine peso, have
experienced substantial volatility and


depreciation.
Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar-denominated liabilities to
increase in local currency. The impact on our earnings is mitigated somewhat by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. We also have several
intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and Iron Mountain and our U.S.-based subsidiaries. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the
foreign subsidiary.

We
have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. One strategy is to finance our largest international
subsidiaries with local debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. In determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies
among other factors. Another strategy we utilize is to borrow in foreign currencies at the U.S. parent level to hedge our intercompany financing activities. Finally, on occasion, we enter into
currency swaps to temporarily hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to lock in certain transaction economics, while we arrange permanent financing. We have implemented these
strategies for our two major foreign investments in the U.K. and Canada. Specifically, through IME borrowing under the IME Credit Agreement and our 150 million British pounds sterling
denominated 7


/


% senior subordinated notes, which effectively hedges most of our outstanding intercompany loan with IME. With respect to Canada, in August 2004, we repaid the
remaining $98.7 million of real estate term loans by having IM Canada draw on its portion of the IMI revolving credit facility in local currency and repaying a portion of its intercompany loan
back to the U.S. parent. This has created a natural hedge on a portion of the intercompany balance and will reduce our currency fluctuations with regard to our investment in IM Canada while providing
IM Canada with additional borrowings and interest expenses to reduce its
income tax burden. As of December 31, 2004, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are unhedged.

The
impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and/or reduce expenses.
Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect
of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items" component of shareholders' equity. A 10% depreciation in
year-end 2004 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction in our shareholders' equity of approximately $20 million.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The information required by this item is included in Item 15 (a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

The term "disclosure controls and procedures" is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. These rules refer to
the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within required time periods. As of December 31, 2004 (the "Evaluation Date"), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.


Based
upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring
that required information will be disclosed on a timely basis in our reports filed under the Exchange Act.

We
continue to strive to give our shareholders as much information as possible to allow them to make their own judgments regarding our performance. In that spirit, we are providing an
update to our disclosure in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004 filed with the SEC on November 9, 2004. In that report, we
disclosed a material change to our European internal controls over financial reporting related to the Hays integration which had resulted in the relocation of our United Kingdom accounting operations
center. We have since completed our internal testing of controls and concluded that, as of the December 31, 2004, controls over financial reporting were effective.

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2004 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 9B. Other Information.

None.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Iron Mountain Incorporated:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Iron Mountain Incorporated (a Pennsylvania corporation) and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the
financial statements of Iron Mountain Europe Limited (a consolidated subsidiary) as of or for the two years ended October 31, 2003, which statements reflect total assets constituting 18% of
consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2003, and total revenues constituting 12% and 7% of the total consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Such financial statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Iron Mountain Europe
Limited for 2003 and 2002, is based solely on the report of such other auditors.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Iron
Mountain Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated March 11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004. Our
management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Iron Mountain Incorporated:

We
have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Iron Mountain Incorporated and subsidiaries
(the "Company") maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


In
our opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion,
the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal

IRON MOUNTAIN INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2004

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

1. Nature of Business

The accompanying financial statements represent the consolidated accounts of Iron Mountain Incorporated, a Pennsylvania corporation, and its subsidiaries. We are
an international full-service provider of information storage and protection and related services for all media in various locations throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, Mexico
and South America to numerous legal, banking, health care, accounting, insurance, entertainment and government organizations, including more than 95% of the Fortune 1000 and more than two-thirds of
the FTSE 100.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

a.     Principles
of Consolidation

The
accompanying financial statements reflect our financial position and results of operations on a consolidated basis. Financial position and results of operations of Iron Mountain
Europe Limited ("IME"), our European subsidiary, are consolidated for the appropriate periods based on its fiscal year ended October 31. All significant intercompany account balances have been
eliminated or presented to reflect the underlying economics of the transactions.

b.     Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates, judgments and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for
the period then ended. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the estimates used, including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos, impairments of tangible and
intangible assets, income taxes, purchase accounting related reserves, self-insurance liabilities, incentive compensation liabilities, litigation liabilities and contingencies. We base our
estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. We use these estimates to assist us in the identification and assessment of the
accounting treatment necessary with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

c.     Cash
and Cash Equivalents

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on hand and cash invested in short-term securities which have remaining maturities at the date of purchase of less than 90 days.
Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.

d.     Foreign
Currency Translation

Local
currencies are considered the functional currencies for most of our operations outside the United States. All assets and liabilities are translated at period-end
exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the applicable period, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 52,
"Foreign Currency Translation." Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items


component
of shareholders' equity. The gain or loss on foreign currency transactions, including those related to (a) U.S. dollar denominated 8


/


% senior notes of our Canadian
subsidiary (the "Subsidiary notes"), (b) our 7


/


% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 (the "7


/


% notes"), (c) the borrowings in certain foreign
currencies under our revolving credit agreements, and (d) the foreign currency denominated intercompany obligations of our foreign subsidiaries to us, are included in other (income) expense,
net, on our consolidated statements of operations. The total of such net gains amounted to $5,043, $30,223 and $8,915 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.

e.     Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

SFAS
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," requires that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a
liability measured at its fair value. Periodically, we acquire derivative instruments that are intended to hedge either cash flows or values which are subject to foreign exchange or other market price
risk, and not for trading purposes. We have formally documented our hedging relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management
objectives and strategies for undertaking each hedge transaction. Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use
long term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby preserving our long term returns on invested capital. We target a range 80% to 85% of our debt portfolio to be long term and fixed
with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we will use floating to fixed interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. In addition, we will use borrowings in
foreign currencies, either obtained in the U.S. or by our foreign subsidiaries, to naturally hedge foreign currency risk associated with our international investments. Sometimes we enter into currency
swaps to temporarily hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition, while we arrange permanent financing.

f.      Property,
Plant and Equipment

Property,
plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method with the following useful lives:

Buildings

40 to 50 years

Leasehold improvements

8 to 10 years or the life of the lease, whichever is shorter

Racking

5 to 20 years

Warehouse equipment

3 to 9 years

Vehicles

5 to 10 years

Furniture and fixtures

2 to 5 years

Computer hardware and software

3 to 5 years


Property,
plant and equipment, at cost, consist of the following:

2,266,839

Minor
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Major improvements which extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or the efficiency of property
owned are capitalized. Major improvements to leased buildings are capitalized as leasehold improvements and depreciated.

We
develop various software applications for internal use. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal
use computer software projects (to the extent of the time spent directly on the project) are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the
design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in
service.

We
apply the provisions of Statement of Position 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use" ("SOP 98-1") which
requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met.. SOP 98-1 also defines which types of costs
should be capitalized and which should be expensed. The computer software costs incurred and capitalized are being depreciated over their useful lives or the useful lives of the related assets.

g.     Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

Effective
July 1, 2001 and January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets," respectively. SFAS No. 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method. Under SFAS No. 142,
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets
that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives.

Effective
January 1, 2002, we reviewed goodwill for impairment consistent with the guidelines of SFAS No. 142 using a discounted future cash flow approach to approximate
fair value. The result of testing our goodwill for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, as of January 1, 2002, was a non-cash charge of $6,396 (net of minority
interest of $8,487), which, consistent with SFAS No. 142, is reported in the caption "cumulative effect of change in accounting principle" in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations. Impairment adjustments recognized in the future, if any, are


generally
required to be recognized as operating expenses. The $6,396 charge relates to our South American reporting unit within our international reporting segment. The South American reporting unit
failed the impairment test primarily due to a reduction in the expected future performance of the unit resulting from a deterioration of the local economic environment and the devaluation of the
currency in Argentina. As goodwill amortization expense in our South American reporting unit is not deductible for tax purposes, this impairment charge is not net of a tax benefit. We have a
controlling 50.1% interest in Iron Mountain South America, Ltd. ("IMSA") and the remainder is owned by an unaffiliated entity. IMSA has acquired a controlling interest in entities in which
local partners have retained a minority interest in order to enhance our local market expertise. These local partners have no ownership interest in IMSA. This has caused the minority interest portion
of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge ($8,487) to exceed our portion of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge ($6,396). In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we
selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2003 and 2004 and noted no impairment of goodwill at
our reporting units as of such dates. As of December 31, 2004, no factors were identified that would alter this assessment.

The
changes in the carrying value of goodwill attributable to each reportable operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 is as follows:

h.     Long-Lived
Assets

In
accordance with SFAS No. 144, we review long-lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets (excluding goodwill) for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation
to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to
be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long-lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value
is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets.

Consolidated
losses on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $774 in the year ended December 31, 2002 consisted of disposals and asset writedowns partially
offset by a $2,091 gain on the sale of a property in the U.K. Consolidated losses on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $1,130 in the year ended December 31, 2003
consisted of disposals and asset writedowns partially offset by approximately $4,200 of gains on the sale of properties in Texas, Florida and the U.K. Consolidated gains on disposal/writedown of
property, plant and equipment, net of $681 for the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted primarily of a gain on the sale of a property in Florida during the second quarter of 2004 of
approximately $1,200 offset by disposals and asset writedowns.

i.      Customer
Relationships and Acquisition Costs and Other

In
connection with adopting SFAS No. 142, we reassessed the useful lives and classification of our intangible assets. Costs related to the acquisition of large volume accounts,
net of revenues received for the initial transfer of the records, are capitalized and amortized for periods ranging from five to 30 years (weighted average of 28 years at
December 31, 2004). These costs had previously been amortized over periods not to exceed 12 years. If the customer terminates its relationship with us, the unamortized cost is charged to
expense. However, in the event of such termination, we collect, and record as income, permanent removal fees that generally equal or exceed the amount of the unamortized costs. Customer relationship
intangible assets acquired through business combinations are amortized over periods ranging from five to 30 years (weighted average of 18 years at December 31, 2004). As of
December 31, 2003 and 2004, the gross carrying amount of customer relationships and acquisition costs was $131,294 and $213,378, respectively, and accumulated amortization of those costs


was
$14,828 and $23,598, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, amortization expense was $1,770, $4,395 and $10,044, respectively.

Other
intangible assets, including noncompetition agreements, acquired core technology and trademarks, are capitalized and amortized over a weighted average period of six years. As of
December 31, 2003 and 2004, the gross carrying amount of other intangible assets was $22,212 and $26,410, respectively, and accumulated amortization of those costs was $20,280 and $9,447,
respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, amortization expense was $3,046, $2,559 and $1,638, respectively.

j.      Deferred
Financing Costs

Deferred
financing costs are amortized over the life of the related debt using the effective interest rate method. If debt is retired early, the related unamortized deferred financing
costs are written off in the period the debt is retired to other (income) expense, net. As of December 31, 2003 and 2004, gross carrying amount of deferred financing costs was $29,620 and
$46,231, respectively, and accumulated amortization of those costs was $5,686 and $9,641, respectively, and was recorded in interest expense, net.

k.     Investment
in Preferred Stock

In
May 2000, we made a $6,500 investment in the convertible preferred stock of LiveVault Corporation, a technology development company. This investment is accounted for at the
lower of cost or market. In September 2001, we recorded an impairment charge in other (income) expense, net of $6,900, including the original investment and certain loans related to such
investment. In December 2001, in connection with a recapitalization of LiveVault, we made an additional $2,000 investment in LiveVault's convertible preferred stock. In December 2002, we
recorded an impairment charge related to this investment in other (income) expense, net of $600. In March 2003 and October 2004, we made additional investments of $1,357 and $858,
respectively, in LiveVault's convertible preferred stock. As of December 31, 2003 and 2004, $2,757 and $3,615, respectively, of carrying value related to this investment is included in other
assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

m.    Revenues

Our
revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service and storage material sales revenues. Storage revenues consist of periodic charges related to the storage of materials (either
on a per unit or per cubic foot of records basis). In certain circumstances, based upon customer requirements, storage revenues include periodic charges associated with normal, recurring service
activities. Service and storage material sales revenues are comprised of charges for related service activities and courier operations and the sale of storage materials. Customers are generally billed
on a monthly basis on contractually agreed-upon terms.

Storage
and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective service is provided. Storage material sales are recognized when shipped to the customer. Amounts related to future
storage for customers where storage fees are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and amortized over the applicable period.

n.     Rent
Normalization

We
have entered into various leases for buildings used in the storage of records. Certain leases have fixed escalation clauses or other features which require normalization of the rental
expense over the life of the lease resulting in deferred rent being reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. In addition, we have assumed various above and below market leases in connection with certain of our acquisitions. The difference between the present value of these lease obligations and the
market rate at the date of the acquisition was recorded as a prepaid rent or deferred rent liability and is being amortized over the remaining lives of the respective leases.

o.     Stock-based
Compensation

As
of January 1, 2003, we adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure." As a result we began using the fair value method of accounting in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the
prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for
previous awards. Additionally, we recognize expense related to the discount embedded in our employee stock purchase plan. We will apply the fair value recognition provisions to all stock based awards
granted, modified or settled on or after January 1, 2003 and will continue to provide the required pro forma information for all awards previously granted, modified or settled before
January 1, 2003.


Had
we elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of the options granted at grant date as prescribed by SFAS No. 123 and No. 148, net income and net
income per share would have been changed to the pro forma amounts indicated in the table below:

p.     Merger-related
Expenses

Merger-related
expenses as presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relate primarily to non-capitalizable expenses directly related to our merger with
Pierce Leahy Corp. and consist primarily of severance, relocation and pay-to-stay payments, costs of exiting certain facilities, system conversion costs and other
transaction-related costs.

q.     Income
Taxes

We
account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when
recovery of deferred tax assets is not considered likely.


r.     Income
Per Share—Basic and Diluted

In
accordance with SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share," basic net income per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. The calculation of diluted net income per share is consistent with that of basic net income per share but gives effect to all potential common shares (that is, securities such as options,
warrants or convertible securities) that were outstanding during the period, unless the effect is antidilutive. Potential common shares, substantially attributable to stock options, included in the
calculation of diluted net income per share totaled 2,130,983, 2,177,201 and 2,092,831 shares for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Potential common shares of
475,296, 570,456 and 91,045 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively, have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share, as their effects are
antidilutive.

s.     New
Accounting Pronouncements

In
December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment." SFAS No. 123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123
and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB No. 25"). We adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 and
SFAS No. 148 in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards
granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. We have applied the fair value recognition provisions to all stock based awards granted,
modified or settled on or after January 1, 2003.

Among
other items, SFAS No. 123R eliminates the use of APB No. 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting, and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee
services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the financial statements. The effective date of SFAS No. 123R is the first
reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, which would be our third quarter of 2005, although early adoption is allowed. SFAS No. 123R permits companies to adopt its requirements
using either a "modified prospective" method, or a "modified retrospective" method. Under the "modified prospective" method, compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with
the effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all share-based payments granted after that date, and based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all unvested awards
granted prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123R. Under the "modified retrospective" method, the requirements are the same as under the "modified prospective" method, but this method also
permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with SFAS No. 123.

SFAS
No. 123R also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an
operating cash flow as required under current rules. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date. Since we do not
pay significant cash taxes currently, we do not expect this provision to materially impact our statement of cash flows within the next few years.


We
expect to adopt SFAS No. 123R effective July 1, 2005 using the modified prospective method of implementation. Subject to a complete review of the requirements of SFAS
No. 123R, based on outstanding stock options granted to employees prior to our prospective implementation of the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148 on
January 1, 2003, we expect to record approximately $900 of stock compensation expense in the second half of 2005 associated with unvested stock option grants issued prior to January 1,
2003.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 109-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004" ("FSP 109-2"). The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("AJCA") introduces a special one-time dividends received deduction on the
repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer ("repatriation provision"), provided certain criteria are met. FSP 109-2 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the
repatriation provision. The Treasury Department or Congress will be providing additional clarifying language on key elements of the repatriation provision in the future. FSP 109-2 grants
an enterprise additional time beyond the year ended December 31, 2004, in which the AJCA was enacted, to evaluate the effects of the AJCA on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of
unremitted earnings. FSP 109-2 calls for enhanced disclosures of, among other items, the status of our evaluations, the effects of completed evaluations, and the potential range of income
tax effects of repatriations. Such disclosures are included in Note 10.

3. Variable Interest Entities

Three variable interest entities were established to acquire properties and lease those properties to us. These leases were designed to qualify as operating
leases for accounting purposes, where the monthly lease expense was recorded as rent expense in our consolidated statements of operations and where the related underlying assets and liabilities were
not consolidated in our consolidated balance sheets. We changed the characterization and the related accounting for properties in one variable interest entity ("VIE III") during the third quarter of
2002 and prospectively for new property acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2002. In addition, anticipating the requirement to consolidate, and in line with our objective of transparent reporting,
we voluntarily guaranteed all of the at-risk equity in VIE III and our two other variable interest entities (together, the "Other Variable Interest Entities" and, collectively with VIE
III, our "Variable Interest Entities") as of December 31, 2002. These guarantees resulted in our consolidating all of our Variable Interest Entities' assets and liabilities. The underlying
leases associated with the Other Variable Interest Entities were treated as operating leases from inception (as early as 1998) through consolidation on December 31, 2002. As a result, we
recorded $5,915 in rent expense in our consolidated statement of operations related to these leases for the year ended December 31, 2002. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004,
we recorded depreciation expense of $2,001 for each year associated with the properties, and interest expense of $5,464 and $2,014, respectively, associated with the real estate term loans which were
repaid in March 2004. We no longer have rent expense related to leases associated with the Other Variable Interest Entities in our consolidated financial results.

4. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We have entered into two interest rate swap agreements, which are derivatives as defined by SFAS No. 133 and designated as cash flow hedges. These swap
agreements hedge interest rate risk on certain amounts of our term loan. For all qualifying and highly effective cash flow hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in
other comprehensive income (loss). Specifically, we chose to swap the interest rates on $195,500 of floating rate debt to fixed rate. Since entering into these two swap agreements, interest rates have
fallen. As a result, the estimated cost to terminate these swaps (fair value of derivative liability) would be $13,370 and $4,333 at December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. We have recorded,
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, the fair value of the


derivative
liability, a deferred tax asset and a corresponding charge to accumulated other comprehensive items of $13,370 ($8,709 recorded in accrued expenses and $4,661 recorded in other
long-term liabilities), $4,878 and $8,492, respectively, as of December 31, 2003. We have recorded, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, the fair value of the derivative
liability, a deferred tax asset and a corresponding charge to accumulated other comprehensive items of $4,333 ($2,910 recorded in accrued expenses and $1,423 recorded in other long-term
liabilities), $1,585 and $2,748, respectively, as of December 31, 2004. Additionally, as a result of the foregoing, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, we recorded
additional interest expense of $7,534, $8,709 and $8,460 resulting from interest rate swap payments. These interest rate swap agreements were determined to be highly effective, and therefore no
ineffectiveness was recorded in earnings.

In
addition, we have entered into a third interest rate swap agreement, which was designated as a cash flow hedge through December 31, 2002. This swap agreement hedged interest
rate risk on certain amounts of our variable operating lease commitments. Specifically, we chose to swap the variable component of $47,500 of certain operating lease commitments to fixed operating
lease commitments. Since entering into the swap agreement, interest rates have fallen. As a result, the estimated cost to terminate these swaps (fair value of derivative liability) would be $1,250 and
$140 at December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. We have recorded, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, the estimated cost to terminate this swap (fair value of the derivative
liability) of $140 (which was all recorded in accrued expenses) as of December 31, 2004. From inception through December 31, 2002, this interest rate swap agreement was determined to be
highly effective, and therefore no ineffectiveness was recorded in earnings. As a result of the consolidation of one of the Other Variable Interest Entities ("VIE I") on December 31, 2002, we
consolidated the real estate term loans of VIE I and the operating lease commitments that were hedged by this swap are now considered to be inter-company transactions. As a result, this interest rate
swap agreement was deemed to be no longer effective on a prospective basis. The unrealized mark to market losses previously recorded in other comprehensive income attributable to this swap ($1,875,
net of tax, as of December 31, 2002) will be amortized through other (income) expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations based on the changes in the fair value of the
swap each period that the remaining interest payments are made on VIE I's real estate term loans. We will prospectively account for mark to market changes in the derivative liability of this swap
through other (income) expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. This accounting will have a net zero impact within our consolidated statement of operations as it relates
to the amortization of unrealized mark to market losses and the fair valuing of the derivative liability. Additionally, as a result of the foregoing, for the year ended December 31, 2002, we
recorded additional rent expense of $1,807, resulting from the payments associated with this interest rate swap agreement and for the year ended December 31, 2003 we recorded additional
interest expense of $2,083 resulting from payments associated with this interest rate swap agreement. As a result of the repayment of the real estate term loans discussed in Note 5, we recorded
an additional $795 of interest in the first quarter of 2004, representing the fair value of the derivative liability. The total impact of marking to market the fair market value of the derivative
liability and cash payments associated with the interest rate swaps agreement resulted in our recording additional interest expense of $1,246 for the year ended December 31, 2004.


Also,
as of December 31, 2002, we consolidated VIE III which had entered into an interest rate swap agreement upon its inception which was designated as a cash flow hedge. This
swap agreement hedges the majority of interest rate risk associated with VIE III's real estate term loans. Specifically, VIE III has swapped $97,000 of floating rate debt to fixed rate debt. Since the
time it entered into the swap agreement, interest rates have fallen. As a result, the estimated cost to terminate these swaps (fair value of derivative liability) would be $10,960 and $6,934 at
December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. We have recorded, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, the estimated cost to terminate this swap (fair value of the derivative liability) of
$6,934 ($4,100 recorded in accrued expenses and $2,834 recorded in other long-term liabilities) as of December 31, 2004. Additionally, as a result of the foregoing, for the year
ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, we recorded additional interest expense of $3,423 and $4,806, respectively, resulting from interest rate swap payments. As a result of the repayment of the
real estate term loans discussed in Note 5, we recorded an additional $8,656 of interest in the third quarter of 2004, representing the fair value of the derivative liability. The total impact
of marking to market the fair market value of the derivative liability and cash payments
associated with the interest rate swap agreement resulted in our recording additional interest expense of $11,565 for the year ended December 31, 2004.

In
July 2003, we provided the initial financing totaling 190,459 British pounds sterling to IME for all of the consideration associated with the acquisition of the European
information management services business of Hays plc ("Hays IMS") using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We recorded a foreign currency gain of $27,777 in other
(income) expense, net for this intercompany balance for the year ended December 31, 2003. In March 2004, IME repaid 135,000 British pounds sterling with proceeds from their new credit
agreement (see Note 5). We recorded a foreign currency gain of $11,866 in other (income) expense, net for this intercompany balance in the first quarter of 2004. In order to minimize the
foreign currency risk associated with providing IME with the consideration necessary for the acquisition of the European operations of Hays IMS, we borrowed 80,000 British pounds sterling under our
revolving credit facility to create a natural hedge. We recorded a foreign currency loss of $11,496 on the translation of this revolving credit balance to U.S. dollars in other (income) expense, net
for the year ended December 31, 2003. In the first quarter of 2004, these borrowings were repaid and we recorded a foreign currency loss of $2,995 on the translation of this revolving credit
balance to U.S. dollars in other (income) expense, net.

In
addition, on July 16, 2003, we entered into two cross currency swaps with a combined notional value of 100,000 British pounds sterling. We settled these swaps in
March 2004 by paying our counter parties a total of $27,714 representing the fair market value of the derivative and the associated swap costs, of which $18,978 was accrued for as of
December 31, 2003. In the first quarter of 2004, we recorded a foreign currency loss for this swap of $8,736 in other (income) expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations. Upon cash payment, we received $162,800 in exchange for 100,000 British pounds sterling. We did not designate these swaps as hedges and, therefore, all mark to market fluctuations of the
swaps were recorded in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of operations from inception to cash payment of the swaps.

In
April 2004, IME entered into two floating for fixed interest rate swap contracts, each with a notional value of 50,000 British pounds sterling and a duration of two years, which were
designated as


cash
flow hedges. These swap agreements hedge interest rate risk on IME's 100,000 British pounds sterling term loan facility (see Note 5). We have recorded, in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet, the fair value of the derivative asset, a deferred tax liability and a corresponding increase to accumulated other comprehensive items of $115 (which was all recorded in other current
assets), $39 and $76, respectively, as of December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded additional interest expense of $202 resulting from interest rate swap cash
payments.

a.     Revolving
Credit Facility and Term Loans

In
March 2004, IME and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the "IME Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of European lenders. The IME Credit Agreement provides
for maximum borrowing availability in the principal amount of 210,000 British pounds sterling, including a 100,000 British pounds sterling revolving credit facility (the "IME revolving credit
facility"), which includes the ability to borrow in certain other foreign currencies, a 100,000 British pounds sterling term loan (the "IME term loan facility"), and a 10,000 British pounds sterling
overdraft protection line. The


IME
revolving credit facility matures on March 5, 2009. The IME term loan facility is payable in three installments; two installments of 20,000 British pounds sterling on March 5, 2007
and 2008, respectively, and the final payment of the remaining balance on March 5, 2009. The interest rate on borrowings under the IME Credit Agreement varies depending on IME's choice of
currency options and interest rate period, plus an applicable margin. The IME Credit Agreement includes various financial covenants applicable to the results of IME, which may restrict IME's ability
to incur indebtedness under the IME Credit Agreement and from third parties, as well as limit IME's ability to pay dividends to us. Most of IME's non-dormant subsidiaries have either
guaranteed the obligations or have their shares pledged to secure IME's obligations under the IME Credit Agreement. We have not guaranteed or otherwise provided security for the IME Credit Agreement
nor have any of our U.S., Canadian, Mexican or South American subsidiaries.

In
March 2004, IME borrowed approximately 147,000 British pounds sterling under the IME Credit Agreement, including the full amount of the term loan. IME used those proceeds to repay us
135,000 British pounds sterling related to our initial financing of the acquisition of Hays IMS, to repay amounts outstanding under its prior term loan and revolving credit facility and to pay
transaction costs associated with the IME Credit Agreement. We used the 135,000 British pounds sterling received from IME to: (1) pay down $103,932 of real estate term loans, (2) settle
all obligations totaling $27,714 associated with terminating our two cross currency swaps used to hedge the foreign currency impact of our intercompany financing with IME related to the Hays IMS
acquisition, and (3) to pay down amounts outstanding under our prior credit agreement. Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2004 included 155,052 British pounds sterling
($285,808) of borrowings under the IME Credit Agreement. The remaining availability, based on its current level of external debt and the leverage ratio under the IME revolving credit facility on
October 31, 2004, was approximately 48,951 British pounds sterling ($90,231). The interest rate in effect under the IME revolving credit facility ranged from 3.4% to 6.6% as of
October 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded commitment fees of $396 based on 0.9% of unused balances under the IME revolving credit facility.

On
April 2, 2004 and subsequently on July 8, 2004, we entered into a new amended and restated revolving credit facility and term loan facility (the "IMI Credit Agreement")
to replace our prior credit agreement and to reflect more favorable pricing of our term loans. The IMI Credit Agreement has an aggregate principal amount of $550,000 and is comprised of a $350,000
revolving credit facility (the "IMI revolving credit facility"), which includes the ability to borrow in certain foreign currencies, and a $200,000 term loan facility (the "IMI term loan facility").
The IMI revolving credit facility matures on April 2, 2009. With respect to the IMI term loan facility, quarterly loan payments of $500 began in the third quarter of 2004 and will continue
through maturity on April 2, 2011, at which time the remaining outstanding principal balance of the IMI term loan facility is due. In November 2004, we entered into an additional
$150,000 of term loans as permitted under our IMI Credit Agreement. The new term loans will mature at the same time as our current IMI term loan facility with quarterly loan payments of $375 beginning
in the first quarter of 2005 and will be priced at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.75%. As a result, the IMI Credit Agreement has an aggregate maximum principal amount of $700,000 as of December 31,
2004. The interest rate on borrowings under the IMI Credit Agreement varies depending


on
our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin. All intercompany notes and the capital stock of most of our U.S. subsidiaries are pledged to secure the IMI Credit
Agreement. As of December 31, 2004, we had $122,563 of borrowings under our IMI revolving credit facility, of which $3,000 was denominated in U.S. dollars and the remaining balance was
denominated in Canadian dollars (CAD 144,000); we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $22,099. The remaining availability, based on IMI's current level of external debt and the
leverage ratio under the IMI revolving credit facility, on December 31, 2004 was $205,338. The interest rate in effect under the IMI revolving credit facility was 4.6% as of December 31,
2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded commitment fees of $1,112 based on 0.5% of unused balances under the IMI revolving credit facility.

In
December 2000, we entered into an interest rate swap contract to hedge the risk of changes in market interest rates on our term loan. The instrument is a
variable-for-fixed swap of quarterly interest payments payable on certain amounts of our term loan through 2006. The notional value of the swap equals $99,500 and has a fixed
rate of 5.9% and a variable rate based on periodic three-month London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR). In January 2001, we entered into a second interest rate swap contract on our
term loan. The notional value of the second swap equals $96,000 and has a fixed rate of 5.5% and a variable rate based on periodic three-month LIBOR.. In conjunction with the IMI Credit Agreement,
these interest rate swap contracts hedge the risk of changes in market interest rates on our new term loan due 2011 rather than the previous term loan due 2006.

The
IME Credit Agreement and IMI Credit Agreement contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions,
pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating
would not trigger a default under the IME Credit Agreement and IMI Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with all material debt covenants as of December 31, 2004.

b.     Notes
Issued under Indentures

As
of December 31, 2004, we have five series of senior subordinated notes issued under various indentures, that are obligations of the parent company, Iron Mountain Incorporated
(the "Parent notes"):

•

$150,000
principal amount of notes maturing on July 1, 2011 and bearing interest at a rate of 8


/


% per annum, payable semi-annually in
arrears on January 1 and July 1;

•

$480,874
principal amount of notes maturing on April 1, 2013 and bearing interest at a rate of 8


/


% per annum, payable semi-annually in
arrears on April 1 and October 1;

•

150,000
British pounds sterling principal amount of notes maturing on April 15, 2014 and bearing interest at a rate of 7


/


% per annum, payable
semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15, these notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange;

•

$431,255
principal amount of notes maturing on January 15, 2015 and bearing interest at a rate of 7


/


% per annum, payable semi-annually in
arrears on January 15 and July 15; and


•

$320,000
principal amount of notes maturing on January 1, 2016 and bearing interest at a rate of 6


/


% per annum, payable semi-annually in
arrears on January 1 and July 1.

The
Parent notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the
"Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Parent notes or the IMI Credit Agreement.

In
January 2004, we completed an offering of 150,000 British pounds sterling in aggregate principal amount of our 7


/


% notes, which were issued at a price of 100% of par.
Our net proceeds of 146,900 British pounds sterling ($269,427), after paying the initial purchasers' discounts, commissions and transaction fees, were used to fund our acquisition of the 49.9% equity
interest held by Mentmore in IME for total consideration of 82,500 British pounds sterling ($154,000), to redeem $19,985 in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Subsidiary notes in
February 2004, to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility, to repay $48,750 of our term loans, to repay other indebtedness and to pay for other acquisitions.

In
addition, Iron Mountain Canada Corporation ("IM Canada"), our principal Canadian subsidiary, had publicly issued $135,000 principal amount of senior notes that matured on
May 15, 2008 and bore interest at a rate of 8


/


% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15. The Subsidiary notes were
general unsecured obligations of IM Canada, ranking

pari passu

in right of payment to all of IM Canada's existing and future senior indebtedness. The
Subsidiary notes were fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by Iron Mountain Incorporated and the Guarantors. In addition, several of the non-guarantors
that are organized under the laws of Canadian provinces fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Subsidiary notes on a senior basis. As with the Parent notes, these guarantees were joint and several.
In July 2003, we redeemed $50,000 of outstanding principal amount of the Subsidiary notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 104.063%, plus accrued and
unpaid interest. In December 2003, we redeemed $65,015 of outstanding principal amount of the Subsidiary notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of
104.313%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge to other (income) expense, net of $12,530 in 2003 related to the early retirement of these Subsidiary notes, which consists of
redemption premiums and transaction costs, as well as original issue discount related to these Subsidiary notes. In February 2004, we redeemed the remaining $19,985 of outstanding principal
amount of the Subsidiary notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 104.063%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge to other (income) expense, net
of $2,028 in 2004 related to the early retirement of these remaining Subsidiary notes, which consists of redemption premiums and transaction costs as well as original issue discount related to these
Subsidiary notes.

For
the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded a charge to other (income) expense, net of $5,431 related to the early retirement of debt in conjunction with the refinancing of
the IMI credit facility and 9


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes (the "9


/


% notes"). For the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded a charge to other (income)
expense, net of $28,174 related to the early retirement of 9


/


% notes, 8


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes and the Subsidiary notes.


Each
of the indentures for the notes provides that we may redeem the outstanding notes, in whole or in part, upon satisfaction of certain terms and conditions. In any redemption, we are
also required to pay all accrued but unpaid interest on the outstanding notes.

The
following table presents the various redemption dates and prices of the public notes. The redemption dates reflect the date at or after which the notes may be redeemed at our option
at a premium redemption price. After these dates, the notes may be redeemed at 100% of face value:

Prior
to January 15, 2008, the 7


/


% notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at a specified make-whole price. Prior to
January 15, 2006, we may under certain conditions redeem up to 35% of the 7


/


% notes with the net proceeds of one or more public equity offerings, at a redemption price of
107.750% of the principal amount.

Prior
to July 1, 2008, the 6


/


% notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at a specified make-whole price. Prior to July 1, 2006,
we may under certain conditions redeem 6


/


% notes with the net proceeds of one or more public equity offerings, at a redemption price of 106.625% of the principal amount.

Prior
to April 15, 2009, the 7


/


% notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at a specified make-whole price. Prior to April 15,
2007, we may under certain conditions redeem 7


/


% notes with the net proceeds of one or more public equity offerings, at a redemption price of 107.25% of the principal amount.

Each
of the indentures for the notes provides that we must repurchase, at the option of the holders, the notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon
the occurrence of a "Change of Control," which is defined in each respective indenture. Except for required repurchases upon the occurrence of a Change of Control or in the event of certain asset
sales, each as described in
the respective indenture, we are not required to make sinking fund or redemption payments with respect to any of the notes.

Our
indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants including covenants that restrict our ability to complete
acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate


actions.
The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness. As of
December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with all material debt covenants and agreements.

c.     Real
Estate Term Loans

Our
Variable Interest Entities were financed with real estate term loans. As of December 31, 2003, these real estate term loans amounted to $202,647 bearing interest at various
variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. In March 2004, $103,932 of these real estate term loans was repaid; the remaining $98,715 of real estate term loans was repaid
in August 2004. We recorded a charge to other (income) expense, net of $426 in 2004 related to the early retirement of these real estate term loans.

d.     Real
Estate Mortgages

In
connection with the purchase of real estate and acquisitions, we assumed several mortgages on real property. The mortgages bear interest at rates ranging from 5.5% to 7.6% and are
payable in various installments through 2023.

e.     Seller
Notes

In
connection with the merger with Pierce Leahy in 2000, we assumed debt related to certain existing notes as a result of acquisitions which Pierce Leahy completed in 1999. The notes
bear interest at a rate of 4.75% per year. The outstanding balance of 5,869 British pounds sterling ($11,307) on these notes at December 31, 2004 is due on demand through 2009 and is classified
as a current portion of long-term debt.

f.      Other

Other
long-term debt includes various notes and obligations assumed by us as a result of certain acquisitions. The outstanding balance of $28,694 on these notes at
December 31, 2004 with a weighted average interest rate of 7.9%.

These
debt instruments are collectively referred to as the "Parent notes."

(3)

The
fair values of the Parent notes and the Subsidiary notes are based on quoted market prices for these notes on December 31, 2003 and 2004.

7. Acquisitions

In July 2003, we and IME completed the acquisition of Hays IMS in two simultaneous transactions. IME acquired the European operations of Hays IMS for
aggregate cash consideration (including transaction costs) of approximately 190,000 British pounds sterling ($309,000), while we acquired the U.S. operations of Hays IMS for aggregate cash
consideration (including transaction costs) of approximately 14,500 British pounds sterling ($24,000). Both transactions were on a cash and debt free basis.

In
February 2004, we completed the acquisition of the 49.9% equity interest held by Mentmore in IME for total consideration of 82,500 British pounds sterling ($154,000) in cash.
Included in this amount is the repayment of all trade and working capital funding owed to Mentmore by IME. Completion of the transaction gives us 100% ownership of IME. This transaction did not have
material impact on revenue or operating income since we already fully consolidate IME's financial results. Using the purchase method of accounting for this acquisition, the net assets of IME were
adjusted to reflect 49.9% of the difference between the fair market value and their carrying value on the date of acquisition.

In
November 2004, we acquired Connected Corporation ("Connected") for total cash consideration of $109,326 (net of cash acquired).

Each
of the 2002, 2003 and 2004 acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the results of operations for each acquisition have been
included in our consolidated results from their respective acquisition dates. Cash consideration for the various acquisitions was provided through our credit facilities and the issuance of certain of
our senior subordinated notes.

A
summary of the consideration paid and the allocation of the purchase price of the acquisitions is as follows:

Included
in cash paid for acquisitions in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 is a contingent payment of $7,165,
$1,077 and $5,513, respectively, related to acquisitions made in the previous years.

(2)

Consisted
primarily of accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other, land, buildings, racking, leasehold improvements, and customer relationship assets.


(3)

Consisted
primarily of accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable.

(4)

Consisted
primarily of the carrying value of Mentmore's 49.9% minority interest in IME at the date of acquisition.

Allocation
of the purchase price for the 2004 acquisitions was based on estimates of the fair value of net assets acquired, and is subject to adjustment. The purchase price allocations
of certain 2004 transactions are subject to finalization of the assessment of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets (primarily customer relationship assets), operating
leases, restructuring purchase reserves, deferred revenue and deferred income taxes. We are not aware of any information that would indicate that the final purchase price allocations will differ
meaningfully from preliminary estimates.

In
connection with each of our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses. The restructuring activities include certain reductions in staffing
levels, elimination of duplicate facilities and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the acquired businesses. The estimated cost of these restructuring activities were recorded as
costs of the acquisitions and were provided in accordance with EITF No. 95-3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination." We finalize
restructuring plans for each business no later than one year from the date of acquisition. Unresolved matters at December 31, 2004 primarily include completion of planned abandonments of
facilities and severance contracts in connection with certain acquisitions.

The
following is a summary of reserves related to such restructuring activities:

Includes

At
December 31, 2003, the restructuring reserves related to acquisitions consisted of lease losses on abandoned facilities ($6,849), severance costs for approximately 158 people
($3,593) and move and other exit costs ($5,880). These accruals are expected to be used prior to December 31, 2004 except for lease losses of $4,927 and severance contracts of $314, both of
which are based on contracts that extend beyond one year.

At
December 31, 2004, the restructuring reserves related to acquisitions consisted of lease losses on abandoned facilities ($12,348), severance costs for approximately 56 people
($2,463) and move and other exit costs ($6,603). These accruals are expected to be used prior to December 31, 2005 except for lease losses of $10,560 and severance contracts of $193, both of
which are based on contracts that extend beyond one year.


In
connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn-out obligations that would be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain operational
objectives. These payments are based on the future results of these operations and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn-out payments we would be required to make under all such
agreements as of December 31, 2004 is approximately $16,798.

8. Capital Stock and Stock Options

a.     Capital

9. Discontinued Operations

In June 1999, in order to focus on our information storage and protection services business, we decided to sell our information technology staffing
business, Arcus Staffing Resources, Inc. ("Arcus Staffing"), which was acquired in January 1998 as part of the acquisition of Arcus Group, Inc. Effective November 1, 1999,
we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of Arcus Staffing. In accordance with the provisions of APB No. 30, the sale of Arcus Staffing was accounted for as a discontinued
operation. Accordingly, the Arcus Staffing operations were segregated from our continuing operations and reported as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of operations.

In
1999, we recorded an estimated loss on the sale of Arcus Staffing of $13,400, comprised of a write-off of goodwill, a deferred tax benefit and estimated expenses directly
related to
the transaction partially offset by the estimated income from operations of Arcus Staffing through the date of disposition. In 2002, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $1,116 (net of
tax of $768) related to the reversal of remaining liabilities associated with certain contingencies which have been resolved.

10. Income Taxes

The components of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and minority interest are:

We
have estimated federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2018 through 2021 of $169,900 at December 31, 2004 to reduce future federal taxable income, if
any. The preceding net operating loss carryforwards do not include pre-acquisition net operating loss carryforwards of Arcus Group, Inc. in the amount of approximately $103,000. Any
tax benefit realized related to pre-acquisition net operating loss carryforwards will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill when, and if, realized. The Arcus Group carryforwards begin to
expire next year. We also have estimated state net operating loss carryforwards of $92,568. The state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 55%.
Additionally, we have alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $1,364, which have no expiration date and are available to reduce future income taxes, if any.

We
are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions around the world. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of
business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates for certain tax loss contingencies are reasonable, the
final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additional taxes assessed as a
result of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the


period
or periods in which the determination is made. We revise our estimates of such tax loss contingencies, if and when appropriate.

The
tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented below:

We
receive a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options or upon the disqualifying disposition by employees of incentive stock options and shares acquired
under our employee stock purchase plan for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise or disqualifying disposition. The tax
benefit for non-qualified stock options and the 15% discount associated with our employee stock purchase plan are included in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which
compensation expense is recorded. The tax benefit associated with compensation expense recorded in the consolidated financial statements related to incentive stock options and incremental amounts
recorded above the 15% discount associated with the employee stock purchase plan are recorded in the period the disqualifying disposition occurs. All tax benefits for awards issued prior to
January 1, 2003 and incremental tax benefits in excess of compensation expense recorded in the consolidated financial statements are credited directly to equity and amounted to $4,476, $3,950
and $6,904 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.

We
have not provided deferred taxes on book basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future
and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose primarily through the


undistributed
book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis differences could be reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries as well as certain other
events or actions on our part, which would result in an increase in our provision for income taxes. We currently do not anticipate utilizing the repatriation provision outlined in the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004.

We
file a consolidated federal income tax return with our U.S. subsidiaries. The provision for income taxes consists of the following components:

12. Segment Information

We operate in seven operating segments, based on their economic environment, geographic area, the nature of their services and the nature of their processes:

•

Business
Records Management—throughout the United States and Canada, the storage of paper documents, as well as all other non-electronic media such
as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, X-rays and blueprints,
including healthcare information services, vital records services and service, courier operations, and the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents for corporate customers

•

Data
Protection—the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster and business recovery plans, including service and courier
operations and electronic vaulting services for the server market

•

Fulfillment—the
storage of customer marketing literature and delivery to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers' sites based on current and
prospective customer orders; the assembly of custom marketing packages and orders; the management and detailed reporting on customer marketing literature inventories

•

Digital
Archiving Services—storage and related services for electronic records conveyed via telecommunication lines and the Internet

•

Europe—information
storage and protection services throughout Europe

•

South
America—information storage and protection services throughout South America

•

Mexico—information
storage and protection services throughout Mexico

The
South America and Mexico operating segments do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for a reporting segment, but have been aggregated and reported with Europe as one


reporting
segment, "International," given their similar economic characteristics, products, customers and processes. The Fulfillment and Digital Archiving Services operating segments do not meet the
quantitative thresholds for a reportable segment and thus are included in the "Corporate and Other" category. Corporate items include non-operating overhead, corporate general and
administrative expenses, non-allocated operating expenses and inter-segment eliminations. Corporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents, prepaid items, certain
non-operating fixed assets, deferred income taxes, certain non-trade receivables, certain inter-segment receivables, and deferred financing costs.

Includes
capital expenditures, cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and additions to customer relationship and acquisition costs in the accompanying consolidated
statements of cash flows.

The
accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 2 except that certain costs continue to be allocated from Corporate & Other to
the other segments in 2002, 2003 and 2004, primarily to our Business Records Management and Data Protection segments. These allocations, which include rent, worker's compensation, property, general
liability, auto and other insurance, pension/medical costs, incentive compensation, real estate property taxes and provision for


bad
debts, are based on rates set at the beginning of each year. Contribution for each segment is defined as total revenues less cost of sales (excluding depreciation) and selling, general and
administrative expenses (including the costs allocated to each segment as described above). Internally, we use Contribution as the basis for evaluating the performance of and allocating resources to
our operating segments.

13. Commitments and Contingencies

a.     Leases

We
lease most of our facilities under various operating leases. A majority of these leases have renewal options of five to ten years and have either fixed or Consumer Price Index
escalation clauses. We also lease equipment under operating leases, primarily computers which have an average lease life of three years. Trucks and office equipment are also leased and have remaining
lease lives ranging from one to seven years. Total rent expense under all of our operating leases was $125,866, $134,371 and $163,564 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004,
respectively. There was $5,915 related to synthetic lease facilities included in rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2002. There was no such expense in 2003 and 2004. See
Note 3.

Minimum
future lease payments, net of sublease income of $2,715, $1,933, $1,375, $1,127, $912 and $1,546 for 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and thereafter, respectively, are as follows:

We
have guaranteed the residual value of certain vehicle operating leases to which we are a party. The maximum net residual value guarantee obligation for these vehicles as of
December 31, 2004 was $34,316. Such amount does not take into consideration the recovery or resale value associated with these vehicles. We believe that it is not reasonably likely that we will
be required to perform under these guarantee agreements or that any performance requirement would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

b.     South
Brunswick Fires Litigation

In
March 1997, we experienced three fires, all of which authorities have determined were caused by arson. The fires resulted in damage to one and destruction of another records and
information services facility in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey. Certain of our customers or their insurance carriers asserted claims as a consequence of the destruction of, or damage to, their
records as a result of the fires, including claims with specific requests for compensation and allegations of negligence or other culpability on the part of Iron Mountain. Five lawsuits were filed
against Iron Mountain by certain of our customers and/or their insurers, and a sixth lawsuit was filed by the issuers of an abutter of one of the South Brunswick facilities. As a result of a mediation
in August 2004, the parties to these six lawsuits entered into a written settlement of these matters. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Iron Mountain contributed $500 to a settlement fund in
exchange for complete release. The Superior Court for Middlesex County, New Jersey has, therefore, dismissed all of these cases. In addition, our


insurers
reimbursed us for the costs of the defense. A seventh lawsuit, also brought by a single customer, was tried before a federal judge in New Jersey in February 2000, with a defendant's verdict
entered in favor of Iron Mountain. An eighth lawsuit filed by an injured firefighter was settled by our insurer for a nominal amount. Several other claims that were originally filed in relation to
these lawsuits have been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by the customers, abutting business owners, and/or their insurance carriers.

c.     Pierce,
H-W Associates, Pioneer and Sequedex Proceedings

We
are involved as a plaintiff or defendant in a series of actions in New Jersey and Pennsylvania generally involving or arising out of assertions by Iron Mountain Incorporated that J.
Peter Pierce, Sr. and others engaged in conduct in respect of an entity, Sequedex, LLC ("Sequedex"), that constituted a breach of Mr. Pierce's contractual and fiduciary obligations to us. The
following is a summary of each of those cases.

On
March 28, 2002, Iron Mountain Incorporated and Iron Mountain Information Management, Inc. ("IMIM"), one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, commenced an action in the
Middlesex County, New Jersey, Superior Court, Chancery Division, captioned Iron Mountain Incorporated and Iron Mountain Information Management, Inc. v. J. Peter Pierce, Sr., Douglas B. Huntley,
J. Michael Gold, Fred A. Mathewson, Jr., Michael DiIanni, J. Anthony Hayden, Pioneer Capital, LLC, and Sequedex, LLC. In the complaint, we alleged that defendant J. Peter Pierce, Sr., a former member
of our Board of Directors and the former President of IMIM until his termination without cause effective June 30, 2000, violated his fiduciary obligations, as well as various noncompetition and
other provisions of an employment agreement with us, dated February 1, 2000, by providing direct and/or indirect financial, management and other support to defendant Sequedex. Sequedex was
established in October 2000, and competed directly with us in the records and information management services industry. The complaint also alleged that Mr. Pierce and certain of the
other defendants, who were employed by or affiliated with Pierce Leahy Corp. prior to the merger of Pierce Leahy with Iron Mountain in February 2000, misappropriated and used our trade secrets
and other confidential information. Finally, the complaint asserted claims against Sequedex and others for tortious interference with contractual relations, against all of the defendants for civil
conspiracy in respect of the matters described above, and against
defendant Michael DiIanni for breach of his employment agreement with IMIM, dated September 6, 2000. The litigation sought injunctions in respect of certain matters and recovery of damages
against the defendants.

On
April 12, 2002, we also initiated a related arbitration proceeding against Mr. Pierce before the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, office of the American Arbitration
Association (the "AAA") pursuant to an arbitration clause in the employment agreement between us and Mr. Pierce. In the arbitration, Mr. Pierce counterclaimed for indemnification of his
expenses, including attorneys' fees. We disputed Mr. Pierce's claim. On July 19, 2002, the litigation was stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding. On February 25,
2003, in response to our request, the AAA removed the arbitrator. The arbitration proceeding was transferred by agreement of the parties to ADR Options, Inc. On February 4, 2004, the
arbitrator rendered a decision. The arbitrator did not find the evidence provided by us in our action against Mr. Pierce sufficient to rule in our favor on the particular claims at issue. In


addition,
the arbitrator ruled that, pursuant to an indemnification provision in Mr. Pierce's employment agreement, we must pay Mr. Pierce's attorneys fees and costs that are
attributable to this single arbitration. The arbitrator established a procedure to ascertain the amount of these fees and expenses. We filed a motion to vacate the arbitrator's decision and award in
Middlesex County, New Jersey. On June 16, 2004, that court denied our motion to vacate and confirmed the arbitration decision. We appealed the court's decision to the Appellate Division of the
New Jersey Superior Court and voluntarily withdrew, without prejudice, the claims in that case other than those purportedly covered by the arbitration decision. Mr. Pierce filed a motion to
dismiss the appeal, which was denied by the Appellate Division. Mr. Pierce subsequently filed an opposition to the appeal. The parties are awaiting notice of a hearing date for the appeal.

On
September 13, 2004, the arbitrator issued a final award, granting Mr. Pierce indemnification for legal expenses incurred in the arbitration in the amount of
approximately $1,600. Mr. Pierce brought an action in the Superior Court for Middlesex County to confirm such award and such court issued an order to show cause. We opposed this action and
filed a motion to dismiss Mr. Pierce's claims and vacate the arbitration award, or in the alternative, for a stay pending disposition of the pending appeal regarding the motion to vacate.

On
December 16, 2002, Hartford Windsor Associates, L.P. ("H-W Associates"), Hartford General, LLC, J. Anthony Hayden, Mr. Pierce, Frank Seidman and John H.
Greenwald, Jr. commenced an action in the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, against Iron Mountain Incorporated. In the complaint, the plaintiffs allege that H-W
Associates purchased a warehouse property in Connecticut to serve as a records storage facility, and entered into a lease for the facility with Sequedex, then a competitor of ours, and that the
remaining plaintiffs were limited or general partners of H-W Associates. The plaintiffs also allege that we tortiously interfered with Sequedex's contractual relations with an actual or
prospective customer of Sequedex and, as a result, caused Sequedex to default on its lease to H-W Associates. The complaint seeks damages in excess of $100,000.. We have denied the
material allegations in the complaint filed against us by H-W Associates and the other plaintiffs and have since
filed counterclaims against the plaintiffs alleging tortious interference with our business relationship with one of our longstanding customers. Certain discovery has been undertaken.

Also
on December 16, 2002, Pioneer Capital L.P. ("Pioneer"), Pioneer Capital Genpar, Inc. ("PCG"), the general partner of Pioneer, and Mr. Pierce, the President of
PCG, commenced an action in the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, against Iron Mountain Incorporated, C. Richard Reese, John F. Kenny, Jr., Garry Watzke, Schooner Capital LLC
("Schooner") and Vincent J. Ryan. The named individuals are Directors and/or officers of Iron Mountain Incorporated and Schooner is a shareholder of Iron Mountain Incorporated. In the complaint, the
plaintiffs allege that the defendants had numerous conversations and arrangements with Thomas Carr, one of Mr. Pierce's and Pioneer's business partners in a company named Logisteq LLC. The
plaintiffs further allege that, as a result of such conversations and arrangements, defendants conspired to, and did intentionally, interfere with Pioneer's relationship with its partner and Logisteq.
The plaintiffs also allege that defendants damaged Mr. Pierce's reputation in the community by telling our employees and other third parties that Mr. Pierce breached his employment
agreement with us,


misappropriated
and used our confidential information, breached his fiduciary duties to our shareholders and assisted Sequedex, then a competitor of ours, in unfairly competing with us. Finally, the
complaint alleges that the business partner in Logisteq taped conversations with Mr. Pierce and others which allegedly violated privacy laws, that the defendants knew, or should have known,
that the tapes were being made without the consent of the individuals and, as a result, Mr. Pierce was harmed. The complaint seeks damages in excess of $5,000,000. We and the other defendants
have challenged the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs' pleadings in each of these cases and the court has issued a notice of its intention to dismiss the case for inactivity unless a party gives
written notice of his or its intention to proceed by April 15, 2005.

On
September 10, 2003, IMIM filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania in a matter related to the litigation between Iron Mountain
Incorporated and Sequedex, Mr. Pierce and others disclosed above. The new matter named Sequedex, J. Michael Gold and Peter Hamilton as defendants, and alleges that in 2000 defendants Gold and
Hamilton, both former IMIM employees, used confidential and proprietary business information that they had obtained while employed by IMIM to form their own records management company, Sequedex. The
complaint also alleged unlawful interference with IMIM's contractual relationship with a certain customer and other matters. The defendants filed preliminary objections to our complaint and we
answered those preliminary objections. This matter has been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.

In
approximately October 2000, three former management employees of IMIM became employed by or otherwise associated with Sequedex. IMIM commenced actions against these three
former employees to enforce its rights under their confidentiality and non-competition agreements. IMIM also asserted claims against Sequedex for tortious interference with these
agreements, and against both Sequedex and the former employees for misappropriation and use of IMIM's trade secrets and confidential information.

The
defendants in all three cases denied the material allegations in IMIM's complaints and asserted various affirmative defenses. Sequedex and the individual defendants filed
counterclaims against IMIM and third party complaints against Iron Mountain Incorporated. The counterclaims and third party complaints asserted claims for tortious interference with certain contracts
and prospective business relations between Sequedex and its current and potential customers as well as a claim for trade disparagement and defamation, and sought approximately $58,000 in damages, plus
unspecified punitive damages. A trial of the three actions in which the Sequedex counterclaims and third party complaints were asserted occurred in April and May of 2004. On June 18, 2004, the
Court held that the three individual defendants had not violated their covenants not to compete and had not misappropriated any of IMIM's trade secrets or confidential information, that Sequedex had
not tortiously interfered with those agreements, and that IMIM and Iron Mountain Incorporated had not interfered with any of Sequedex's potential or actual business relationships and had not
disparaged or defamed Sequedex. The Court thus entered a judgment dismissing all claims and counterclaims. Sequedex appealed the Court's decision to the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior
Court. Iron Mountain Incorporated and IMIM filed an appellate brief in opposition to Sequedex's appeal. We intend to oppose the appeal by Sequedex vigorously. The parties are awaiting notice of a
hearing date for the appeal.


d.     Other
Litigation

In
addition to the matters discussed above, we are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business with a portion of the defense and/or settlement costs being
covered by various commercial liability insurance policies purchased by us. In the opinion of management, no other material legal proceedings are pending to which we, or any of our properties, are
subject.

The
outcome of Pierce, H-W Associates, Pioneer and Sequedex proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Based on our present assessment of the situation, after
consultation with legal counsel, management does not believe that the outcome of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, although
there can be no assurance in this regard. In addition, we record legal costs associated with loss contingencies as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.

14. Related Party Transactions

We lease space to an affiliated company, Schooner, for its corporate headquarters located in Boston, Massachusetts. For the years ended December 31, 2002,
2003 and 2004, Schooner paid rent to us totaling $128, $144 and $153, respectively. We lease facilities from an officer and three separate limited
partnerships, whose general partner was a related party. Our aggregate rental payment for such facilities during 2002, 2003 and 2004 was $1,372, $1,309 and $1,345, respectively.

We
have an agreement with Leo W. Pierce, Sr., our former Chairman Emeritus and the father of J. Peter Pierce, our former director, that requires pension payments of $8 per month
until his death. The total benefit is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in the amount of $826 as of December 31, 2004.

At
December 31, 2004, we have outstanding loans to an officer with an aggregate principal amount of $87. These notes bear interest at a variable rate. This liability was assumed
in connection with our merger with Pierce Leahy.

15. Employee Benefit Plans

a.     Iron
Mountain Companies 401(k) Plan

We
have a defined contribution plan, which generally covers all non-union U.S. employees meeting certain service requirements. Eligible employees may elect to defer from 1%
to 25% of compensation per pay period up to the amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, IME operates a defined contribution plan, which is similar to the U.S.'s 401(k) Plan. We make
matching contributions based on the amount of an employee's contribution in accordance with the plan document. We have expensed $3,043, $4,164 and $4,320 for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2003 and 2004, respectively.


b.     Employee
Stock Purchase Plan

On
March 23, 1998, we introduced an employee stock purchase plan (the "Plan"), participation in which is available to substantially all employees who meet certain service
eligibility requirements. The Plan was approved by our shareholders on May 28, 1998 and commenced operations on October 1, 1998. The
Plan provided a way for our eligible employees to become shareholders on favorable terms. The Plan provided for the purchase of up to 843,750 shares of our common stock by eligible employees through
successive offering periods. At the start of each offering period, participating employees were granted options to acquire our common stock. As there were no shares remaining in the Plan on
December 31, 2002, a new employee stock purchase plan (the "2003 Plan"), which provides for the purchase of up to 1,125,000 shares of our common stock was approved by our shareholders in
May 2003 and commenced operations on July 1, 2003. During each offering period, participating employees accumulate after-tax payroll contributions, up to a maximum of 15% of
their compensation, to pay the exercise price of their options. At the end of the offering period, outstanding options are exercised, and each employee's accumulated contributions are used to purchase
our common stock. The price for shares purchased under the Plan was, and under the 2003 Plan is, 85% of their market price at either the beginning or the end of the offering period, whichever was or
is lower. There were 240,179, 133,072 and 348,320 shares purchased under the Plan and the 2003 Plan for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. The number of shares
available for purchase at December 31, 2004 was 643,608.


REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To
the Board of Directors of

Iron Mountain Europe Limited:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Iron Mountain Europe Limited as of October 31, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and comprehensive (loss)/income and cash flows for the two years ended October 31, 2003. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the management of
Iron Mountain Europe Limited. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Iron Mountain Europe Limited at
October 31, 2003 and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the two years ended October 31, 2003, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America.
