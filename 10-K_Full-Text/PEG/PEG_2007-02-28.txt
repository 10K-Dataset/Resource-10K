PART I

This combined Annual Report on Form 10-K is separately filed by PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings. Information contained herein relating to any individual company is filed by such
  company on its own behalf. PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings each makes representations only as to itself and its subsidiaries and makes no other representations whatsoever as to any other company.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

PSEG was incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey in 1985 and has its principal executive offices located at 80 Park Plaza, Newark, New Jersey 07102. PSEG has four principal direct
  wholly owned subsidiaries: PSE&G, Power, Energy Holdings and PSEG Services Corporation (Services). The following organization chart shows PSEG and its principal subsidiaries, as well as the principal
  operating subsidiaries of Power: PSEG Fossil LLC (Fossil), PSEG Nuclear LLC (Nuclear) and PSEG Energy Resources & Trade LLC (ER&T); and of Energy Holdings: PSEG Global L.L.C. (Global) and
  PSEG Resources L.L.C. (Resources):

PSEG is an energy company with a diversified business mix. PSEG’s operations are primarily in the Northeastern and Mid Atlantic United States (U.S.) and in other select markets. As the competitive
  portion of PSEG’s business has grown, the resulting financial risks and rewards have become greater, causing financial requirements to change and increasing the volatility of earnings and cash flows.

For additional information, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A)—Overview of 2006 and Future Outlook.


Termination of Merger Agreement

On December 20, 2004, PSEG entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with Exelon Corporation (Exelon) providing for a merger of PSEG with and into Exelon (Merger).
  On September 14, 2006, PSEG received from Exelon a formal notice terminating the Merger under the provisions of the Merger Agreement.

PSE&G

PSE&G is a New Jersey corporation, incorporated in 1924, and has its principal executive offices at 80 Park Plaza, Newark, New Jersey 07102. PSE&G is an operating public utility company engaged
  principally in the transmission and distribution of electric energy and gas in New Jersey. In addition, PSE&G owns PSE&G Transition Funding LLC (Transition Funding) and PSE&G Transition Funding II LLC
  (Transition Funding II), which are bankruptcy-remote entities that purchased the irrevocable right to receive certain non-bypassable charges per Kilowatt-hour (kWh) of energy delivered to PSE&G
  customers and issued transition bonds secured by such property.

PSE&G provides electric and gas service in areas of New Jersey in which approximately 5.5 million people, about 70% of the state’s population, reside. PSE&G’s electric and gas service area is a corridor
  of approximately 2,600 square miles running diagonally across New Jersey from Bergen County in the northeast to an area below the city of Camden in the southwest. The greater portion of this area is
  served with both electricity and gas, but some parts are served with electricity only and other parts with gas only. This heavily populated, commercialized and industrialized territory encompasses most of
  New Jersey’s largest municipalities, including its six largest cities—Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, Elizabeth, Trenton and Camden—in addition to approximately 300 suburban and rural communities. This
  service territory contains a diversified mix of commerce and industry, including major facilities of many nationally prominent corporations. PSE&G’s load requirements are split among residential, commercial
  and industrial customers, described below under customers. PSE&G believes that it has all the non-exclusive franchise rights (including consents) necessary for its electric and gas distribution operations in the
  territory it serves.

Energy Supply

PSE&G distributes electric energy and gas to end-use customers within its designated service territory. All electric and gas customers in New Jersey have the ability to choose an electric energy and/or
  gas supplier. Pursuant to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) requirements, PSE&G serves as the supplier of last resort for electric and gas customers within its service territory. PSE&G earns no
  margin on the commodity portion of its electric and gas sales.

As shown in the table below, PSE&G continues to provide the electric energy and gas supply for the majority of the customers in its service territory for the year ended December 31, 2006.

New Jersey’s Electric Distribution Companies (EDCs), including PSE&G, provide two types of Basic Generation Service (BGS). BGS-Fixed Price (FP) provides supply for smaller commercial and
  residential customers at seasonally-adjusted fixed prices and BGS-Commercial and Industrial Energy Price (CIEP) provides supply for larger customers at hourly PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM) real-
  time market prices. BGS prices are determined through annual auctions conducted before the BPU.

PSE&G has a full requirements contract with Power to meet the Basic Gas Supply Service (BGSS) requirements of PSE&G’s gas customers. The contract term extends to March 31, 2012, and year-to-year
  thereafter. Power charges PSE&G for gas commodity costs which PSE&G recovers from its customers.

Any difference between the BGS and BGSS costs and revenues received from PSE&G’s residential customers are deferred and collected or refunded through adjustments in future rates.


Distribution Rates

PSE&G earns margins through the transmission and distribution of electricity and gas. PSE&G’s revenues for these services are based upon tariffs approved by the BPU and FERC. Approximately 98% of
  PSE&G’s 2006 revenues were covered by BPU tariffs. The demand for electric energy and gas by PSE&G’s customers is affected by customer conservation, economic conditions, weather and other factors not
  within PSE&G’s control.

On November 9, 2006 the BPU approved separate settlements providing for increases in PSE&G’s electric and gas base rates. The settlements include a restriction against any further base rate changes
  becoming effective before November 15, 2009. In addition, PSE&G must file a joint electric and gas petition for any future base rate increases. For additional information on these settlements, see Regulatory
  Issues—State Regulation.

Market Price Environment

Over the past few years, there has been a significant volatility in commodity prices, including fuel, emission allowances and electricity. Such volatility can have a considerable impact on PSE&G since a
  rising commodity price environment results in higher delivered electric and gas rates for end-use customers, and may result in decreased demand by end users of both electricity and gas, increased regulatory
  pressures and greater working capital requirements as the collection of higher commodity costs may be deferred under PSEG’s regulated rate structure. For additional information see Item 7. MD&A.

Competitive Environment

The electric and gas transmission and distribution business has minimal risks from competitors. PSE&G’s transmission and distribution business is minimally impacted when customers choose alternate
  electric or gas suppliers since PSE&G earns its return by providing transmission and distribution service, not by supplying the commodity.

Customers

As of December 31, 2006, PSE&G provided service to approximately 2.1 million electric customers and approximately 1.7 million gas customers, detailed below. In addition to its transmission and
  distribution business, PSE&G also offers appliance services and repairs to customers throughout its service territory.

Employee Relations

As of December 31, 2006, PSE&G had 6,154 employees. PSE&G has six-year collective bargaining agreements, which were ratified in 2005, with four unions representing 4,955 employees. PSE&G believes
  that it maintains satisfactory relationships with its employees.

Power

Power is a Delaware limited liability company, formed in 1999, and has its principal executive offices at 80 Park Plaza, Newark, New Jersey 07102. Power is a multi-regional, wholesale energy supply
  company that integrates its generating asset operations with its wholesale energy, fuel supply, energy trading and marketing and risk management functions through three principal direct wholly owned
  subsidiaries: Nuclear, Fossil and ER&T.

As of December 31, 2006, Power’s generation portfolio consisted of approximately 14,639 MW of installed capacity, which is primarily located in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic regions of the U.S.
  where


some of the nation’s largest and most developed energy markets are located. For additional information, see Item 2. Properties.

As a merchant generator, Power’s profit is derived from selling under contract or on the spot market a range of diverse products such as energy, capacity, emissions credits, congestion credits and a
  series of energy-related products used to optimize the operation of the energy grid, known as ancillary services. Power’s revenues also include gas supply sales under the BGSS contract with PSE&G.

Nuclear

Nuclear has an ownership interest in five nuclear generating units: the Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1 and 2 (Salem 1 and 2), each owned 57.41% by Nuclear and 42.59% by Exelon
  Generation; the Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station (Hope Creek), which is owned 100% by Nuclear; and, the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station Units 2 and 3 (Peach Bottom 2 and 3), each of
  which is operated by Exelon Generation and owned 50% by Nuclear and 50% by Exelon Generation. For additional information, see Item 2. Properties—Power.

Nuclear Operations

In January 2005, Nuclear entered into an Operating Service Contract (OSC) with Exelon Generation relating to the operation of the Hope Creek and Salem nuclear generating stations. The OSC
  requires Exelon Generation to provide key personnel to oversee daily plant operations at the Hope Creek and Salem nuclear generating stations and to implement a management model that Exelon has
  used to manage its own nuclear facilities. Nuclear continues as the license holder with exclusive legal authority to operate and maintain the Salem and Hope Creek plants, retains responsibility for
  management oversight and has full authority with respect to the marketing of its share of the output from the facilities. In October 2006, Nuclear informed Exelon Generation that it was electing to continue
  the OSC for up to two years beyond the initial January 2007 period.

In December 2006, Power announced its plans to resume direct management of the Salem and Hope Creek nuclear generating stations before the expiration of the OSC. As part of this plan, on January
  1, 2007, the senior management team at Salem and Hope Creek, which consisted of three senior executives from Exelon Generation, became employees of Power.

During 2006, over half of Power’s generating output was from its nuclear generating stations. Nuclear unit capacity factors for 2006 were as follows:

For additional information on recent operational issues, see Regulatory Issues—Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

Nuclear Fuel

Nuclear has several long-term purchase contracts for the supply of nuclear fuel for the Salem and Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Stations which include:

•

purchase of uranium (concentrates and uranium hexafluoride);

•

conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride;

•

enrichment of uranium hexafluoride; and

•

fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies.


The nuclear fuel markets are competitive and although prices for uranium, conversion and enrichment are increasing, Nuclear does not anticipate any significant problems in meeting its future
  requirements.

Nuclear has been advised by Exelon Generation that it has similar purchase contracts to satisfy the fuel requirements for Peach Bottom. For additional information, see Item 7. MD&A—Overview of 2006
  and Future Outlook—Power and Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes.

Fossil

Fossil has an ownership interest in 17 generating stations, primarily in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic U.S., including the Bethlehem Energy Center in New York and the Linden station in New Jersey,
  which were completed and placed in service in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Power’s facility in Indiana, the Lawrenceburg Energy Center, is currently under an agreement to be sold. For additional
  information, see Item 2. Properties—Power.

Fossil uses coal, natural gas and oil for electric generation. These fuels are purchased through various contracts and in the spot market and represent a significant portion of Power’s working capital
  requirements. In order to minimize emissions levels, the Bridgeport generating facility uses a specific type of coal, which is obtained from Indonesia through a fixed-price supply contract that runs through
  2008. If the supply of coal from Indonesia or equivalent coal from other sources was not available for the Connecticut facilities, additional material capital expenditures could be required to modify the
  existing plants to enable their continued operation. In addition, the Hudson facility, under a consent decree with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) and the U.S.
  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), will also utilize this type of coal. Power believes it has access to sufficient fuel supply, including transportation, for its facilities over the next several years. For
  additional information, see Item 7. MD&A—Overview of 2006 and Future Outlook—Power and Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes.

ER&T

ER&T purchases the capacity and energy produced by each of the generation subsidiaries of Power. In conjunction with these purchases, ER&T uses commodity and financial instruments designed to cover
  estimated commitments for BGS and other bilateral contract agreements. ER&T also markets electricity, capacity, ancillary services and natural gas products on a wholesale basis. ER&T is a fully integrated
  wholesale energy marketing and trading organization that is active in the long-term and spot wholesale energy and energy-related markets.

Electric Supply

Power’s generation capacity is comprised of a diverse mix of fuels of approximately 47% gas, 26% nuclear, 18% coal, 8% oil and 1% pumped storage. Power’s fuel diversity serves to mitigate risks
  associated with fuel price volatility and market demand cycles.

The following table indicates proportionate MWh output of Power’s generating stations by fuel type, based on actual 2006 output of approximately 54,000 MWhs, and its estimated 53,000 MWh output
  by fuel type for 2007.

For a discussion of Power’s management and hedging strategy relating to its energy sales supply and fuel needs, see Market Price Environment and Item 7A. MD&A—Overview of 2006 and Future
  Outlook—Power.

Gas Supply

As described above, Power sells gas to PSE&G under the BGSS contract. Additionally, based upon availability, Power sells gas to others. About 41% of PSE&G’s peak daily gas requirements are provided
  through firm transportation, which is available every day of the year. The remainder comes from field storage, liquefied natural gas, seasonal purchases, contract peaking supply, propane and refinery and
  landfill gas. Power purchases gas for its gas operations directly from natural gas producers and marketers. These supplies are transported to New Jersey by four interstate pipeline suppliers.

Power has approximately 1 billion cubic-feet-per-day of firm transportation capacity under contract to meet the primary needs of PSE&G’s gas consumers and the needs of its own generation fleet. In
  addition, Power supplements that supply with a total storage capacity of 78 billion cubic feet that provides a maximum of approximately 1 billion cubic feet-per-day of gas during the winter season.

Power expects to be able to meet the energy-related demands of its firm natural gas customers. However, the ability to maintain an adequate supply could be affected by several factors not within
  Power’s control, including curtailments of natural gas by its suppliers, severe weather and the availability of feedstocks for the production of supplements to its natural gas supply. In addition, supply of all
  types of gas is affected by the nationwide availability of all sources of fuel for energy production.

Market Price Environment

System operators in the electric markets in which Power participates will generally dispatch the lowest cost units in the system first, with higher cost units dispatched as demand increases. As such,
  nuclear units, with their low variable cost of operation, will generally be dispatched whenever they are available. Coal units generally follow next in the merit order of dispatch and gas and oil units generally
  follow to meet the total amount of demand. The price that all dispatched units receive is set by the last, or marginal unit that is dispatched.

This method of determining supply and pricing creates an environment where natural gas prices often have a major impact on the price that generators will receive for their output, especially in periods
  of relatively strong demand. As such, significant changes in the price of natural gas will often translate into significant changes in the price of electricity.

As a merchant generator, Power’s profit is derived from selling under contract or on the spot market a range of diverse products such as energy, capacity, emissions credits, congestion credits and a
  series of energy-related products that the system operator uses to optimize the operation of the energy grid, known as ancillary services. Accordingly, commodity prices, such as electricity, gas, coal and
  emissions, as well as the availability of Power’s diverse fleet of generation units to produce these products, when necessary, have a considerable effect on Power’s profitability. There is significant volatility in
  commodity markets, including electricity, fuel and emission allowances. For example, the spot price of electricity at the quoted PJM West market has increased from an average of about $25 per MWh for
  2002 to an average of about $60 per MWh in 2005 and then decreased to an average of about $50 per MWh in 2006. Similarly, the price of natural gas at the Henry Hub terminal has increased from an average of about $3 per one million British Thermal Units (MMBtu)
  in 2002 to about $9 per MMBtu in 2005 and then decreased to an average of about $7 per MMBtu in 2006. The prices at which transactions are entered into for future delivery of these products, as evidenced through the market for forward contracts at points such as PJM
  West, have escalated as well. The historical spot prices and forward prices as of year-end 2006 are reflected in the graphs below.


In the electricity markets where Power participates, the pricing of electricity can vary by location. For example, prices may be higher in congested areas due to transmission constraints during peak
  demand periods reflecting the bid prices of the higher cost units that are dispatched to supply demand. This typically occurs in the eastern portion of PJM, where many of Power’s plants are located. At
  various times, depending upon its production and its obligations, these price differentials can serve to increase or decrease Power’s profitability.

While the prices reflected in the tables above do not necessarily represent prices at which Power has contracted, they are representative of market prices at relatively liquid hubs, with nearer term
  forward pricing generally resulting from more liquid markets than pricing for later years. While they provide some perspective on past and future prices and recent prices are considerably higher than in
  prior years, the forward prices are highly volatile, and there is no assurance that such prices will remain in effect nor that Power will be able to contract its output at these forward prices.

Power is also provided with payments from the various markets for the capability to provide electricity, known as a capacity payments, which are reflective of the value to the grid for having the
  assurance of sufficient generating capacity to meet system reliability and energy requirements, and to encourage the future investment in adequate sources of new generation to meet system demand. While
  there is generally sufficient capacity in the markets in which Power operates, there are certain areas in these markets where there are constraints in the transmission system, causing concerns for reliability
  and a more acute need for capacity. Some generators, including Power, announced the retirement of certain older generating facilities in these constrained areas due to insufficient revenues to support their
  continued operation. In separate instances, both PJM and the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) responded with Reliability-Must-Run (RMR) contracts for these units to enable their continued
  availability that provide their owners with fixed payments which, while not necessarily reflective of the full value of those units’ contribution to reliability (e.g. they are


cost-based), are nonetheless significant. Such payment structure by its nature acknowledges that these units provide a reliability service that is not compensated in the existing markets. It also suggests that
  fixed periodic payments, as would be provided in a capacity market, are an appropriate form of compensation for such units for this service. Power receives RMR payments in both PJM and NEPOOL.

In addition, FERC issued certain orders in 2006 related to market design that have changed the nature of capacity payments in the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) and is scheduled to change the
  nature of payments in PJM. In PJM, a new capacity-pricing regime known as the Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) will provide generators with differentiated capacity payments based upon the location of
  their respective facilities. Similarly, the Forward Capacity Market (FCM) settlement in NEPOOL provides for locational capacity payments. Both market designs are based in part on the premise that a
  more structured, forward-looking, transparent pricing scheme will give prospective investors in new generating facilities more clarity on the future value of capacity, sending a pricing signal to encourage
  expansion of capacity for future market demands. FERC has approved the market changes in each of these markets, with the anticipated start date for RPM set for June 1, 2007 and FCM transition period
  having begun on December 1, 2006. Power believes that the majority of its generating capacity may experience changes in value from aspects of these market designs. While Power believes it may derive
  considerable additional revenue from these changes, it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these changes.

For additional information on Power’s collection of RMR payments in PJM and NEPOOL and the RPM and FCM proposals, see Regulatory Issues—Federal Regulation.

Competitive Environment

Power’s competitors include merchant generators with or without trading capabilities, including banks, funds and other financial entities, utilities that have generating capability or have formed
  generation and/or trading affiliates, aggregators, wholesale power marketers and developers of transmission and Demand Side Management (DSM) projects and combinations thereof. These participants
  compete with Power and one another buying and selling in wholesale power pools, entering into bilateral contracts and/or selling to aggregated retail customers.

Power’s businesses are also under competitive pressure due to technological advances in the power industry and increased efficiency in certain energy markets. For example, it is possible that advances
  in technology, such as distributed generation, will reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing electricity to a level that is competitive with that of most central station electric production.

There is also a risk to Power if states should decide to turn away from competition and allow regulated utilities to continue to own or reacquire and operate generating stations in a regulated and
  potentially uneconomical manner, or to encourage rate-based generation for the construction of new base-load units. This has already occurred in certain states. The lack of consistent rules in energy
  markets can negatively impact the competitiveness of Power’s plants. Also, regional inconsistencies in environmental regulations, particularly those related to emissions, have put some of Power’s plants
  which are located in the Northeast, where rules are more stringent, at an economic disadvantage compared to its competitors in certain Midwest states.

Also, environmental issues such as air pollution controls may have a competitive impact on Power to the extent its plants are more expensive to maintain in compliance, thus affecting its ability to be a
  lower cost provider compared to competitors without such restrictions.

In addition, as discussed in the Regulatory Issues section herein–specifically, in the discussion concerning (i) Transmission Rates and Cost Allocation and (ii) Transmission Infrastructure–current rules
  being developed at FERC, at DOE and at PJM with respect to the construction of transmission and the allocation of costs for such construction may have the effect of altering the level playing field
  between transmission options and generation options, which could have a competitive impact upon PSEG and Power.

Customers

As EWGs, Power’s subsidiaries do not directly serve retail customers. Power uses its generation facilities primarily for the production of electricity for sale at the wholesale level. Power’s customers
  consist mainly of wholesale buyers, primarily within PJM, but also in New York and Connecticut. Power is at times a direct or indirect supplier of New Jersey’s EDCs, including PSE&G, depending on the
  positions it takes in the New Jersey BGS auction. In prior years, Power had also been a bidder in the CIEP auction, which serves large


industrial and commercial customers at hourly PJM real-time market prices for a term of 12 months. Power’s three-year contract with a Connecticut utility ended on December 31, 2006. These contracts are
  full requirements contracts, where Power is responsible to serve a percentage of the full supply needs of the customer class being served, including energy, capacity, congestion and ancillary services. In
  addition, Power has four-year contracts with two Pennsylvania utilities expiring in 2008 and is considering pursuing similar opportunities in other states.

PSE&G has a full requirements contract with Power to meet the gas supply requirements of PSE&G’s gas customers. The contract term was originally through March 31, 2007, and year-to-year thereafter.
  In the settlement of the 2005/06 BGSS proceeding the Parties agreed to an amendment to the contract that changed the contract term to March 31, 2012, and year-to-year thereafter. Power charges PSE&G
  for gas commodity costs which PSE&G recovers from its customers. Any difference between the residential gas cost charged by Power under the BGSS contract and revenues received from PSE&G’s
  residential customers are deferred and collected or refunded through adjustments in future rates.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately 46% of Power’s revenue was comprised of billings to PSE&G for BGS and BGSS. See Note 21. Related-Party Transactions of the Notes for
  additional information.

Employee Relations

As of December 31, 2006, Power had 2,538 employees, of which 1,414 employees (705 employees for Fossil and 708 employees for Nuclear) are represented by three union groups under six-year
  collective bargaining agreements, which were ratified in February, July and August 2005, respectively. Power believes that it maintains satisfactory relationships with its employees.

Energy Holdings

Energy Holdings is a New Jersey limited liability company and is the successor to PSEG Energy Holdings Inc., which was incorporated in 1989. Energy Holdings’ principal executive offices are located
  at 80 Park Plaza, Newark, New Jersey 07102. Energy Holdings has two principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries, which are also its segments: Global and Resources.

Energy Holdings pursued investment opportunities in the domestic and international energy markets, with Global focused on the operating segments of the electric industries and Resources primarily
  made financial investments in these industries.

Global

Global owns investments in power producers and distributors that own and operate electric generation and distribution facilities in selected domestic and international markets. See Item 2.
  Properties—Energy Holdings for discussion of individual investments, including significant power purchase agreements (PPAs), fuel supply agreements, financing structures and other matters.

Global’s assets include consolidated projects and those accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2006, Global’s share of project MW and number of customers by region are as

Energy Holdings has reduced its international risk by opportunistically monetizing investments at Global that no longer had a strategic fit. During the past three years,
  Global has received proceeds of over $1 billion from sales of investments in China, Brazil, Poland, India, Africa and the Middle East. The decrease in Global’s portfolio size due to the above sales was
  partially offset by strong earnings from its Texas generation facilities and its electric distribution companies in Chile and Peru. As a result, Global’s current portfolio is primarily comprised of investments in
  Chile, Peru and the United States. Global also has modest sized investments in Italy, India and Venezuela totaling about 8% of Global’s total investment balance.

As a result of these sales, approximately 50% of Global’s future earnings is expected to be derived from its domestic generation business, of which, over half are from its 2,000 MW gas-fired combined cycle
  merchant generation business in Texas, with the balance from its 12 fully-contracted generating facilities in which Global’s ownership interests equate to nearly 400 MW. The other 50% of Global’s earnings
  is expected to  be essentially from three electric distribution businesses in Chile and Peru and a 183 MW hydro generation facility in Peru. The regulatory environments in both Chile and Peru have been generally constructive
  since Global acquired these investments. Rate cases are held every four years (with the next rate case beginning in 2008) and the rate calculation methodologies are designed to achieve a reasonable return
  on the net replacement value of each system. See Regulation for additional information on the regulatory process in Chile and Peru. Chile also maintains an investment grade rating
  and Peru’s rating, although non-investment grade, has improved.

Energy Holdings continues to review Global’s portfolio, with a focus on its international investments. As part of this review, Energy Holdings considers the returns of its remaining investments against
  alternative investments across the PSEG companies, while considering the strategic fit and relative risks of these businesses.

Market Price Environment

Global’s projects in California, Hawaii and New Hampshire are fully contracted under long-term PPAs with the public utilities or power procurers in those areas. Therefore, Global does not have price
  risk with respect to the output of such assets, and generally, with respect to such assets, has limited risk with respect to fuel prices. Global’s risks related to these projects are primarily operational in nature
  and have historically been minimal.

Global’s generation business in Texas (Texas Independent Energy. L. P. (TIE)) is a merchant generation business with higher risks. TIE seeks to enter into a mix of contracts to sell its output—approximately 20% of its output is sold under a five-year contract, which expires in 2010, and another 10% to 20% is sold forward under one-year on-peak calendar or seasonal contracts
  and the balance is sold during the year. As a result, TIE’s business is subject to substantial volatility in earnings and cash flows as power prices fluctuate. Although Global’s business in Texas has performed
  very well as high natural gas prices and the resulting high energy prices led to strong margins in 2005 and 2006, there can be no assurances that such pricing in the market will continue at these levels.

Competitive Environment

Although TIE’s generating stations operate very efficiently relative to other gas-fired generating plants, new technology could make TIE’s plants less economical in the future. Also, several competitors
  have announced plans to build a substantial amount of capacity in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market. Although it is not clear if this capacity will be built or, if so, what the economic
  impact would be, such additions could impact market prices and TIE’s competitiveness. Also, as ERCOT transitions to nodal pricing from zonal pricing the competitiveness of TIE’s generating plants could
  be impacted. As TIE represents a substantial portion of Energy Holdings’ and Global’s business, volatility in that portion of the business will impact Global’s and Energy Holdings’ overall portfolio results.

Of the remaining portion of Global’s business, the majority of its earnings are generated by two major rate-regulated distribution businesses in Chile and one in Peru. Although these entities are not
  granted exclusive franchises, there is minimal competition for distribution companies. See Regulatory Issues—International Regulation for a discussion of the ratemaking process in Chile and Peru. Global
  also owns a


hydro generation facility in Peru. Although new generation capacity is being built in Peru, there are not many opportunities for hydro expansion, mitigating competition with Global’s hydro generation
  investment.

Customers

Global has ownership interests in three distribution companies in South America which serve approximately two million customers. Global also has ownership interests in electric generation facilities
  which sell energy, capacity and ancillary services to numerous customers through PPAs, as well as into the wholesale market. For additional information, see Item 2. Properties—Energy Holdings.

Resources

Resources has investments in energy-related financial transactions and manages a diversified portfolio of assets, including leveraged leases, operating leases, leveraged buyout funds, limited partnerships
  and marketable securities. Established in 1985, Resources has a portfolio of approximately 45 separate investments. Resources does not anticipate making significant additional investments in the near term.

Resources also owns and manages a Demand Side Management (DSM) business. DSM revenues are earned principally from monthly payments received from utilities, which represent shared electricity
  savings from the installation of the energy efficient equipment.

The major components of Resources’ investment portfolio as a percent of its total assets as of December 31, 2006 were:

Leveraged Lease Investments

Resources maintains a portfolio that is designed to provide a fixed rate of return. Income on leveraged leases is recognized by a method which produces a constant rate of return on the outstanding
  investment in the lease, net of the related deferred tax liability, in the years in which the net investment is positive. Any gains or losses incurred as a result of a lease termination are recorded as Operating
  Revenues as these events occur in the ordinary course of business of managing the investment portfolio.

In a leveraged lease, the lessor acquires an asset by investing equity representing approximately 15% to 20% of the cost of the asset and incurring non-recourse lease debt for the balance. The lessor
  acquires economic and tax ownership of the asset and then leases it to the lessee for a period of time no greater than 80% of its remaining useful life. As the owner, the lessor is entitled to depreciate the
  asset under applicable federal and state tax guidelines. In addition, the lessor receives income from lease payments made by the lessee during the term of the lease and from tax benefits associated with
  interest and depreciation deductions with respect to the leased property. The ability of Resources to realize these tax benefits is dependent on operating gains generated by its affiliates and allocated
  pursuant to PSEG’s consolidated tax sharing agreement. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has recently disallowed certain tax deductions claimed by Resources for certain of these leases. See Note 12.
  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes for further discussion. Lease rental payments are unconditional obligations of the lessee and are set at levels at


least sufficient to service the non-recourse lease debt. The lessor is also entitled to any residual value associated with the leased asset at the end of the lease term. An evaluation of the after-tax cash flows to
  the lessor determines the return on the investment. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP), the lease investment is recorded on a net basis and income is recognized as a
  constant return on the net unrecovered investment.

Resources has evaluated the lease investments it has made against specific risk factors. The assumed residual-value risk, if any, is analyzed and verified by third parties at the time an investment is
  made. Credit risk is assessed and, in some cases, mitigated or eliminated through various structuring techniques, such as defeasance mechanisms and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2006, the weighted
  average credit rating of the lessees in the portfolio was A–/A3. Resources has not taken currency risk in its cross-border lease investments. Transactions have been structured with rental payments
  denominated and payable in U.S. dollars. Resources, as a passive lessor or investor, has not taken operating risk with respect to the assets it owns, so leveraged leases have been structured with the lessee
  having an absolute obligation to make rental payments whether or not the related assets operate. The assets subject to lease are an integral element in Resources’ overall security and collateral position. If
  the value of such assets were to be impaired, the rate of return on a particular transaction could be affected. The operating characteristics and the business environment in which the assets operate are,
  therefore, important and must be understood and periodically evaluated. For this reason, Resources will retain, as necessary, experts to conduct appraisals on the assets it owns and leases.

On December 28, 2005, Resources sold its interest in the Seminole Generation Station Unit 2 in Palatka, Florida. For additional information relating to this disposition, see Note 4. Discontinued
  Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments of the Notes.

As of December 31, 2006, Resources has a remaining gross investment in three leased aircraft of approximately $41 million. On September 14, 2005, Delta Airlines (Delta) and Northwest Airlines
  (Northwest), the lessees for Resources’ four remaining aircraft at that time, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This had no material effect on Energy Holdings as it continues to believe that it will
  be able to recover the recorded amount of its investments in these aircraft as of December 31, 2006, although no assurances can be given. In 2004 and 2005, Resources successfully restructured the leases and
  converted the Delta and Northwest leases from leveraged leases to operating leases. The Delta aircraft was sold in January 2006 generating a small gain for Resources.

Other Subsidiaries

Enterprise Group Development Corporation (EGDC), a commercial real estate property management business, is conducting a controlled exit from its real estate business. Total assets of EGDC as of
  December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $70 million and $71 million, respectively, less non-recourse debt of $19 million and $21 million, respectively less minority interest of $6 million for each year, for a net
  investment of approximately $45 million and $44 million, respectively. These investments are composed of three properties in New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia and an 80% partnership interest in
  buildings and land in New Jersey.

Employee Relations

As of December 31, 2006, Energy Holdings had 53 direct employees. In addition, Energy Holdings’ subsidiaries had a total of 1,091 employees, of which 692 were represented by unions under collective
  bargaining agreements expiring between June 2007 and January 2010. Energy Holdings believes that it maintains satisfactory relationships with its employees.

Services

Services is a New Jersey corporation with its principal executive offices at 80 Park Plaza, Newark, New Jersey 07102. Services provides management and administrative and general services to PSEG
  and its subsidiaries. These include accounting, treasury, financial risk management, law, tax, communications, planning, development, human resources, corporate secretarial, information technology,
  investor relations, stockholder services, real estate, insurance, library, records and information services, security and certain other services. Services charges PSEG and its subsidiaries for the cost of work
  performed and services provided pursuant to the terms and conditions of intercompany service agreements. As of December 31, 2006, Services had 932 employees, including 100 employees represented by a
  union group under a six-year collective bargaining agreement that was ratified in February 2005. Services believes that it maintains satisfactory relationships with its employees.

REGULATORY ISSUES

Federal Regulation

Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA)

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

The Energy Policy Act (EP Act), which became law on August 8, 2005, repealed PUHCA as of February 8, 2006 and established PUHCA 2005, which grants to FERC “books and records” oversight of
  public utility holding companies. PSEG had historically claimed an exemption from regulation by the SEC as a registered holding company under PUHCA. As part of that exemption, Fossil, Nuclear,
  certain subsidiaries of Fossil and certain subsidiaries of Energy Holdings with domestic operations obtained EWG or Qualifying Facility (QF) status (the latter designation obtained under the Public Utility
  Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA)), while most of Energy Holdings’ foreign investments obtained Foreign Utility Company (FUCO) status. Notwithstanding the repeal of PUHCA, these companies
  have retained their designations as EWGs, FUCOs or QFs, since such designation affords certain protections under FERC’s PUHCA 2005. Specifically, companies subject to the provisions of PUHCA 2005
  must provide state regulators access to their books and records. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings do not expect PUHCA 2005 to materially affect their respective businesses, prospects or
  properties, and in October 2006, PSEG obtained from FERC a waiver of


PUHCA 2005’s accounting, record retention and reporting requirements. For additional information on the impact of PUHCA repeal, see State Regulation.

Environmental

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

PSEG and its subsidiaries are subject to the rules and regulations relating to environmental issues promulgated by the EPA, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and other regulators. For
  information on environmental regulation, see Environmental Matters.

FERC

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

FERC is an independent federal agency that regulates the transmission of electric energy and sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce pursuant to the Federal Power Act (FPA).
  FERC also regulates the interstate transportation of, as well as certain wholesale sales of, natural gas pursuant to the Natural Gas Act. FERC’s oversight includes: merger review, compliance, including
  Standards of Conduct issues, transmission rates and terms and conditions of service, and market power, market design and capacity design and rates. Several PSEG subsidiaries, including PSE&G, Fossil,
  Nuclear, and ER&T, as well as certain subsidiaries of Fossil and certain domestic subsidiaries of Energy Holdings are “public utilities” as defined by the FPA and subject to extensive regulation by FERC.
  FERC’s regulation of public utilities is comprehensive and governs such matters as rates, services, mergers, financings, affiliate transactions, market conduct and reporting. FERC is also responsible under
  PURPA for administering PURPA’s requirements for QFs. PSEG, through its subsidiaries, owns several QF plants. QFs are subject to many, but not all, of the same FERC requirements as public utilities.

Expanded Merger Review Authority

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

The EP Act expanded FERC’s authority to review mergers and acquisitions under the FPA. It extended the scope of FERC’s authority to require prior FERC approval regarding transactions involving
  certain transfers of generation facilities, certain holding company transactions, and utility mergers and consolidations having a value in excess of $10 million. The EP Act requires that FERC, when
  reviewing proposed transactions, examine cross-subsidization and pledges or encumbrances of utility assets. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are unable to predict the effect of this authority on
  any potential future transactions in which they may be involved.

Compliance

Reliability Standards

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

The EP Act required FERC to empower a single, national Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) to develop and enforce national and regional reliability standards for the U.S. bulk power system.
  FERC has designated the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as this ERO. NERC has filed with FERC delegation agreements that would in turn delegate, to a significant degree, the
  enforcement of such reliability standards to eight regional reliability councils approved by NERC, such as ReliabilityFirst. Thus, the relationship between NERC and the regional reliability councils
  (responsible for reliability standards compliance within a particular geographic region) is a contractual one. PSE&G’s transmission assets, and most of Power’s generation assets, are located within the
  geographic scope of Reliability First, and PSEG’s remaining domestic assets, including the New York, Connecticut and Texas generating assets, are within the scope of other regional reliability councils such
  as NPCC and ERCOT.

After being designated as an ERO, NERC asked FERC to approve a set of proposed mandatory Reliability Standards, many of which mirrored existing, voluntary standards. On October 20, 2006,
  FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR), which proposed to approve 83 of the 107 filed standards and asked for additional information regarding the remaining 24 standards. Compliance
  with these 83


standards, enforcement of which will largely be delegated to the regional reliability councils such as Reliability First, is mandatory and sanctions may attach for non-compliance. Pursuant to the EP Act,
  FERC has the ability to impose penalties of up to $1 million a day for violations of these standards. Under the NOPR, which is not yet a Final Rule, compliance with these Standards will be required by the
  commencement of the 2007 summer peak season. These Standards are applicable to transmission owners and generation owners, and thus PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings (or their subsidiaries)
  will be obligated to comply with the Standards. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are currently evaluating all of the requirements imposed by the Standards and are preparing to ensure that they
  will be in compliance by FERC-required date. It should be noted in this regard that PSE&G’s local control center (LCC) was the first control center voluntarily audited by NERC in January 2006 with respect
  to LCC “readiness.” NERC concluded in this audit that PSE&G has adequate facilities, processes, plans, procedures, tools, and trained personnel to effectively operate as an LLC within PJM and found no
  significant operational problems.

FERC Standards of Conduct

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

On January 18, 2007, FERC issued a NOPR which proposes to make certain changes to its Standards of Conduct applicable to both electric and natural gas transmission providers. The NOPR was
  issued in response to a decision by the United States Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, which vacated FERC’s existing Standards of Conduct as they applied to natural gas pipelines. The NOPR,
  however, proposes changes to the Standards of Conduct for both natural gas and electric providers Some of the proposed changes include modifying the definition of Energy Affiliate and thereby changing
  the scope of applicability of the Standards of Conduct, changing the regulations with respect to the permissible tasks of “shared” employees (employees that may be shared by both the Transmission
  Provider and the Energy Affiliates) and modifying the information disclosure regulations. PSE&G is currently subject to FERC’s Standards of Conduct as a Transmission Provider and subsidiaries of Power
  and Energy Holdings are subject to the Standards of Conduct as Energy Affiliates. Thus, FERC’s proposed changes may have an impact on PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings and the interactions
  between these entities, although its impact is not clear at this time. PSEG is currently evaluating the NOPR and will file comments to the same prior to FERC issuing a Final Rule. The outcome of this
  proceeding cannot be predicted at this time.

Transmission Rates and Cost Allocation

PSEG, PSE&G and Power

PJM Schedule 12 Cost Allocation for Regional Transmission Expansion Planning( RTEP) Projects

On January 5, 2006, PJM proposed cost allocation recommendations for new transmission projects pursuant to Schedule 6 of its FERC-approved Operating Agreement and Schedule 12 of its Open
  Access Transmission Tariff (Tariff). PJM identified the “Responsible Customers” that would be required to pay for certain transmission upgrades approved through PJM’s Regional Transmission Expansion
  Planning (RTEP) process and the percentage of the project cost that would be allocated to such Responsible Customers. This was the first filing by PJM pursuant to these new cost allocation mechanisms
  and it included (i) large cost allocations to eastern load as a result of proposed construction in the western and southern portions of PJM and (ii) allocations to merchant transmission projects such as
  Neptune Regional Transmission System, LLC. On May 26, 2006, FERC issued an order that accepted and suspended PJM’s cost allocation filing, made the filing effective subject to refund as of May 30,
  2006 and established a hearing and settlement judicial procedure.

In addition, on May 4, 2006, PJM made a second RTEP cost allocation filing at FERC, addressing cost allocations to Responsible Customers associated with additional RTEP projects. PSEG protested
  the filing, objecting to, among other things, PJM’s netting of cost impacts within a PJM zone to allocate RTEP costs and PJM’s failure to consider the impact of certain adjustments in determining zonal cost
  allocation.

On July 19, 2006, FERC consolidated PJM’s January 5, 2006 and May 4, 2006 filings that propose to allocate the costs of new transmission projects that PJM has directed to be built through its RTEP
  process. On July 21, 2006, PJM submitted to FERC a further proposal to allocate the costs of an additional group of new transmission projects that PJM has directed be built through its RTEP. The July 21,
  2006 filing includes


allocations for the $850 million, 200-mile 500 kV Loudon transmission line which runs from Allegheny Power’s service territory, through West Virginia to Northern Virginia, as well as many other
  transmission projects in the PJM region. This proceeding was consolidated with the other two PJM cost allocation filings and was then the subject of settlement proceedings before a ALJ. Settlement
  discussions terminated in November 2006 and, on November 7, 2006, the proceedings were set for hearing, with a hearing to commence no later than June 19, 2007. PJM has used the same allocation
  methodology to identify which load should pay for these new transmission projects through regulated transmission rates. PSEG is actively participating in this proceeding, as the cost allocation methodology
  used by PJM may result in a disproportionate allocation of costs to loads in the eastern portion of PJM. However, assuming continued pass-through of transmission charges to retail customers, neither Power
  nor PSE&G are expected to be impacted by the allocation of Schedule 12 charges. PSEG, PSE&G and Power are unable to predict the outcome of this hearing at this time.

Regional through and out rates (RTOR)

RTOR are separate transmission rates for transactions where electricity originated in one transmission control area is transmitted to a point outside that control area. Both the Midwest Independent
  Transmission System Operator, Inc. (MISO) and PJM charged RTORs through December 1, 2004. FERC approved a new regional rate design, which became effective December 1, 2004 for the entire
  PJM/MISO region and approved the continuation of license plate rates and a transitional Seams Elimination Charge/Cost Adjustment/Assignment (SECA) methodology effective from December 1, 2004
  through March 2006.

On February 10, 2005, FERC issued an order that accepted various SECA filings, established December 2004 as the effective date for the SECA rates, made them subject to refund and surcharge, and
  established hearing procedures to resolve the outstanding factual issues raised in the filings and the responsive pleadings.

A trial-type hearing was held in May 2006, encompassing a review of the actual amount of lost revenues to be recovered via the SECA mechanism. On August 10, 2006, the ALJ issued an initial
  decision finding that the rate design for the recovery of SECA charges is flawed, and that the SECA rate charges are therefore unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory. FERC has not yet issued an
  order on review of the ALJ initial decision. In addition, in March 2006, PSE&G and Power entered into a settlement with a limited group of parties in PJM, which settlement was certified to FERC, under
  which the parties have agreed to pay and collect reductions of SECA revenues. On October 12, 2006, the limited settlement agreement was expanded to include additional parties and on January 18, 2007,
  an additional settlement agreement was entered into with certain MISO parties. FERC has not yet acted to approve the March, October or January SECA settlements. Due to the uncertainty of this
  proceeding, PSE&G has continued to defer the collection of any SECA revenues on its books. At the present time, PSEG, PSE&G and Power do not anticipate any adverse impact as a result of the SECA
  decision.

PJM Long-Term Transmission Rate Design

On May 31, 2005, FERC issued an order addressing the recovery of costs for transmission upgrades designated through PJM’s RTEP process. Among other matters, FERC’s order responded to a
  proposal to continue PJM’s current rate design, under which transmission customers pay rates within the particular transmission zone in which they take service. FERC concluded that the existing rate
  design may not be just and reasonable and it established a hearing to examine the justness and reasonableness of continuing PJM’s modified zonal rate design. Certain entities filed proposals with FERC on
  September 30, 2005 for alternative rate designs for the PJM region. PSE&G, as part of a coalition of potentially affected PJM transmission owners, filed answering testimony on November 22, 2005 that
  supported continuation of the zonal rate design in PJM.

A hearing was held in April 2006 and on July 13, 2006, a FERC ALJ issued a decision concluding that the existing PJM modified zonal rate design for existing facilities has been shown to be unjust and
  unreasonable, and should be replaced with a postage stamp rate design (single “postage stamp” rate paid by all transmission customers in PJM) for such facilities to be effective April 1, 2006. To mitigate
  rate impacts, the ALJ determined that the rate design should be phased in, so that no customer receives greater than a 10% annual rate increase. The ALJ also determined that the existing process for
  allocating costs of new transmission projects pursuant to Schedule 6 of PJM’s Operating Agreement and Schedule 12 of the PJM Tariff was just and reasonable. Briefs on exceptions to the ALJ’s initial
  decision and reply briefs were filed in this proceeding challenging the decision to find the existing rate design unjust and unreasonable, the appropriateness of imposing a postage stamp rate design, the
  decision as to the appropriateness of applying


the current Schedule 6 and Schedule 12 process for allocating costs of new transmission projects and the phase-in of the new rate design. FERC has not yet issued a decision on review of the ALJ’s initial
  decision. Should FERC ultimately approve this postage stamp rate design on review of the ALJ’s initial decision, or adopt one or a combination of the alternative rate designs proposed, assuming continued
  pass-through of transmission charges to retail customers, PSEG’s and PSE&G’s results of operations could be adversely impacted with no adverse impact currently anticipated for Power.

Market Power, Market Design and Capacity Issues

PSEG, PSE&G and Power

Market Power

Under FERC regulations, public utilities may sell power at cost-based rates or apply to FERC for authority to sell at market-based rates (MBR). PSE&G, ER&T and certain other subsidiaries of Fossil and
  Energy Holdings have applied for and received MBR authority from FERC, which permits them to sell power into the wholesale market at market-based rates. FERC requires that holders of MBR tariffs
  file an update, on a triennial basis, demonstrating that they continue to lack market power. On November 30, 2006, PSE&G and ER&T filed their respective triennial updated market power reports with FERC.
  FERC has not yet acted on these updated market power reports.

On May 19, 2006, FERC issued a NOPR concerning the standards to be used by FERC in granting market-based rate authority. The proposed regulations would adopt, in most respects, FERC’s
  current standards. In its NOPR, FERC suggests certain changes, such as in the areas of cost-based market power mitigation, modifications to the horizontal (generation) market power screens, and
  clarifications to existing vertical market power screens. On September 20, 2006, PSE&G and Power submitted comments in this NOPR proceeding. FERC has not yet issued a Final Rule in this rulemaking
  proceeding. The outcome of this proceeding and its impact on PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings cannot be predicted at this time, but Power does not expect the new rules to disqualify its MBR
  authority. However, no assurances can be given.

FERC’s MBR policies and the wholesale electricity markets which they help support are evolving and subject to change. Specifically, on December 19, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the
  Ninth Circuit overturned certain FERC orders in a series of cases, to which PSEG was not a party, which involved long term wholesale contracts entered into during the California Energy Crisis and, by so
  doing, seriously undermined the “contract sanctity” doctrine that had previously been applied to preserve these contracts. Moreover, the court held that FERC’s MBR policies are insufficient to establish
  that agreements reached under MBR tariffs are just and reasonable at the outset. Thus, the fact that a contract is entered into under a MBR tariff may not render it immune from “just and reasonable”
  review by FERC. This case will likely be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court but represents a significant development and is one that will be monitored for its impact on the wholesale electric market in the
  future.

RMR Status

PJM

Although applicable tariff provisions differ from region to region, RMR tariff provisions provide compensation to a generation owner when a unit proposed for retirement must continue operating for
  reliability purposes. In September 2004, Power filed notice with PJM that it was considering the retirement of seven generating units in New Jersey, effective December 7, 2004, due to concerns about the
  economic viability of the units under the then current market structure. The units that were being considered for retirement were Sewaren 1, 2, 3 and 4, Kearny 7 and 8 and Hudson 1. Kearny 7 and 8 were
  retired in 2005. In response to Power’s filed notice, PJM identified certain system reliability concerns associated with the proposed retirements.

Effective February 24, 2005, subject to refund and hearing, Power began to collect a monthly fixed payment of $3.3 million, pre-tax, net of operating margins for the Sewaren 1, 2, 3 and 4 and Hudson 1
  units. A detailed settlement was filed with FERC on September 23, 2005 that permits Power to recover annual fixed costs of approximately $19 million and $14.5 million, pre-tax, for the Sewaren and
  Hudson units, respectively, plus reimbursements of Power’s expenditures in connection with certain construction at the units that are necessary to maintain reliability, offset by certain revenues earned in
  PJM’s energy market.


FERC accepted this settlement retroactive to February 24, 2005. On March 28, 2006, Power filed a refund report with FERC pursuant to which Power refunded $11 million to PJM, although most of this
  refund related to the timing of payments under the settlement agreement and thus will be repaid to Power, with carrying charges, at a later date. FERC did not issue a public notice requesting comments on
  the report and no party has made any objections or other comments with respect to the report. Power is in the process of extending its RMR contract for Hudson Unit 1 through September 2010. For
  additional information, see Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes.

New England

In the New England electricity market, many owners of generation facilities have filed with FERC for RMR treatment under the NEPOOL Open Access Transmission Tariff. If FERC grants RMR
  status for a generation facility located in the New England market, the owner is entitled to receive cost-of-service treatment for its facility for the duration of an RMR contract that it enters into with ISO
  New England Inc. On November 17, 2004, PSEG Power Connecticut LLC (Power Connecticut), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Power, filed a request for RMR treatment for the New Haven Harbor
  generation station and Unit 2 at the Bridgeport Harbor generation station. FERC issued an order on January 14, 2005, subject to refund and hearing which allowed Power Connecticut to begin collecting
  monthly fixed payments of approximately $1.6 million and $3.9 million, pre-tax, for reliability services provided by the Bridgeport Harbor Station, Unit 2 and the New Haven Harbor Station, respectively,
  net of operating margins. On June 17, 2005, Power Connecticut filed revised studies supporting monthly recovery of $1.3 million and $3.3 million, pre-tax, for the Bridgeport Harbor and New Haven Harbor
  units, respectively.

On April 21, 2006, Power Connecticut, the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control, the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel and ISO New England Inc. filed with FERC a Joint
  Stipulation and Settlement Agreement and Motion for Expedited Consideration. The Joint Stipulation and Settlement settled all matters associated with the RMR agreements filed by Power Connecticut
  for its Bridgeport Harbor 2 and New Haven Harbor stations. Among other things, the settlement provides for monthly fixed payments of approximately $1 million for Bridgeport Harbor and $3 million for
  New Haven Harbor. The only disputed issues concern the standard of review applicable to certain types of potential tariff changes that could be filed in the future. No party has challenged the settlement
  rates proposed to become effective. The ALJ certified the settlement to FERC on June 21, 2006 as a contested offer of settlement. It is anticipated that the settlement will be approved as certified or, if
  modified, will not be modified in a manner that adversely affects the settlement rates. However, Power Connecticut cannot predict a final outcome at this time, as FERC has not yet acted to approve the
  settlement.

PJM Reliability Pricing Model (RPM)

On August 31, 2005, PJM filed its RPM with FERC. The RPM constitutes a locational installed capacity market design for the PJM region, including a forward auction for installed capacity priced
  according to a downward-sloping demand curve and a transitional implementation of the market design. FERC issued an order on April 20, 2006 that accepted most of the core concepts of the RPM filing
  with an implementation date of June 1, 2007. The April 20, 2006 order set certain details of the filing for paper hearing and technical conference procedures including the slope of the demand curve and the
  mechanism for identification of the locational capacity zones. Such hearing and technical conference procedures have now been completed. Also, commencing in June 2006, settlement discussions mediated
  by a FERC ALJ commenced at the request of certain intervenors. A final settlement was filed with FERC on September 29, 2006 with a requested approval date of no later than December 22, 2006. PSE&G
  and Power filed comments to the settlement supporting the basic structural elements of the RPM proposal but nonetheless requesting certain modifications which, in their view, would better promote the
  adequacy of generation reserves on a cost-effective basis. On December 22, 2006, FERC issued an order approving the September 29 settlement, with certain conditions. FERC’s approval of this settlement
  is expected to have a favorable impact on generation facilities located in constrained locational zones. The final revenue impact on Power of the settlement approved in the December 22, 2006 FERC order
  could result in incremental margin of $100 million to $150 million in 2007, with higher increases in future years as the full year impact is realized and existing capacity contracts expire. The April 20, 2006
  order remains subject to rehearing requests filed by several parties. Moreover, on January 22, 2007, PSEG as well as other parties to the proceeding filed for rehearing of the December 22, 2006 order.


Given the pending rehearing requests and the likelihood of eventual judicial appeals, PSEG, PSE&G and Power are unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding.

Forward Capacity Market (FCM) Settlement in New England

On January 31, 2006, certain interested market participants in New England agreed to a settlement in principle of litigation regarding the design of the region’s market for installed capacity, which
  would institute a transition period leading to the implementation of a new market design for capacity as early as 2010. Commencing in December 2006, all generators in New England began receiving fixed
  capacity payments that escalate gradually over the transition period. RMR contracts, such as Power’s, would continue to be effective until the implementation of the new market design. The new market
  design is expected to consist of a forward auction for installed capacity that is intended to recognize the locational value of generators on the system, and is expected to contain incentive mechanisms to
  encourage generator availability during generation shortages. During the transition period, these payments are expected to benefit Power’s Bridgeport Harbor 2 plant. The final version of the settlement was
  filed with FERC on March 6, 2006 and was approved by order dated June 16, 2006 finding that, as a package, the settlement represents a just and reasonable outcome. The settlement was contested by
  certain parties and a rehearing was sought of the June 16, 2006 order. On October 31, 2006, FERC denied rehearing and accepted the FCM settlement in a final order; the order, however, remains subject to
  judicial challenge.

Transmission Infrastructure

PSEG, PSE&G, and Power

RTEP

On September 8, 2006, PJM filed with FERC a proposal that would significantly modify its regional transmission planning process for economic transmission planning. Currently, the PJM RTEP
  identifies transmission that is needed to address reliability, operational performance and economic needs of the PJM region based on historic congestion. The PJM proposal sought to expand the economic portion of the RTEP by
  forecasting economic congestion over its transmission planning horizon, which, in 2006, PJM modified from five to 15 years. PSE&G and Power filed a protest to the PJM proposal requesting that FERC
  reject PJM’s proposal or set it for hearing. On November 21, 2006, FERC issued an order conditionally accepting PJM’s proposed changes to the RTEP for economic transmission planning. FERC directed PJM to make certain modifications to its proposal, including requiring PJM to make a compliance filing within 120 days identifying how it will weigh and/or combine the metrics it proposes for
  determining the net benefits of a particular project and to make a compliance filing within 90 days elaborating on the criteria it will use to determine if an alternative project is more “economic” than an
  RTEP project. Nonetheless, PJM’s changes to its economic transmission planning process may result in the establishment of a preference for rate-based transmission solutions to address congestion, as
  opposed to reliance on private investment and competitive non-transmission market solutions. PSE&G and Power filed for rehearing of the November 21, 2006 FERC order on December 21, 2006. FERC has
  not yet issued an order on rehearing. PSEG, PSE&G and Power are unable to predict the final outcome of this proceeding.

DOE Congestion Study

On August 8, 2006, the DOE issued a National Electric Transmission Congestion Study (Congestion Study), as directed by Congress in the EP Act. This Congestion Study identified two areas in the
  U.S. as “critical congestion areas;” one of the areas is the region between New York and Washington, D.C. Under the EP Act, the DOE has the ability to designate transmission corridors in these “critical
  congestion areas,” to which FERC back-stop transmission siting authority will attach. Thus, corridor designation may facilitate the construction of rate-based transmission projects to address congestion in
  these corridors. The DOE has not yet designated any transmission corridors as a result of this Congestion Study but will likely do so in the first quarter of 2007. PSE&G and Power filed comments to the
  Congestion Study, in which they contended that the Congestion Study contained several analytical flaws. PSEG, PSE&G and Power are unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding at this time.


LDV Complaint Proceeding

On December 30, 2004, Jersey Central Power & Light Company (JCP&L) filed a complaint at FERC against the other four signatories, including PSE&G, to the Lower Delaware Valley (LDV)
  Transmission System Agreement, which expires in 2027 and governs the construction of, and investment in, certain 500 kV transmission facilities in New Jersey. In the complaint proceeding, JCP&L seeks to
  terminate its payment obligations to the other contract signatories. A hearing was conducted in this proceeding in November 2006 and an initial decision is expected by the ALJ in March 2007. In this
  litigation, JCP&L is not only seeking to terminate its payment obligations to PSE&G of approximately $3 million per year through 2027, but also to receive credit from PSE&G and the other LDV Agreement
  parties for transmission facilities previously constructed by JCP&L in New Jersey; if the ALJ were to accept all of JCP&L’s crediting arguments, an outcome that is unlikely, PSE&G would owe approximately $5
  million to JCP&L under the LDV Agreement. PSE&G cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding at this time.

PJM Strategic Initiative

In the fourth quarter of 2006, PJM launched a “strategic initiative” to more specifically define its role in the evolving wholesale energy markets. As part of this initiative, PJM sought comments from its
  members, including PSEG, on a number of items, including whether PJM should consider splitting its wholesale market operations from its transmission grid operations and whether PJM should consider
  changes to its current corporate governance structure. PJM has since pulled back from its idea of splitting market and grid operations but continues to consider whether there is a need to modify aspects of
  its current market and governance structure. PSEG will continue to actively participate in these discussions.

NRC

PSEG and Power

Nuclear’s operation of nuclear generating facilities is subject to continuous regulation by the NRC, a federal agency established to regulate nuclear activities to ensure protection of public health and
  safety, as well as the security and protection of the environment. Such regulation involves testing, evaluation and modification of all aspects of plant operation in light of NRC safety and environmental
  requirements. Continuous demonstration to the NRC that plant operations meet requirements is also necessary. The NRC has the ultimate authority to determine whether any nuclear generating unit may
  operate. Power has recently commenced the process to extend the operating licenses for the Salem and Hope Creek facilities. The current operating licenses of Power’s nuclear facilities expire in the years
  shown below:

Facility

Year

Salem 1


Salem 2


Hope Creek


Peach Bottom 2


Peach Bottom 3


Nuclear Safety Issues

In January 2004, the NRC issued a letter requesting Power to conduct a review of its Salem and Hope Creek nuclear generation facilities to assess the workplace environment for raising and addressing
  safety issues. Power responded to the letter in February 2004 and had independent assessments of the work environment at both facilities performed which concluded that Salem and Hope Creek were safe
  for continued operations, but also identified issues that needed to be addressed. These facilities were under enhanced oversight by the NRC related to the work environment until August 31, 2006, at which
  time the NRC provided a letter informing Power that its mid-cycle performance review had concluded that the substantive cross-cutting issue in the safety-conscious work environment area at Salem and
  Hope Creek was closed. The NRC has restored Salem and Hope Creek to normal oversight levels.

Recirculation Pump

In a letter to the NRC dated January 9, 2005, Power committed to install vibration-monitoring equipment on Hope Creek’s “B” Reactor Recirculation Pump prior to the unit’s return to service to
  address pump vibration concerns and replace the pump’s shaft during the next refueling outage or any sooner outage of sufficient duration. This commitment was the subject of a January 11, 2005
  Confirmatory Action Letter


from the NRC. The shaft was replaced during the Hope Creek outage in April 2006. On April 20, 2006, the NRC issued a Closure of Confirmatory Action Letter indicating that all of the commitments were
  completed.

Other

PSE&G

Investment Tax Credits (ITC)

As of June 1999, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had issued several private letter rulings (PLRs) that concluded that the refunding of excess deferred tax and ITC balances to utility customers was
  permitted only over the related assets’ regulatory lives, which were terminated upon New Jersey’s electric industry deregulation. Based on this fact, PSEG and PSE&G reversed the deferred tax and ITC
  liability relating to PSE&G’s generation assets that were transferred to Power, and recorded a $235 million reduction of the extraordinary charge in 1999 due to the restructuring of the utility industry in New
  Jersey. PSE&G was directed by the BPU to seek a PLR from the IRS to determine if the ITC included in the impairment write-down of generation assets could be credited to customers without violating the
  tax normalization rules of the Internal Revenue Code. PSE&G filed a PLR request with the IRS in 2002.

On December 21, 2005, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) proposed new regulations for comment addressing the normalization of ITC, replacing regulations originally proposed in 2003.
  The new proposed regulations, if finalized, would not permit retroactive application. Accordingly, the IRS’s conclusions in the above referenced PLRs would continue to remain in effect for all industry
  deregulations prior to December 21, 2005.

On April 26, 2006, the BPU issued an order to PSE&G revoking its previous instruction and directing PSE&G to withdraw its request for a PLR by April 27, 2006. The BPU asserted that the Treasury’s
  proposed regulation project was the more appropriate authority to rely upon in deciding the ITC issue.

On May 1, 2006, PSE&G filed a motion for reconsideration with the BPU requesting that it modify its April 26, 2006 order to PSE&G to withdraw the PLR request. On May 5, 2006, the BPU denied
  PSE&G’s motion for reconsideration and reiterated its order to withdraw the PLR request. On May 8, 2006, PSE&G filed a petition with the Appellate Court of New Jersey challenging the BPU’s order to
  withdraw the PLR. On May 11, 2006, the IRS issued a PLR to PSE&G. The PLR concluded that none of the generation ITC could be passed to utility customers without violating the normalization rules.
  While the holding in the PLR is a favorable development for PSE&G, the outstanding Treasury regulation project could overturn the holding in the PLR if the Treasury were to alter the position set out in
  the December 21, 2005 proposed regulations. The issue cannot be fully resolved until the final Treasury regulations are issued.

On May 16, 2006, the BPU voted in favor of a special investigation and hearing before the BPU concerning PSE&G’s actions leading up to receiving the PLR, specifically its failure to abide by the BPU
  order to withdraw the request. An order detailing such special investigation has not yet been issued and no investigation has begun.

On October 13, 2006, the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey granted PSE&G’s motion to dismiss PSE&G’s appeal of the BPU’s order to withdraw the PLR since PSE&G has already
  received the PLR. The court also determined that if the BPU seeks to take future action against PSE&G based on the alleged violation of its order, PSE&G can restart the appeal.

State Regulation

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

The BPU is the regulatory authority that oversees electric and natural gas distribution companies in New Jersey. PSE&G is subject to comprehensive regulation by the BPU including, among other
  matters, regulation of retail electric and gas distribution rates and service and the issuance and sale of securities. Power’s partial ownership of generating facilities in Pennsylvania, as well as PSE&G’s
  ownership of certain transmission facilities in Pennsylvania, are subject to regulation by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PAPUC), which oversees retail electric and natural gas service in
  Pennsylvania. PSE&G and Power are also subject to rules and regulations of the NJDEP and the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT).


As discussed below, various Power subsidiaries and Energy Holdings’ subsidiaries are subject to some state regulation in other individual states where they operate facilities, including New York,
  Connecticut, Indiana, Texas, California, Hawaii and New Hampshire.

PUHCA Repeal

On August 1, 2005, the BPU initiated a proceeding to consider whether additional ratepayer protections were necessary in light of the repeal of PUHCA by the EP Act. The proceeding considered the
  BPU’s current authority to protect utility ratepayers from risks associated with a utility being part of a holding company structure. The BPU determined that additional protections were necessary and
  commenced a two phase rulemaking to address its view of potential risks associated with a utility being part of a holding company structure. Phase I of the rulemaking effort resulted in the adoption of new
  regulations effective October 2, 2006, addressing the diversification activities of New Jersey utilities and their holding companies. These new rules impose a requirement that each New Jersey public utility
  and its holding company ensure that the aggregate assets of all nonutility activities in the holding company system do not exceed a defined percentage (25%) of the aggregate assets of the utility and utility-
  related assets in the holding company system without BPU consent. The rules broadly define utility-related activities to include such things as the production, generation, transmitting, delivering, storing,
  selling, marketing of natural gas, propane, electricity and other fuels to wholesale or retail customers, energy management services and sale of energy appliances. Both PSE&G and PSEG currently satisfy
  these requirements and expect to continue to satisfy them based on the companies’ current business plans. However, constant monitoring will be required to ensure that the regulation is satisfied and to
  meet the annual certification process. The BPU is currently developing Phase II of the rulemaking in a stakeholder process. In Phase II the BPU is proposing new regulations that would increase the BPU’s
  access to books and records, impose restrictions on service agreements between utilities and their affiliated service companies and impose additional requirements on utility board of director composition,
  utility participation in money pools and additional reporting obligations.

New Jersey Energy Master Plan

The Governor of New Jersey has recently directed the BPU, in partnership with other New Jersey agencies, to develop an energy master plan. State law in New Jersey requires that an energy master
  plan be developed every three years, the purpose of which is to ensure safe, secure and reasonably-priced energy supply, foster economic growth and development and protect the environment. In the
  Governor’s directive regarding the energy master plan, the Governor established three specific goals: (1) reduce the State’s projected energy use by 20% by the year 2020; (2) supply 20% of the State’s
  electricity needs with certain renewable energy sources by 2020; and (3) emphasize energy efficiency, conservation and renewable energy resources to meet future increases in New Jersey electric demand
  without increasing New Jersey’s reliance on non-renewable resources. In November, PSEG submitted a number of strategies designed to improve efficiencies in customer use and increase the level of
  renewable generation. During January and February 2007, PSEG has been actively involved in the broad-based constituent working groups created to develop specific strategies to achieve the goals and
  objectives. Public meetings on the energy master plan are expected take place during the first and second quarters of 2007, and a final plan is expected to be completed by October 2007. The outcome of this proceeding and
  its impact on PSEG, PSE&G and Power cannot be predicted at this time.

PSE&G and Power

BGS Auctions

All of New Jersey’s EDCs jointly procure the supply to meet their BGS obligations through two concurrent auctions authorized by the BPU for New Jersey’s total BGS requirement. Results of these
  auctions determine which energy suppliers are authorized to supply BGS to New Jersey’s EDCs. Certain conditions are required to participate in these auctions. Energy suppliers must agree to execute the
  BGS Master Service Agreement, provide required security within three days of BPU certification of auction results and satisfy certain creditworthiness requirements.

In 2006, the BPU initiated a proceeding to review the annual BGS procurement process as well as the policy issues thereto for all of the New Jersey EDCs. In June 2006, the BPU ruled on certain
  issues regarding the acquisition of BGS for the period beginning in June 2007. The BPU agreed that a descending clock auction format should be used for the procurement of BGS-FP supply for 2007.


On July 10, 2006, PSE&G filed the Joint EDC proposal for the procurement of BGS for the period beginning June 1, 2007. This proposal includes a descending clock auction format to be held in
  February 2007 for the procurement of all BGS supply. On October 28, 2006, the BPU approved a descending clock auction format for BGS-FP and BGS-CIEP supply for the period beginning June 1, 2007.
  On December 22, 2006, the BPU approved the remainder of the items in the EDCs filing, without material changes. The BPU also directed the EDCs to remit all remaining retail margin monies previously
  collected from larger customers to the State Treasurer in January 2007, and to remit any future collections of the retail margin to the State Treasurer on a quarterly basis. In 2003, the BPU directed the
  EDCs to collect a 0.5 per kWh retail adder from all BGS customers greater than 750 kW. These monies were held in a regulatory liability account. For additional information see Note 5 Regulatory Matters
  and Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes.

PSE&G

Electric Distribution Financial Review

Based on the Electric Base Rate Case approved in July 2003, PSE&G recorded a regulatory liability in the second quarter of 2003 by reducing its depreciation reserve for its electric distribution assets by
  $155 million and amortized this liability from August 1, 2003 through December 31, 2005. The $64 million annual amortization of this liability resulted in a reduction of Depreciation and Amortization
  expense. PSE&G filed for a $64 million (based on 2003 test year sales volumes) annual increase in electric distribution rates effective January 1, 2006, subject to BPU approval, including a review of PSE&G’s
  earnings and other relevant financial information. Based on current sales volumes, the amount approximates $69 million.

On November 9, 2006, the BPU approved a settlement agreement reached by the parties to the proceeding authorizing a $22 million reduction to electric distribution rates, resulting in additional
  revenue to PSE&G of approximately $47 million annually based on current sales volumes.

The settlement includes a restriction against any further base rate changes becoming effective before November 15, 2009. In addition, PSE&G must file a joint electric and gas petition for any future base
  rate increases.

BGSS Filings

The parties to the 2005/2006 BGSS proceeding entered into a Stipulation in which the parties agreed that the BGSS Commodity Charge increases of September 1, 2005 and December 15, 2005 that
  were previously approved by the BPU on a provisional basis should become final. The BPU approved the Stipulation. In addition, all the remaining gas contract issues were also resolved and an amended
  Gas Requirements Contract was attached to the Stipulation and also approved by the BPU. The primary changes were the term was extended by five years and the default provision was changed from three
  days to one day.

PSE&G made its 2006/2007 BGSS filing on May 26, 2006. In this filing, PSE&G requested a reduction in annual BGSS gas revenues of approximately $19.7 million (excluding losses and New Jersey Sales
  and Use Tax) or approximately a 1.0% decrease to be implemented for service rendered on and after October 1, 2006 or earlier. Additionally, PSE&G requested an increase in its Balancing Charge. The
  combined impact of both changes for the class average residential heating customer is an increase in the winter monthly bills of approximately 0.1%; however, on an annual basis the impact is a decrease of
  approximately 0.2%.

The parties entered into a Stipulation to make the filed BGSS rate effective October 1, 2006 on a provisional basis. However, since the time of the filing, prices of gas futures have dropped significantly
  and as a result, additional BGSS data has been requested by and provided to the BPU. Settlement discussions with the BPU Staff were completed and a new Stipulation, dated October 27, 2006, was
  executed by the parties. This new Stipulation was approved by the BPU and results in a decrease in annual BGSS revenues of approximately $120 million, which is approximately a 6% reduction in a typical
  residential gas customer’s bill. The new BGSS rate became effective on November 9, 2006. The Stipulation did not include any change in the Balancing Charge.

The parties entered into a second Stipulation, which addresses the Balancing Charge only. The BPU Staff recommended a lower Balancing Charge than proposed by the Company and received
  agreement from Rate Counsel. The parties executed the Stipulation for the lower rate and BPU approval was received on January 17, 2007.


Remediation Adjustment Clause (RAC) Filing

PSE&G is engaged in a program to address potential environmental concerns regarding its former Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP) properties in cooperation with and under the supervision of NJDEP.
  The costs of the program are recovered through the Remediation Adjustment Clause (RAC). The RAC addresses costs in annual periods ending July 31st of each year. The expenditures in each RAC
  period are recovered over seven years. The costs of the program, including interest, are deferred and amortized as collected in revenues.

On December 5, 2005 the BPU approved for recovery $18 million for the RAC-12 remediation expenditures incurred from August 1, 2003 through July 31, 2004. No change in the RAC recovery factor
  was required.

In February 2007, PSE&G submitted its RAC-13 and RAC-14 filings with the BPU. In these filings, PSE&G seeks an order finding that the $71 million of RAC program costs incurred during the two-year
  period, August 1, 2004 through July 31, 2006, are reasonable and are available for recovery. PSE&G proposes that the current gas and electric RAC rates be reduced by approximately $18 million annually,
  effective July 1, 2007.

Gas Base Rate Case

On September 30, 2005, PSE&G filed a petition with the BPU seeking an overall 3.78% increase in its gas base rates to cover the cost of gas delivery to be effective June 30, 2006. Approximately $55
  million of the $133 million request was for an increase in book depreciation rates.

On November 9, 2006, the BPU approved a settlement agreement reached by the parties to the proceeding. The agreement provides for an annual increase in gas revenues of $40 million or
  approximately 1.1%. In addition, the settlement provides for an adjustment to lower book depreciation and amortization expense for PSE&G by approximately $26 million annually and the amortization of
  accumulated cost of removal that will further reduce depreciation and amortization expense by $13 million annually for five years.

The settlement includes a restriction against any further base rate changes becoming effective before November 15, 2009. In addition, PSE&G must file a joint electric and gas petition for any future base
  rate increases.

Societal Benefits Clause (SBC) Filing

On August 12, 2005, PSE&G filed a motion with the BPU seeking approval of changes in its electric and gas SBC rates and its electric non-utility generation transition charge (NTC) rates. For electric
  customers, the rates proposed were designed to recover approximately $106 million in SBC revenues offset by lower NTC rates of $93 million beginning January 1, 2006. For gas, the rates proposed were
  designed to recover approximately $10 million in SBC revenues. In 2006, PSE&G filed updates to its filing, modifying its requested changes to electric SBC/NTC rates and gas SBC rates. Public hearings were
  held and settlement discussions began on outstanding issues. On January 19, 2007, settlement documents were filed with the ALJ, which upon approval, would result in an annual increase of approximately
  $16 million in electric SBC/NTC revenues and $12 million in gas SBC revenues.

Deferral Audit

The BPU Energy and Audit Division conducts audits of deferred balances. A draft Deferral Audit—Phase II report relating to the 12-month period ended July 31, 2003 was released by the consultant to
  the BPU in April 2005. The draft report addressed the SBC, Market Transition Charge (MTC) and Non-Utility Generation (NUG) deferred balances. The consultant to the BPU found that the Phase II
  deferral balances complied in all material respects with the BPU orders regarding such deferrals, the consultant noted that the BPU Staff had raised certain questions with respect to the reconciliation
  method PSE&G employed in calculating the overrecovery of its MTC and other charges during the Phase I and Phase II four-year transition period. For additional information regarding PSE&G’s Deferral
  Audit, see Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes.


Gas Purchasing Strategies Audit

In January 2007, the BPU has issued an RFP to solicit bid proposals to engage a contractor to perform an analysis of the gas purchasing practices and hedging strategies of the four New Jersey gas
  distribution companies (GDC’s), including PSE&G. The primary focus will be to examine and compare the financial and physical hedging policies and practices of each GDC and to provide recommendations
  for improvements to these policies and practices. PSE&G cannot predict the outcome of this process.

New Jersey Clean Energy Program

In December 2004, the BPU has approved a funding requirement for each New Jersey utility applicable to Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency programs for the years 2005 through 2008. The
  State of New Jersey has awarded contracts to two market managers, TRC Energy Services and Honeywell Utility Solutions to take over program management functions from the utilities. This transition is
  now expected to take place in the first half of 2007. For additional information regarding PSE&G’s Clean Energy Program, see Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes.

Power

Connecticut

Legislation has been introduced in the Connecticut General Assembly that would impose a tax on electric generators of 50% on earnings above a 20% return on equity. Proceeds from this proposed
  “windfall profits tax” would be used to provide consumer rate relief. Legislation also has been introduced that would allow the state’s electric utility companies to build and place into rate base up to 300
  megawatts of peaking electric generation.

Neither PSEG nor Power is able to predict whether any of such proposals will be enacted into law or their impact, if any, or whether similar initiatives may be considered in other jurisdictions.

Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC)

To reduce the impact of federally-mandated congestion charges on Connecticut ratepayers, Connecticut has launched a procurement process to facilitate the development of incremental generation
  capacity, as authorized by legislation which permits the DPUC to establish a competitive procurement process intended to encourage new supply-side and demand-side resources. Specifically, the DPUC is
  required to develop and issue a request for proposals (RFP) to solicit the development of long-term projects, with local distribution companies serving as the counterparties to these contracts. The impact of
  this RFP process on Power Connecticut’s assets is unclear at the present time.

Energy Holdings

Texas

Global’s generation business in Texas (TIE) is a merchant generation business that participates, through its subsidiaries, Odessa-Ector Power Partners, L.P. (Odessa) and Guadalupe Power Partners, LP
  (Guadalupe), in the Texas wholesale energy market administered by ERCOT. Under the regulation of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, ERCOT performs three main roles in managing the electric
  power grid and marketplace: ensuring that the grid can accommodate scheduled energy transfers, ensuring grid reliability, and overseeing retail transactions. While neither TIE, Odessa nor Guadalupe are
  public utilities subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, they are subject to FERC jurisdiction for purposes of complying with NERC’s Reliability Standards (see discussion in Federal
  Regulation—Compliance—Reliability Standards).

Like other energy markets, energy prices in ERCOT have risen over the past few years due, in large measure, to higher fuel costs. In an attempt to lower electricity prices, the legislature in Texas is
  currently examining proposals for draft legislation that could affect the Texas market. PSEG does not know at this time if any legislation will ultimately pass, or if it does, what its effect will be on Global’s
  generation business in Texas.


International Regulation

Energy Holdings

Global

Global’s electric distribution facilities in South America are rate-regulated enterprises. Rates charged to customers are established by government authorities and are viewed by Global as currently
  sufficient to cover operating costs and provide a return on its investments. Global can give no assurances that future rates will be established at levels sufficient to cover such costs, provide a return on its
  investments or generate adequate cash flow to pay principal and interest on its debt or to enable it to comply with the terms of its debt agreements.

Chile

Distribution companies in Chile, including Chilquinta Energia S.A. (Chilquinta) and associated companies, Sociedad Austral de Electricidad S.A. (SAESA) and other members of the SAESA Group,
  are subject to rate regulation by the Comision Nacional de Energia (CNE), a national governmental regulatory authority. The Chilean regulatory framework has been in existence since 1982, with rates set
  every four years based on a model company for each typical concession area. The tariff which distribution companies charge to regulated customers consists of two components: the actual cost of energy
  purchased and an additional amount to compensate for the value added in distribution (DVA tariff). The DVA tariff considers allowed losses incurred in the distribution of electricity, administrative costs
  of providing service to customers, costs of maintaining and operating the distribution systems and an annual return on investment between 6% to 14% over inflation applied to the replacement cost of
  distribution assets. Changes in electricity distribution companies’ cost of energy are passed through to customers, with no impact on the distributors’ margins (equal to the DVA tariff). Therefore,
  distributors, including members of the SAESA Group and Chilquinta, should not be affected by changes in the generation sector which affect prices. The most recent tariff adjustments for members of the
  SAESA Group and Chilquinta occurred in 2004 and have been reviewed and approved by the CNE.

In addition, the first auction for long-term supply contracts for Chilean distribution companies was simultaneously conducted during 2006. SAESA and Chilquinta were successful in contracting for
  approximately 2,900 Gwh/yr and 800 Gwh/yr, respectively from various generation companies to supply their regulated customers needs starting in 2010 and continuing through 2020 and 2025 for SAESA and Chilquinta, respectively. A
  second auction process for additional needs for Chilquinta (approximately 1,800 Gwh/year) will be held during 2007.

Peru

Distribution companies in Peru, including Luz del Sur S.A.A. (LDS), are subject to tariff regulation by the Organismo Supervisor de la Inversion en Energia, a national governmental regulatory
  authority. The Peruvian regulatory framework has been in existence since 1992, with tariffs set every four years based on a model company. The tariff which distribution companies charge to regulated
  customers consists of two components: the actual cost of energy purchased plus an additional amount to compensate for the DVA tariff. The DVA tariff considers allowed losses incurred in the distribution
  of electricity, administrative costs of providing service to customers, costs of maintaining and operating the distribution systems and an annual return on investment of 8% to 16% over inflation, based on
  the replacement cost of distribution assets. Changes in electricity distribution companies’ cost of energy are passed through to customers, with no impact on the distributors’ margins (equal to the DVA
  tariff). Therefore, distributors, including LDS, should not be affected by changes in the generation sector, which affect prices. The most recent tariff adjustments for LDS occurred in connection with the
  2005 tariff-setting process. New tariffs were effective as of November 1, 2005.

In addition, in accordance with local regulations, an auction was conducted at the end of December 2006 for prospective energy supply requirements for LDS. The total amount bid by Peruvian power
  producers was 650 MW of capacity. This supply combined with the contracts still in force are expected to be sufficient to meet LDS’s energy supply needs for 2007. In order to secure the growing supply
  needs for 2008 and beyond, management plans to conduct additional energy supply auctions, as necessary, during 2007. Management is concurrently exploring the feasibility of other forms of bilateral supply
  contracts, as well as advocating the extension of a law beyond December 2007, which currently allows LDS and other distribution companies without supply contracts, to draw energy from the grid, as
  required, at regulated prices to satisfy the regulated market’s demand.


SEGMENT INFORMATION

Financial information with respect to the business segments of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings is set forth in Note 18. Financial Information by Business Segment of the Notes.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

Federal, regional, state and local authorities regulate the environmental impacts of PSEG’s operations within the U.S. Laws and regulations particular to the region, country or locality where PSEG’s
  operations are located govern the environmental impacts associated with its foreign operations. For both domestic and foreign operations, areas of regulation may include air quality, water quality, site
  remediation, land use, waste disposal, aesthetics, impact on global climate and other matters.

To the extent that environmental requirements are more stringent and compliance more costly in certain states where PSEG operates compared to other states that are part of the same market, such
  rules may impact its ability to compete within that market. Due to evolving environmental regulations, it is difficult to project expected costs of compliance and its impact on competition. For additional
  information related to environmental matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

PSEG, Power and Energy Holdings

Air Pollution Control

The Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) and its implementing regulations require controls of emissions from sources of air pollution and also impose record keeping, reporting and permit requirements.
  Facilities in the U.S. that Power and Energy Holdings operate or in which they have an ownership interest are subject to these Federal requirements, as well as requirements established under state and
  local air pollution laws applicable where those facilities are located. Capital costs of complying with air pollution control requirements through 2010 are included in Power’s estimate of construction
  expenditures in Item 7. MD&A—Capital Requirements.

Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)/New Source Review (NSR)

The PSD/NSR regulations, promulgated under the Clean Air Act (CAA), require major sources of certain air pollutants to obtain permits, install pollution control technology and obtain offsets, in
  some circumstances, when those sources undergo a “major modification,” as defined in the regulations. The Federal government may order companies not in compliance with the PSD/NSR regulations to
  install the best available control technology at the affected plants and to pay monetary penalties of up to approximately $27,500 for each day of continued violation.

The EPA and the NJDEP issued a demand in March 2000 under the CAA requiring information to assess whether projects completed since 1978 at the Hudson and Mercer coal-burning units were
  implemented in accordance with applicable PSD/NSR regulations. Power completed its response to requests for information and, in January 2002, reached an agreement with the NJDEP and the EPA to
  resolve allegations of noncompliance with PSD/NSR regulations. Under that agreement, over the course of 10 years, Power agreed to install advanced air pollution controls to reduce emissions of Sulfur
  Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Oxide (NOx), particulate matter and mercury from the coal-burning units at the Mercer and Hudson generating stations to ensure compliance with PSD/NSR. Power also agreed to
  spend at least $6 million on supplemental environmental projects and pay a $1 million civil penalty. The agreement resolving the NSR allegations concerning the Hudson and Mercer coal-fired units also
  resolved a dispute over Bergen 2 regarding the applicability of PSD requirements and allowed construction of the unit to be completed and operations to commence.

Power notified the EPA and the NJDEP that it was evaluating the continued operation of the Hudson coal unit in light of changes in the energy and capacity markets, increases in the cost of pollution
  control equipment and other necessary modifications to the unit. On November 30, 2006, Power, reached an agreement with the EPA and NJDEP on an amendment to its 2002 agreement intended to
  achieve the emissions reductions targets of this agreement while providing more time to assess the feasibility of installing additional advanced emissions controls at Hudson.


The amended agreement with the EPA and the NJDEP will allow Power to continue operating Hudson and extend for four years the deadline for installing environmental controls beyond the previous
  December 31, 2006 deadline. Power will be required to undertake a number of technology projects (SCRs, scrubbers, baghouses, and carbon injection), plant modifications, and operating procedure changes
  at Hudson and Mercer designed to meet targeted reductions in emissions of NOx, SO2, particulate matter, and mercury. In addition, Power has agreed to notify the EPA and NJDEP by the end of 2007
  whether it will install the additional emissions controls at Hudson by the end of 2010, or plan for the orderly shut down of the unit.

Under the program to date, Power has installed Selective Catalytic Reduction Systems (SCRs) at Mercer at a cost of approximately $113 million. The cost of implementing the balance of the amended
  agreement at Mercer and Hudson is estimated at $400 million to $500 million for Mercer and at $600 million to $750 million for Hudson and will be incurred in the 2007-2010 timeframe. As part of the
  agreement, Fossil has agreed to purchase and retire emissions allowances, contribute approximately $3 million for programs to reduce particulate emissions from diesel engines in New Jersey, and pay a $6
  million civil penalty.

SO


/ NO

x

To reduce emissions of SO2 for acid rain prevention, the CAA sets a cap on total SO2 emissions from affected units and allocates SO2 allowances (each allowance authorizes the emission of one ton of
  SO2) to those units. Generation units with emissions greater than their allocations can obtain allowances from sources that have excess allowances. At this time, Power does not expect to incur material
  expenditures to continue complying with the acid rain SO2 emissions program.

The EPA has issued regulations (commonly known as the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call) requiring 19 states in the eastern half of the U.S. and the District of Colombia to reduce and cap
  NOx emissions from power plant and industrial sources. The NOx reduction requirements are consistent with requirements already in place in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, and
  therefore have not had an additional impact on the capacity available from Power’s facilities in those states. Power has been implementing measures to reduce NOx emissions at several of its units
  (including the installation of selective catalytic reduction systems at the Mercer Generating Station), which has reduced the impact of any further increases to the costs of allowances.

In 1997, the EPA adopted a new air quality standard for fine particulate matter and a revised air quality standard for ozone. In 2004, the EPA identified and designated areas of the U.S. that fail to
  meet the revised federal health standard for ozone or the new federal health standard for fine particulates. States are expected to develop regulatory measures necessary to achieve and maintain the health
  standards, which may require reductions in NOx and SO2 emissions. Additional NOx and SO2 reductions also may be required to satisfy requirements of an EPA rule protecting visibility in many of the
  nation’s Class 1 (pristine) environmental areas. Most of Power’s fossil facilities would be affected by this initiative.

In May 2005, the EPA published the final Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) that identifies 28 states and the District of Columbia as contributing significantly to the levels of fine particulates and/or
  eight-hour ozone in downwind states. New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Texas and Connecticut are among the states the EPA lists in the CAIR. Based on state obligations to address interstate
  transport of pollutants under the CAA, the EPA has proposed a two-phased emission reduction program for NOx and SO2, with Phase 1 beginning in 2009 (NOx) and 2010 (SO2) and Phase 2 beginning in
  2015. The EPA is recommending that the program be implemented through a cap-and-trade program, although states are not required to proceed in this manner.

In December 2005, the EPA proposed new National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter.

Power is unable to determine whether any costs it may incur to comply with the above standards would be material.

Carbon Dioxide (CO


) Emissions

Several states, primarily in the Northeastern U.S., are developing state-specific or regional legislative initiatives to stimulate CO2 emissions reductions in the electric power industry. New York initiated
  the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in April 2003. Currently, in the RGGI, seven Northeastern states have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) intended to cap and reduce CO2
  emissions from the electric power sector in the RGGI region. A final model rule was issued on August 15, 2006 that includes


MOU commitments and makes recommendations for states to move forward. The model rule contemplates the creation of a CO


allowance allocation and auction whereby CO


generators in the electric
  power industry would be expected to acquire through allocation, or purchase through an auction, CO


allowances in an amount corresponding to each facility’s emissions. Facilities with an insufficient
  number of allowances would be required to purchase additional allowances. New York has publicly announced its intent to subject 100% of the allowances to auction, and other states, including New Jersey,
  may do the same. States are expected to enact legislation and/or regulation representing, at least, the minimum requirements stipulated in the MOU. The RGGI program is scheduled to start in 2009. The
  NJDEP in 2005 finalized amendments to its regulations governing air pollution control that would designate CO


as an air contaminant subject to regulation. In February 2007, the Governor of New Jersey
  issued an executive order committing the State to reduce emissions of greenhouse gasses 20% by 2020 and 80% by 2050. The outcome of this initiative cannot be determined at this time; however, adoption
  of stringent CO


emissions reduction requirements in the Northeast, including the allocation of allowances to PSEG’s facilities and the prices of allowances available through auction, could materially
  impact Power’s operation of its fossil fuel-fired electric generating units.

Other Air Pollutants

In March 2005, the EPA promulgated two rules: one revising its December 2000 determination that Hazardous Air Pollutants from coal-fired and oil-fired Electric Generating Units (EGUs) should be
  regulated under section 112 of the CAA and, on that basis, removing those units from the section 112(c) source category list (known as the delisting rule); the second establishing a New Source Performance
  Standard limit for nickel emissions from oil-fired EGUs, and a cap-and-trade program for mercury emissions from coal-fired EGUs, with a first phase cap of 38 tons per year (tpy) in 2010 and a second
  phase cap of 15 tpy in 2018 (the ‘cap-and-trade rule’). The EPA determined that it would not regulate other emissions from coal-fired and oil-fired EGUs.

A number of environmental and medical groups, the city of Baltimore and a total of 16 states (all six New England states, New Jersey, California, Delaware, Illinois, New Mexico, New York,
  Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin) have sued the EPA challenging that the rules should be more restrictive. The environmental petitioners, but not the states, also sought a stay of the rules
  from both the agency and the court, but the request was denied. The outcome of these litigations cannot be determined at this time.

New Jersey and Connecticut have adopted standards for the reduction of emissions of mercury from coal-fired electric generating units. The Connecticut legislation requires coal-fired power plants in
  Connecticut to achieve either an emissions limit or a 90% mercury removal efficiency through technology installed to control mercury emissions effective in July 2008. The regulations in New Jersey require
  coal-fired electric generating units in New Jersey to meet certain emission limits or reduce emissions by 90% by December 15, 2007. Companies that are parties to multi-pollutant reduction agreements are
  permitted to postpone such reductions on half of their coal-fired electric generating capacity until December 15, 2012. Power has a multi-pollutant reduction agreement with the NJDEP as a result of a
  consent decree that resolved issues arising out of the PSD and NSR air pollution control programs at the Hudson, Mercer and Bergen facilities. Substantial uncertainty exists regarding the feasibility of
  achieving the reductions in mercury emissions required by the New Jersey regulations and Connecticut statute; however, the estimated costs of technology believed to be capable of meeting these emissions
  limits at Power’s coal-fired unit in Connecticut by July 2008 and at its Mercer Station by December 15, 2007 are included in Power’s capital expenditure forecast.

Water Pollution Control

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) prohibits the discharge of pollutants to waters of the U.S. from point sources, except pursuant to a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
  System (NPDES) permit issued by the EPA or by a state under a federally authorized state program. The FWPCA authorizes the imposition of technology-based and water quality-based effluent limits to
  regulate the discharge of pollutants into surface waters and ground waters. The EPA has delegated authority to a number of state agencies, including the NJDEP, to administer the NPDES program through
  state acts. The New Jersey Water Pollution Control Act (NJWPCA) authorizes the NJDEP to implement regulations and to administer the NPDES program with EPA oversight, and to issue and enforce
  New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) permits. Power and Energy Holdings also have ownership interests in domestic facilities in


other jurisdictions that have their own laws and implement regulations to control discharges to their surface waters and ground waters that directly govern Power’s or Energy Holdings’ facilities in these
  jurisdictions.

The EPA promulgated regulations under FWPCA Section 316(b), which requires that cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available (BTA) for minimizing ‘adverse environmental
  impact.’ Phase I of the rule covering new facilities became effective on January 17, 2002. None of the projects that Power currently has under construction or in development is subject to the Phase I rule.
  The Phase II rule covering large existing power plants became effective on September 7, 2004. The Phase II regulations provided five alternative methods by which a facility can demonstrate that it complies
  with the requirement for BTA for minimizing adverse environmental impacts associated with cooling water intake structures.

On January 25, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued its decision in litigation of the Phase II rule brought by several environmental groups, the Attorneys General of six
  Northeastern states, the Utility Water Act Group and several of its members, including Power. The court remanded major portions of the rule and determined that Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act
  does not support the use of restoration and the site specific cost-benefit test. Among the provisions the court remanded back to EPA for further consideration and rulemaking, the court instructed EPA to
  reconsider the definition of BTA without comparing the costs of the best performing technology to its benefits. Prior to this decision, Power has used restoration and site-specific cost benefit tests in
  applications it has filed to renew the NJPDES permits at its once-though cooled plants, including Salem, Hudson and Mercer. Although the rule applies to all of Power’s electric generating units that use
  surface waters for once-through cooling purposes, the impact of the rule and the decision of the court cannot be determined at this time for all of Power’s facilities. Depending on the outcome of any
  appeals, or actions by EPA to repromulgate the rule, this decision could have a material impact on Power’s ability to renew its NPDES permits at its larger once-through cooled plants, including Salem,
  Hudson, Mercer, New Haven and Bridgeport, without making significant upgrades to their existing intake structures and cooling systems. The costs of those upgrades could be material to one or more of Power’s once-through
  cooled plants.

Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act (Spill Act)

CERCLA and the Spill Act authorize Federal and state trustees for natural resources to assess damages against persons who have discharged a hazardous substance, causing an injury to natural
  resources. Pursuant to the Spill Act, the NJDEP requires persons conducting remediation to characterize injuries to natural resources and to address those injuries through restoration or damages. The
  NJDEP adopted regulations concerning site investigation and remediation that require an ecological evaluation of potential damages to natural resources in connection with an environmental investigation
  of contaminated sites. In 2003, the NJDEP issued a policy directive memorializing its efforts to recover natural resource damages and its intent to continue to pursue the recovery of natural resource
  damages. The NJDEP also issued guidance to assist parties in calculating their natural resource damage liability for settlement purposes, but has stated that those calculations are applicable only for those
  parties that volunteer to settle a claim for natural resource damages before a claim is asserted by the NJDEP. PSE&G and Power cannot assess the magnitude of the potential financial impact of this
  regulatory change. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes for additional information.

Because of the nature of PSE&G’s and Power’s respective businesses, including the production and delivery of electricity, the distribution of gas and, formerly, the manufacture of gas, various by-
  products and substances are or were produced or handled that contain constituents classified by Federal and state authorities as hazardous. For discussions of these hazardous substance issues and a
  discussion of potential liability for remedial action regarding the Passaic River, see Note 12. Commitments and Contingent


Liabilities of the Notes. For a discussion of remediation/clean-up actions involving PSE&G and Power, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund

In accordance with the EP Act, domestic entities that own nuclear generating stations are required to pay into a decontamination and decommissioning fund, based on their past purchases of U.S.
  government enrichment services. Since these amounts are being collected from PSE&G’s customers over a period of 15 years, this obligation remained with PSE&G following the generation asset transfer to
  Power in 2000. PSE&G’s obligation for the nuclear generating stations in which it had an interest was $76 million (adjusted for inflation). As of December 31, 2006, PSE&G and Power had both paid their
  remaining obligations.

New Jersey Operating Permits

The New Jersey Air Pollution Control Act requires that certain sources of air emissions obtain operating permits issued by NJDEP. All of Power’s generating facilities in New Jersey are required to
  have such operating permits. The costs of compliance associated with any new requirements that may be imposed by these permits in the future are not known at this time and are not included in capital
  expenditures, but may be material.

Power

Nuclear Fuel Disposal

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended (NWPA), the Federal government has entered into contracts with the operators of nuclear power plants for transportation and ultimate
  disposal of spent nuclear fuel. To pay for this service, nuclear plant owners are required to contribute to a Nuclear Waste Fund at a rate of one mil ($0.001) per kWh of nuclear generation, subject to such
  escalation as may be required to assure full cost recovery by the Federal government. Under the NWPA, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) was required to begin taking possession of the spent nuclear
  fuel by no later than 1998. The DOE has announced that it does not expect a facility for such purpose to be available earlier than 2017.

Pursuant to NRC rules, spent nuclear fuel generated in any reactor can be stored in reactor facility storage pools or in independent spent fuel storage installations located at reactors or away-from-
  reactor sites for at least 30 years beyond the licensed life for reactor operation (which may include the term of a revised or renewed license). Adequate spent fuel storage capacity is estimated to be available
  through 2011 for Salem 1 and 2015 for Salem 2. Power completed, in August 2006,

construction of an on-site storage facility that will satisfy the spent fuel storage needs of Hope Creek through the end of its
  current license. Exelon Generation has advised Power that it has a licensed and operational on-site storage facility at Peach Bottom that will satisfy Peach Bottom’s spent fuel storage requirements until at
  least 2014.

Exelon Generation had previously advised Power that it had signed an agreement with the DOE, applicable to Peach Bottom, under which Exelon Generation would be reimbursed for costs incurred
  resulting from the DOE’s delay in accepting spent nuclear fuel for permanent storage. Future costs incurred resulting from the DOE delays in accepting spent fuel will be reimbursed annually until the
  DOE fulfills its obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel. In addition, Exelon Generation and Nuclear are required to reimburse the DOE for the previously received credits from the Nuclear Waste Fund,
  plus lost earnings. Under this settlement, Power received approximately $27 million for its share of previously incurred storage costs for Peach Bottom, $22 million of which was used for the required
  reimbursement to the Nuclear Waste Fund. Exelon Generation paid Power approximately $5.4 million for its portion of the spent fuel storage costs reimbursed by the DOE in 2005 for costs incurred
  between October 1, 2003 and June 30, 2005.

In September 2001, Power filed a complaint in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims seeking damages for Salem and Hope Creek caused by the DOE not taking possession of spent nuclear fuel in 1998. On
  October 14, 2004, an order to show cause was issued regarding whether the U.S. Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over the matter. Power responded to this order in November 2004. On January 31,
  2005, the Court dismissed the breach-of-contract claims of Power and three other utilities. Power moved for reconsideration in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims and jointly petitioned for permission to
  appeal the January 31, 2005 order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On September 29, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the adverse U.S. Court of Federal
  Claims jurisdictional


ruling and reinstated Power’s claims in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. No assurances can be given as to any damage recovery or the ultimate availability of a disposal facility.

Spent Fuel Pool

The spent fuel pool at each Salem unit has an installed leakage collection system. This system was found to be obstructed at Salem Unit 1. Power developed a solution to maintain the design function of
  the leakage collection system at Salem Unit 1 and investigated the existence of any structural degradation that might have been caused by the obstruction. The concrete and reinforcing steel laboratory tests
  results were completed in March 2006. Test results that have been collected as part of the ongoing testing indicate that no repairs are anticipated. The NRC issued Information Notice 2004-05 in March 2004
  concerning this emerging industry issue and Power cannot predict what further actions the NRC may take on this matter.

Elevated concentrations of tritium in the shallow groundwater at Salem Unit 1 were detected in early 2003. This information was reported to the NJDEP and the NRC, as required. Power conducted a
  comprehensive investigation in accordance with NJDEP site remediation regulations to determine the source and extent of the tritium in the groundwater. Power is conducting remedial actions to address
  the contamination in accordance with a remedial action workplan approved by the NJDEP in November 2004. The remedial actions are expected to be ongoing for several years. The costs necessary to
  address this on-site groundwater contamination issue are not expected to be material.

Low Level Radioactive Waste (LLRW)

As a by-product of their operations, nuclear generation units produce LLRW. Such wastes include paper, plastics, protective clothing, water purification materials and other materials. LLRW materials
  are accumulated on-site and disposed of at licensed permanent disposal facilities. New Jersey, Connecticut and South Carolina have formed the Atlantic Compact, which gives New Jersey nuclear
  generators, including Power, continued access to the Barnwell LLRW disposal facility which is owned by South Carolina. Power believes that the Atlantic Compact will provide for adequate LLRW disposal
  for Salem and Hope Creek through the end of their current licenses, although no assurances can be given. Both Power and Exelon have on-site LLRW storage facilities for Salem, Hope Creek and Peach
  Bottom, which have the capacity for at least five years of temporary storage for each facility. For information regarding Nuclear Spent Fuel Pool, see Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of
  the Notes.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

The following factors should be considered when reviewing the businesses of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings. These factors could significantly impact the businesses and cause results to
  differ materially from those expressed in any statements made by, or on behalf of PSEG, PSE&G, Power or Energy Holdings herein. Some or all of these factors may apply to each of PSEG, PSE&G, Power,
  Energy Holdings and their respective subsidiaries.

Generation operating performance may fall below projected levels

Power and Energy Holdings

Operating generating stations below expected capacity levels, especially at low-cost nuclear and coal facilities, may result in lost revenues and increased expenses, including replacement power costs.
  Factors that could cause generating station operations to fall below expected levels include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

breakdown or failure of equipment, processes or management effectiveness;

•

disruptions in the transmission of electricity;


•

labor disputes;

•

fuel supply interruptions or transportation constraints;

•

limitations which may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;

•

permit limitations; and

•

operator error or catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, acts of terrorism or other similar occurrences.

The potential lost revenues and increased expenses could result in a case where sufficient cash may not be available to service debt. In addition, any prolonged operating performance issues could
  potentially result in an impairment of the value of the affected facility.

Failure to obtain adequate and timely rate relief could negatively impact results

PSE&G

As a public utility, PSE&G’s rates are regulated. These rates are designed to allow PSE&G the opportunity to recover its operating expenses and earn a fair return on its rate base, which primarily consists
  of its property, plant and equipment. These rates include its electric and gas tariff rates that are subject to regulation by the BPU as well as its transmission rates that are subject to regulation by FERC.
  PSE&G’s base rates are set by the BPU for electric distribution and gas distribution and are effective until the time a new rate case is brought to the BPU. These base rate cases generally take place when
  equity returns fall below reasonable levels. Some categories of costs, such as energy costs, are recovered through adjustment charges that are periodically reset to reflect actual costs. If these costs exceed the
  amount included in PSE&G’s adjustment charges, there may be a negative impact on cash flows.

If PSE&G does not obtain adequate rate treatment on a timely basis in order to meet its operating expenses, there may be a negative impact on earnings and operating cash flows. PSE&G can give no
  assurances that tariff relief will be timely or sufficient for it to recover its costs and provide a sufficient return for its investors.

Energy Holdings

Global’s distribution facilities are rate-regulated enterprises. Governmental authorities establish rates charged to customers. While these rates are designed to cover all operating costs and provide a
  return on investment, Energy Holdings can give no assurances that rates will, in the future, be sufficient to cover Global’s costs and provide a sufficient return on its investments. In addition, future rates
  may not be adequate to provide cash flow to pay principal and interest on the debt of Global’s subsidiaries and affiliates or to enable its subsidiaries and affiliates to comply with the terms of debt
  agreements.

Inability to balance energy obligations, available supply and trading risks could negatively impact results

Power and Energy Holdings

The revenues generated by the operation of the generating stations are subject to market risks that are beyond each company’s control. Generation output will either be used to satisfy wholesale
  contract requirements, other bilateral contracts or be sold into other competitive power markets. Participants in the competitive power markets are not guaranteed any specified rate of return on their
  capital investments through recovery of mandated rates payable by purchasers of electricity.

Generation revenues and results of operations are dependent upon prevailing market prices for energy, capacity, ancillary services and fuel supply in the markets served.

Power

Power’s energy trading and marketing activities frequently involve the establishment of forward sale positions in the wholesale energy markets on long-term and short-term bases. To the extent that
  Power has produced or purchased energy in excess of its contracted obligations a reduction in market prices could reduce profitability.


Conversely, to the extent that Power has contracted obligations in excess of energy it has produced or purchased, an increase in market prices could reduce profitability.

If the strategy Power utilizes to hedge its exposures to these various risks is not effective, it could incur significant losses. Power’s substantial market positions can also be adversely affected by the level
  of volatility in the energy markets that, in turn, depends on various factors, including weather in various geographical areas, short-term supply and demand imbalances and pricing differentials at various
  geographic locations, which cannot be predicted with any certainty.

Increases in market prices also affect Power’s ability to hedge generation output and fuel requirements as the obligation to post margin increases with increasing prices and, resultingly, could require the
  maintenance of liquidity resources that would be prohibitively expensive.

Environmental regulations could limit operations

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are required to comply with numerous statutes, regulations and ordinances relating to the safety and health of employees and the public, the protection of
  the environment and land use. These statutes, regulations and ordinances are constantly changing. While management believes that PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings have obtained all material
  approvals currently required to own and operate their respective facilities and that approvals will be issued in a timely manner, significant additional costs could be incurred in order to comply with these
  requirements. In some cases, the cost of compliance could exceed the marginal value of the facility. Failure to comply with environmental statutes, regulations and ordinances could have a material effect on
  PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, including potential civil or criminal liability, the imposition of clean-up liens or fines and expenditures of funds to bring facilities into compliance or possible
  impairment of the value of the affected facility.

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings can give no assurance that they will be able to:

•

obtain all required environmental approvals not yet received or that may be required in the future;

•

obtain any necessary modifications to existing environmental approvals;

•

maintain compliance with all applicable environmental laws, regulations and approvals; or

•

recover any resulting costs through future sales.

Delay in obtaining or failure to obtain and maintain in full force and effect any environmental approvals, or delay or failure to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements, could
  prevent construction of new facilities, operation of existing facilities or sale of energy from these facilities or could result in significant additional costs.

Power

Many of Power’s generating facilities are located in the State of New Jersey where environmental programs are generally considered to be more stringent in comparison to similar programs in other
  states. As such, there may be instances where the facilities located in New Jersey are subject to more stringent and, therefore, more costly pollution control requirements than competitive facilities in other
  states.

Regulatory issues significantly impact operations and profitability

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

Federal, state and local authorities impose substantial regulation and permitting requirements on the electric power generation business. Power and Energy Holdings are required to comply with
  numerous laws and regulations and to obtain numerous governmental permits in order to operate generation stations. In addition, PSE&G’s and certain of Global’s distribution facilities could be subject to
  financial penalties if reliability performance standards are not met.

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings can give no assurance that existing regulations will not be revised or reinterpreted, that new laws and regulations will not be adopted or become applicable or
  that future changes in laws and regulations, including the possibility of reregulation in some deregulated markets, will not have a detrimental effect on their respective businesses.


Power and Energy Holdings

Power and Energy Holdings believe that they have obtained all material energy-related federal, state and local approvals currently required to operate their respective generation stations and sell
  energy output, including MBR authority from FERC. Although not currently required, additional regulatory approvals may be required in the future due to changes in laws and regulations or for other
  reasons. No assurance can be given that Power and Energy Holdings will be able to obtain any required regulatory approval in the future, or that they will be able to obtain any necessary extensions in
  receiving any required regulatory approvals.

Power is also subject to pervasive regulation by the NRC with respect to the operation of nuclear generation stations. This regulation involves testing, evaluation and modification of all aspects of plant
  operation in light of NRC safety, environmental and personnel management requirements. The NRC also requires continuous demonstrations that plant operations meet applicable requirements. The NRC
  has the ultimate authority to determine whether any nuclear generation unit may operate.

Any failure to obtain or comply with any required regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect Power’s and Energy Holdings’ ability to operate generation stations or sell electricity to third
  parties.

In addition, there is also a risk to Power and Energy Holdings if states decide to turn away from competition and allow regulated utilities to continue to own or reacquire and operate generating stations
  in a regulated and potentially uneconomical manner, or to encourage rate-based treatment for the construction of new base-load generating units. This has already occurred in certain states. The lack of
  consistent rules in markets outside of PJM can negatively impact the competitiveness of Power’s plants.

Moreover, current rules being developed at FERC, at DOE and at PJM with respect to the access to and construction of transmission and the allocation of costs for such construction may have the
  effect of altering the level playing field between transmission options and generation options, which could have a competitive impact upon PSEG and Power.

Availability of adequate power transmission facilities

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

The ability to sell and deliver electric energy products may be adversely impacted and the ability to generate revenues may be limited if:

•

transmission is disrupted;

•

transmission capacity is inadequate; or

•

a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate.

Inability to access sufficient capital in the amounts and at the times needed

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

Capital for projects and investments has been provided by internally-generated cash flow, equity issuances by PSEG and borrowings by PSEG, PSE&G, Power, Energy Holdings and their respective
  subsidiaries. Continued access to debt capital from outside sources is required in order to efficiently fund the cash flow needs of the businesses. The ability to arrange financing and the costs of capital
  depend on numerous factors including, among other things, general economic and market conditions, the availability of credit from banks and other financial institutions, investor confidence, the success of
  current projects and the quality of new projects.

The ability to access sufficient capital in the bank and debt capital markets is dependent upon current and future capital structure, performance, financial condition and the availability of capital at a
  reasonable economic cost. As a result, no assurance can be given that PSEG, PSE&G, Power or Energy Holdings will be successful in obtaining financing for projects and investments or funding the equity
  commitments required for such projects and investments in the future.

Counterparty credit risks or a deterioration of credit quality

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

As market prices for energy and fuel fluctuate, Power’s forward energy sale and forward fuel purchase contracts could require substantial collateral requiring Power to source additional liquidity during
  periods when Power’s ability to source such liquidity may be limited. Also, in connection with its energy trading


activities, Power must meet credit quality standards required by counterparties. Standard industry contracts generally require trading counterparties to maintain investment grade ratings. These same
  contracts provide reciprocal benefits to Power. If Power loses its investment grade credit rating, ER&T would have to provide additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which would
  significantly impact the energy trading business. This would increase Power’s costs of doing business and limit its ability to successfully conduct energy trading operations.

Power sells generation output through the execution of bilateral contracts. These contracts are subject to credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual obligations.
  Any failure to perform on the part of these counterparties could have a material impact on PSEG’s and Power’s results of operations, cash flows and financial position. As market prices rise above
  contracted price levels, Power is required to post collateral with purchasers. Collateral posting requirements for BGS contracts in particular are one-sided. If market prices fall below BGS contracted price
  levels for a single contract, power purchasers are not required to post collateral with Power. However, such margin positions can be netted against margin due from Power in other BGS contracts with the
  same counterparty.

Substantial competition from well-capitalized participants in the worldwide energy markets

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

Restructuring of worldwide energy markets is creating opportunities for, and substantial competition from, well-capitalized entities that may adversely affect the ability of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and
  Energy Holdings to make investments on favorable terms and achieve growth objectives. Increased competition could contribute to a reduction in prices offered for power and could result in lower returns
  which may affect PSEG’s, PSE&G’s, Power’s and Energy Holdings’ ability to service their respective outstanding indebtedness, including short-term debt. Some of the competitors include:

•

merchant generators;

•

banks, funds and other financial entities;

•

domestic and multi-national utility generators;

•

energy marketers;

•

fuel supply companies; and

•

affiliates of other industrial companies.

As a holding company, the ability to service debt could be limited

PSEG and Energy Holdings

PSEG and Energy Holdings are holding companies with no material assets other than the stock or membership interests of their subsidiaries and project affiliates. As such, PSEG and Energy Holdings
  depend on their respective subsidiaries’ and project affiliates’ cash flow and their respective access to capital in order to service their indebtedness. Each of PSEG’s and Energy Holdings’ respective
  subsidiaries and project affiliates are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts when due on PSEG’s or Energy Holdings’ debt or to make any
  funds available to pay such amounts. As a result, PSEG’s and Energy Holdings’ debt will effectively be subordinated to all existing and future debt, trade creditors, and other liabilities of their respective
  subsidiaries and project affiliates and PSEG’s and Energy Holdings’ rights and hence the rights of their respective creditors to participate in any distribution of assets of any subsidiary or project affiliate
  upon its liquidation or reorganization or otherwise would be subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s or project affiliate’s creditors, except to the extent that PSEG’s or Energy Holdings’ claims as a
  creditor of such subsidiary or project affiliate may be recognized.

In addition, Energy Holdings’ subsidiaries’ project-related debt agreements generally restrict the subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, make cash distributions or otherwise transfer funds. These
  restrictions may include achieving and maintaining financial performance or debt coverage ratios, absence of events of default, or priority in payment of other current or prospective obligations. Also,
  Energy Holdings is structurally designed to be able to meet its obligations without any support from its parent, PSEG. These restrictions could further restrict Energy Holdings’ ability to service its
  outstanding indebtedness.


Adverse international developments could negatively impact results

Energy Holdings

A component of PSEG’s and Energy Holdings business is international distribution and generation, primarily in Chile and Peru. The economic and political conditions in certain countries where Global
  has interests present risks that may be different than those found in the U.S. which could affect the value of its investments, cash flows from projects and make it more difficult to obtain non-recourse
  project refinancing on suitable terms or could impair Global’s ability to enforce its rights under agreements relating to such projects. Such risks include:

•

expropriation or nationalization of energy assets;

•

renegotiation or abrogation of existing contracts; and

•

changes in law or tax policy.

Operations in foreign countries also present risks associated with currency exchange rates and convertibility, inflation and repatriation of earnings. In some countries, economic and monetary conditions
  and other factors could affect Global’s ability to convert its cash distributions to U.S. Dollars or other freely convertible currencies, or to move funds offshore from these countries. Furthermore, the central
  bank of any of these countries may have the authority to suspend, restrict or otherwise impose conditions on foreign exchange transactions or to approve distributions to foreign investors.

Inability to realize tax benefits

Energy Holdings

Through its leveraged lease investments, Resources acquired an asset by investing equity representing approximately 15% to 20% of the cost of the asset and incurring non-recourse lease debt for the
  balance. As the owner, Resources is entitled to depreciate the asset under applicable federal and state tax guidelines and receives income from the tax benefits associated with interest and depreciation
  deductions with respect to the leased property. The ability of Resources to realize these tax benefits is dependent on operating income generated by its affiliates and allocated pursuant to PSEG’s
  consolidated tax sharing agreement. A reduction of operating income could impair Resources’ ability to receive such benefits, which would result in a reduction of earnings and cash flows. In addition,
  during 2006, the IRS disallowed certain deductions associated with some of the leveraged leases which have been designated by the IRS as listed transactions. For additional information see Note 12.
  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes. Any material disallowance of deductions could impact Energy Holdings’ earnings and ability to service its outstanding indebtedness.

Decreases in the value of the pension and other postretirement assets could require additional funding

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

Adverse changes in the rates of return or performance of the investments in which the pension and other postretirement trust assets are held could lower the value of the funds and the trust assets. Such
  a decline in value could result in additional funding obligations to meet the applicable legal and regulatory requirements. To the extent that these additional funding obligations are significant, this could
  impact PSEG’s, PSE&G’s, Power’s and Energy Holdings’ ability to service debt.

Changes in technology may make power generation assets less competitive

Power and Energy Holdings

A key element of the business plan is that generating power at central power plants produces electricity at relatively low cost. There are alternative technologies to produce electricity that continue to
  attract capital for research and development, most notably fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic (solar) cells. It is possible that advances in technology will reduce the cost of alternative
  methods of producing electricity to a level that is competitive with that of most central station electric production. If this were to happen, Power’s and Energy Holdings’ market share could be eroded and
  the value of their respective power plants could be significantly impaired. Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity, which could affect
  financial results.


Insurance coverages may not be sufficient

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings have insurance for their respective facilities, including:

•

all-risk property damage insurance;

•

commercial general public liability insurance;

•

boiler and machinery coverage;

•

nuclear liability; and

•

for nuclear generating units, replacement power and business interruption insurance in amounts and with deductibles that management considers appropriate.

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings can give no assurance that this insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms or that the insurance proceeds received
  for any loss of or any damage to any of their respective facilities will be sufficient to fund future payments on debt. Additionally, some properties may not be insured in the event of an act of terrorism.

Recession, acts of war or terrorism

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

The consequences of a prolonged recession and adverse market conditions may include the continued uncertainty of energy prices and the capital and commodity markets. Management cannot predict
  the impact of any continued economic slowdown, reduced growth rate in energy usage or fluctuating energy prices; however, such impact could have a material adverse effect on PSEG’s, PSE&G’s, Power’s
  and Energy Holdings’ financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

Major industrial facilities, generation plants, fuel storage facilities and transmission and distribution facilities may be targets of terrorist activities that could result in disruption of PSE&G’s, Power’s or
  Energy Holdings’ ability to produce or distribute some portion of their respective energy products. Any such disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues and/or significant additional costs to
  repair, which could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition, results of operation and net cash flows of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings.

Power rents office space from Services as its headquarters in Newark, New Jersey. Other leased properties include office, warehouse, classroom and storage space, primarily located in New Jersey.
  Power also owns the Central Maintenance Shop at Sewaren, New Jersey.

Power has a 57.41% ownership interest in approximately 13,000 acres in the Delaware River Estuary region to satisfy the condition of the NJPDES permit issued for Salem. Power also owns several
  other facilities, including the on-site Nuclear Administration and Processing Center buildings.

Power has a 13.91% ownership interest in the 650-acre Merrill Creek Reservoir in Warren County, New Jersey and approximately 2,158 acres of land surrounding the reservoir. The reservoir was
  constructed to store water for release to the Delaware River during periods of low flow. Merrill Creek is jointly-owned by seven companies that have generation facilities along the Delaware River or its
  tributaries and use the river water in their operations.

Power believes that it maintains adequate insurance coverage against loss or damage to its plants and properties, subject to certain exceptions, to the extent such property is usually insured and
  insurance is available at a reasonable cost. For a discussion of nuclear insurance, see Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes.

On December 22, 2006, Global entered into an agreement to sell its 34.5% interest in Thermal Energy Development Partnership, L.P. which owns the 21 MW biomass-fueled Tracy project in California
      and therefore, has been excluded. The sale closed in January 2007. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments of the Notes.


Domestic Generation

TIE

Global owns 100% of TIE which owns and operates two electric generation facilities, one in Guadalupe County in south central Texas (Guadalupe) and one in Odessa in western Texas (Odessa).
  Approximately 30% of the total expected output of TIE for 2007 has been sold via bilateral agreements and additional bilateral sales for peak and off-peak services will be signed as the year progresses.
  Any remaining uncommitted output is sold in the Texas spot market. Included in the amounts above is a 350 MW daily capacity call option at Odessa that expires on December 31, 2010.

Kalaeloa

Global’s 50% partner in Kalaeloa is a power fund managed by Harbert Power Corporation (Harbert). All of the electricity generated by the Kalaeloa power plant is sold to the Hawaiian Electric
  Company, Inc. (HECO) under a PPA expiring in May 2016. Under a steam purchase and sale agreement expiring in May 2016, the Kalaeloa power plant supplies steam to the adjacent Tesoro refinery. The
  primary fuel, low sulfur fuel oil, is provided from the adjacent Tesoro refinery under a long-term all requirements contract. The refinery is interconnected to the power plant by a pipeline and preconditions
  the fuel oil prior to delivery. Back-up fuel supply is provided by HECO.

The two combustion turbines of Kalaeloa were upgraded in 2004 resulting in both an increase in the net plant output by approximately 20 MW and an improvement in the efficiency of consuming fuel.
  As a result of the upgrades, Kalaeloa and HECO entered into two amendments to the PPA. The amendments were effective upon final approval from the Public Utility Commission of the State of Hawaii
  in September 2005. The amendments increased Kalaeloa’s firm capacity and associated energy sales to HECO from 180 MW to 208 MW.

GWF and Hanford

Global and an affiliate of Harbert each own 50% of GWF. PPAs for the five GWF Bay Area plants’ net output are in place with Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) ending in 2020 and 2021.
  GWF acquires the petroleum coke used to fuel its plants through contracts with three local oil refineries with minimum volumes nominated by GWF annually and price negotiated between the parties either
  semi-annually or annually. Three of the five GWF plants have been modified to burn a wider variety of petroleum coke products to mitigate fuel supply and pricing risk.

Global and an affiliate of Harbert each own 50% of Hanford. A PPA for the plant’s net output is in place with PG&E ending in August 2011. Hanford acquires the petroleum coke fired in its plant
  through a contract with a refinery with price negotiated semi-annually.

Hanford, Henrietta and Tracy Peaker Plants

GWF Energy, which is 60% owned by Global and 40% owned by a power fund managed by Harbert, owns and operates three peaker plants in California. Global owned approximately 75% of GWF
  Energy until February 2004 when it sold a 14.9% interest to Harbinger for approximately $14 million. The output of these plants is sold under a PPA with the California Department of Water Resources
  (DWR) with maturities in 2011 and 2012. DWR has the right to schedule energy and/or reserve capacity from each unit of the three plants for a maximum of 2,000 hours each year. Energy and capacity not
  scheduled by DWR is available for sale by GWF Energy. DWR supplies the natural gas when the units are scheduled for dispatch by DWR. GWF Energy obtains the natural gas used to fuel its plants for
  non-DWR sales from the spot market on a non-firm basis.

International Generation

India

PPN

Global owns a 20% interest in PPN located in Tamil Nadu, India. Global’s partners include the Apollo Infrastructure Company Ltd., with a 46.9% interest, Marubeni Corporation, with a 26% interest,
  Housing


Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and HDFC Life Insurance Corporation, with a 5% and 2.1% interest respectively. PPN has entered into a PPA for the sale of 100% of its output to the State
  Electricity Board of Tamil Nadu (TNEB) for 30 years, with an agreement to take-or-pay equal to a plant load factor of at least 68.5%.

Italy

Prisma

Global owns an 85% interest in Prisma which indirectly owns and operates three biomass generation plants in Italy through its ownership of 100% of San Marco Bioenergie S.p.A., which owns a 20
  MW plant, and 50% of Biomasse, a partnership with Api Holding S.p.A., which owns two plants totaling 60 MW. Global records Prisma’s investment in Biomasse as an equity method investment due to
  Global’s approximate 43% indirect ownership in Biomasse. The output of the plants is sold under power purchase agreements with the Italian national grid (CIP contracts), which include a premium for the
  renewable energy output. These contracts expire from 2009 through 2012. For additional information relating to Prisma, see Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes.

Peru

Electroandes

Global owns a 100% interest in Electroandes located in Peru. Electroandes’ main assets include four hydroelectric facilities with a combined installed capacity of 180 MW and 437 miles of transmission
  lines located in the central Andean region east of Lima. Electroandes’ revenues were obtained through various PPAs, denominated in U.S. Dollars. Electroandes has contracted for 95% and 91% in 2007
  and 2008, respectively, and over 50% for 2009 and 2010. Approximately 75% of the PPAs in 2007 are with unregulated customers with a more balanced split between regulated and unregulated in 2008 and
  beyond.

Venezuela

Turboven

The facilities in Maracay and Cagua are owned and operated by Turboven, an entity which is jointly-owned by Global (50%) and Corporacion Industrial de Energia (CIE). PPAs expiring between 2007
  and 2011 have been entered into for the sale of approximately 40% of the output of Maracay and Cagua to various industrial customers. The PPAs are structured to provide energy only with minimum take
  provisions. Fuel costs are passed through directly to customers and the energy tariffs are calculated in U.S. Dollars and paid in local currency. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions,
  Acquisitions and Impairments of the Notes for a discussion of recent events in Venezuela.

TGM

Global has a 9% indirect interest in TGM through a partnership with CIE. TGM sells all of the energy produced under a PPA with Manufacturas del Papel (MANPA), a paper manufacturing concern
  located in Maracay. MANPA and CIE have common controlling shareholders. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments of the Notes for a discussion of recent
  events in Venezuela.

SAESA Group

Global owns a 99.99% equity interest in SAESA, 98.99% of Empresa Electrica de la Frontera S.A. (Frontel) and 100% of PSEG Generacion y Energia Chile Limitada (Generacion), collectively known
  as the SAESA Group. The SAESA Group consists of four distribution companies and one transmission company that provide electric service to 390 cities and towns over 900 miles in southern Chile and a
  generating company. The SAESA Group has 120 MW of installed generating capacity in operation (46 MW of natural gas-fired peaker capacity, 51 MW oil-fired, 21 MW hydro and 2 MW wind). The
  transmission company, Sistema de Transmision del Sur S.A. (STS), provides transmission services to electric generation facilities that have PPAs with distributors in Regions VIII, IX and X and has installed
  transformation capacity of 918 megavolt-amperes.

The SAESA Group also owned a 50% interest in an Argentine distribution company, Empresa de Energia Rio Negro S.A., which provides generation, transmission and distribution services to
  approximately 147,000 customers in the Province of Rio Negro, Argentina, but was sold in the last quarter of 2006. The management of the SAESA Group is organized and administered according to a
  centralized administrative structure designed to maximize operational synergies. For additional information related to the SAESA Group, see Item 1. Business—Regulatory Issues.

Chilquinta and LDS

Global and Sempra Energy (Sempra), each own 50% of the shares of Chilquinta, an energy distribution company with numerous energy holdings, based in Valparaiso, Chile. Following the sale in 2004
  of 12% of the shares of LDS to the public, Global and Sempra own 75.9% of LDS, an electric distribution company located in Lima, Peru. As part of the Chilquinta and LDS investments, Global and
  Sempra also own Tecnored and Tecsur, located in Chile and Peru, respectively. These companies provide procurement and contracting services to Chilquinta, LDS and others.

As equal partners, Global and Sempra share in the management of Chilquinta and LDS. However, Sempra has assumed lead operational responsibilities at Chilquinta, while Global has assumed lead
  operational responsibilities at LDS. The shareholders’ agreement provides for important veto rights over major partnership decisions including dividend policy, budget approvals, management appointments
  and indebtedness.

Chilquinta operates under a non-exclusive perpetual franchise within Chile’s Region V which is located just north and west of Santiago. Global believes that direct competition for distribution
  customers would be uneconomical for potential competitors. LDS operates under an exclusive, perpetual franchise in the southern portion of the city of Lima and in an area just south of the city along the
  coast serving a population of approximately 3.2 million. Both Chilquinta and LDS purchase energy for distribution from generators in their respective markets on a contract basis. For additional information
  related to Chilquinta and LDS, see Item 1. Business—Regulatory Issues.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

PSE&G

In November 2001, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison) filed a complaint against PSE&G, PJM and NYISO with FERC asserting a failure to comply with agreements between
  PSE&G and Con Edison covering 1,000 MW of transmission. PSE&G denied the allegations set forth in the complaint. An Initial Decision issued by an ALJ in April 2002 upheld PSE&G’s claim in part but also
  accepted Con Edison’s contentions in part. In December 2002, FERC issued an order modifying the Initial Decision and remanding a number of issues to the ALJ for additional hearings, including issues
  related to the development of protocols to implement the findings of the order and regarding Phase II of the complaint. The ALJ issued an Initial Decision on the Phase II issues in June 2003 and in August
  2004, FERC issued its decision on Phase II issues. While those decisions were largely favorable to PSE&G, PSE&G sought rehearing as to certain issues, as did Con Edison. Those rehearing applications are
  currently pending.

The August 2004 order required that PJM, NYISO, Con Edison and PSE&G meet for the purpose of developing operational protocols to implement FERC’s directives. On February 18, 2005, NYISO,
  PJM and


PSE&G submitted a joint compliance filing pursuant to FERC’s August 2004 decision. FERC approved the joint proposals on May 18, 2005 and they took effect on July 1, 2005. In subsequent filings to FERC
  regarding the efficacy of these protocols, Con Edison continues to claim that the obligations under the agreements as interpreted by the FERC’s orders are not being met. In December 30, 2005 and January
  19, 2007 filings with FERC, Con Edison claims to have incurred $111 million in damages, and has requested FERC to require refunds of this amount. To the extent that this claim is directed at PSE&G,
  PSE&G believes that the claim has no legal basis and that, in any event, PSE&G has meritorious defenses to the claim. PJM, NYISO, Con Edison and PSE&G have agreed to a work plan under which they will
  attempt, during the Spring of 2007, to address operational issues associated with the protocols and to address Con Edison’s refund claim. Con Edison has also requested that, if these settlement discussions
  are not successful, that FERC convene judge-mediated settlement discussions, to be followed by hearings if necessary. The scope of the discussions envisioned under the work plan are not currently
  expected, however, to encompass a comprehensive review of all matters raised in the November 2001 complaint or the pending rehearing requests of the FERC’s orders. As this matter is currently pending
  before FERC, PSEG and PSE&G are unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding.

Energy Holdings

India

Global has a 20% ownership interest in PPN, which sells its output under a long-term PPA with the TNEB. TNEB has not made full payment to PPN for the purchase of energy under the PPA.
  Resolution of the past due receivables against which PPN has established reserves was expected to be achieved in 2005 by a joint working group including the Central Electric Authority (CEA), PPN and
  TNEB. However, in the latter part of 2005, the CEA reportedly stated that it had no jurisdiction in the matter and referred the parties to the Tamil Nadu Electric Regulatory Commission (TNERC).
  Neither PPN nor Global believe that TNERC has jurisdiction over Capital Cost Approval, a significant component of the receivables reserve. An adverse outcome concerning the disputed Capital Cost
  Approvals could result in impairment of this investment.

On March 26, 2004, Global and El Paso Energy Corporation (which sold its ownership interest in PPN in 2005) filed a notice of arbitration on behalf of PPN against TNEB under the arbitration clause
  of the PPA, asserting that they have the right as minority shareholders to protect the contractual rights of PPN where PPN has failed to exercise those rights itself. In response, PPN filed a petition for an
  anti-suit injunction against the arbitration. Global successfully defended against the petition in two lower courts. PPN has filed its final appeal in the Supreme Court of India (SLP Civil No. 23169). Hearings
  that began on January 24, 2005 have resulted in a stay of PSEG’s continued actions in the arbitral court pending a decision by the Indian Supreme Court, which is expected in due course.

On December 30, 2006, Global petitioned the Company Law Board (Law Board) in Chennai, India to withdraw, without prejudice, its case against certain other members of PPN’s Board of Directors,
  PPN management and certain other PPN shareholders for failure to act in PPN’s best interest and other assertions. The Law Board issued the order as requested and the other parties did not object. The
  withdrawal of the Law Board case is expected to result in an eventual dismissal of the injunction against the arbitration described above.

As of December 31, 2006, Global’s total investment in PPN was approximately $34 million.

Turkey

From about 1995 through 2001, Global and its partners expended approximately $12 million towards the construction of a power plant in the Konya-Ilgin region of Turkey. In 2001, Turkey passed
  legislation and otherwise deprived Global of rights and fair and equitable treatment and expropriated Global’s Concession contract for the power plant project without compensation, despite the Turkish
  Government’s obligation to compensate Global for its costs under the existing contract and Turkish law. In 2002, Global initiated arbitration before the International Centre for Settlement of International
  Disputes seeking return of sunk costs, lost profits, interest and attorney fees and costs. A decision in this matter was made in January 2007 under which the Turkish Government will be required to pay
  Global and its partners approximately $20 million for sunk costs, interest and arbitration fees. After legal contingency fees, Global expects to receive approximately $7 million, after tax, for its share of the
  project. Global expects to receive payment in the second quarter of 2007.

PSE&G and Power

In addition, see the following environmental related matters involving governmental authorities. PSE&G and Power do not expect expenditures for any such site relating to the items listed below,
  individually or for all such current sites in the aggregate, to have a material effect on their respective financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

(1) Claim made in 1985 by the U.S. Department of the Interior under CERCLA with respect to the Pennsylvania Avenue and Fountain Avenue municipal landfills in Brooklyn, New York, for damages
  to


natural resources. The U.S. Government alleges damages of approximately $200 million. To PSE&G’s knowledge there has been no action on this matter since 1988.

(2) Duane Marine Salvage Corporation Superfund Site is in Perth Amboy, Middlesex County, New Jersey. The EPA had named PSE&G as one of several potentially responsible parties (PRPs) through
  a series of administrative orders between December 1984 and March 1985. Following work performed by the PRPs, the EPA declared on May 20, 1987 that all of its administrative orders had been satisfied.
  The NJDEP, however, named PSE&G as a PRP and issued its own directive dated October 21, 1987. Remediation is currently ongoing.

(3) Various Spill Act directives were issued by NJDEP to PRPs, including PSE&G with respect to the PJP Landfill in Jersey City, Hudson County, New Jersey, ordering payment of costs associated with
  operation and maintenance, interim remedial measures and a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) in excess of $25 million. The directives also sought reimbursement of NJDEP’s past and
  future oversight costs and the costs of any future remedial action.

(4) Claim by the EPA, Region III, under CERCLA with respect to a Cottman Avenue Superfund Site, a former non-ferrous scrap reclamation facility located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned and
  formerly operated by Metal Bank of America, Inc. PSE&G, other utilities and other companies are alleged to be liable for contamination at the site and PSE&G has been named as a PRP. A Final Remedial
  Design Report was submitted to the EPA in September of 2002. This document presents the design details that will implement the EPA’s selected remediation remedy. The costs of remedy implementation
  are estimated to range from $14 million to $24 million. PSE&G’s share of the remedy implementation costs are estimated between $4 million and $8 million.

(5) The Klockner Road site is located in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey, and occupies approximately two acres on PSE&G’s Trenton Switching Station property. PSE&G entered into a
  memorandum of agreement with the NJDEP for the Klockner Road site pursuant to which PSE&G conducted an RI/FS and remedial action at the site to address the presence of soil and groundwater
  contamination at the site.

(6) The NJDEP assumed control of a former petroleum products blending and mixing operation and waste oil recycling facility in Elizabeth, Union County, New Jersey (Borne Chemical Co. site) and
  issued various directives to a number of entities, including PSE&G, requiring performance of various remedial actions. PSE&G’s nexus to the site is based upon the shipment of certain waste oils to the site for
  recycling. PSE&G and certain of the other entities named in NJDEP directives are members of a PRP group that have been working together to satisfy NJDEP requirements including: funding of the site
  security program; containerized waste removal; and a site remedial investigation program.

(7) The EPA sent PSE&G, Power and approximately 157 other entities a notice that the EPA considered each of the entities to be a potentially responsible party (PRP) with respect to contamination in
  Berry’s Creek in Bergen County, New Jersey and requesting that the PRPs perform a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) on Berry’s Creek and the connected tributaries and wetlands. Berry’s
  Creek flows through approximately 6.5 miles of areas that have been used for a variety of industrial purposes and landfills. The EPA estimates that the study could be completed in approximately five years
  at a total cost of approximately $18 million. PSE&G and Power are unable to predict the outcome of this matter; however, the related costs of this study are not expected to be material.

(8) The EPA sent PSE&G and three other entities a notice that the EPA considered each of the entities to be a PRP with respect to contamination in the Newark Bay Study Area, which it defined as
  Newark Bay and portions of the Hackensack River, the Arthur Kill, and the Kill Van Kull. The notice letter requested that PSE&G participate and fund the EPA-approved study in the Newark Bay Study
  Area and encouraged PSE&G to contact Occidental Chemical Corporation (OCC) to discuss participating in the RI/FS that OCC is conducting in the Newark Bay Study Area. EPA considers the Newark
  Bay Study Area, along with the Passaic River Study Area, to be part of the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site. The notice states EPA’s belief that hazardous substances were released from sites owned by
  PSE&G and located on the Hackensack River. The sites included two operating electric generating stations (Hudson and Kearny Sites), and one former MGP. PSE&G’s costs to clean up former MGPs are
  recoverable from utility customers through the SBC. The Hudson and Kearny Sites were transferred to Power in August 2000. Power assumed any environmental liabilities of PSE&G associated with the
  electric generating stations that PSE&G transferred to it, including the Hudson and Kearny Sites. Power has provided notice to insurers concerning this potential claim. PSE&G and Power are unable to
  estimate the cost of the investigation at this time.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)

This combined MD&A is separately filed by Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG), Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G), PSEG Power LLC (Power) and PSEG Energy
  Holdings L.L.C. (Energy Holdings). Information contained herein relating to any individual company is filed by such company on its own behalf. PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings each make
  representations only as to itself and make no other representations whatsoever as to any other company.

OVERVIEW OF 2006 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

PSEG’s business consists of four reportable segments, which are PSE&G, Power and the two direct subsidiaries of Energy Holdings: PSEG Global L.L.C. (Global) and PSEG Resources L.L.C.
  (Resources). The following discussion relates to the markets in which PSEG’s subsidiaries compete, the corporate strategy for the conduct of PSEG’s businesses within these markets and significant events
  that have occurred during 2006 and expectations for 2007 for PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, as well as the key factors that will drive the future performance of these businesses.

Termination of Merger Agreement

On December 20, 2004, PSEG entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with Exelon Corporation (Exelon) providing for a merger of PSEG with and into Exelon (Merger).
  On September 14, 2006, PSEG received from Exelon a formal notice terminating the Merger under the provisions of the Merger Agreement.

PSE&G

PSE&G operates as an electric and gas public utility in New Jersey under cost-based regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) for its distribution operations and by the Federal
  Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for its electric transmission and wholesale sales operations.

Consequently, the earnings of PSE&G are largely determined by the regulation of its rates by those agencies. In February 2007, the BPU approved the results of New Jersey’s annual Basic Generation
  Service (BGS)-Fixed Price (FP) and BGS-Commercial and Industrial Energy Price (CIEP) auctions and PSE&G successfully secured contracts to provide the electricity requirements for the majority of its
  customers’ needs.

Overview of 2006

During 2006 PSE&G:

•

reached a settlement agreement in the Gas Base Rate Case with the BPU Staff, New Jersey Public Ratepayer Advocate (RPA) and other intervening parties which was approved by the BPU on
      November 9, 2006 and provides for an annual increase in gas revenues of $40 million, an adjustment to lower book depreciation expense for PSE&G by approximately $26 million annually and the
      amortization of accumulated cost of removal that will further reduce depreciation and amortization expense by $13 million annually for five years.

•

reached a settlement agreement in the Electric Distribution Financial Review with the BPU Staff, RPA and other intervening parties concerning the excess depreciation rate credit which was
      approved by the BPU on November 9, 2006 and authorizes a reduction in the credit to $22 million, resulting in additional revenue to PSE&G of approximately $47 million annually based on current
      sales volumes.

Future Outlook

PSE&G believes that the decisions in November 2006 for both gas and electric base rates positions it to earn reasonable returns on investment in the future. The full year impact of these decisions
  combined with an anticipated return to more normal weather conditions is expected to improve PSE&G’s margins for 2007 and beyond.


The risks to PSE&G’s business generally relate to the treatment of the various rate and other issues by the state and federal regulatory agencies, specifically the BPU and FERC. PSE&G’s success will
  depend, in part, on its ability to attain a reasonable rate of return, continue cost containment initiatives, maintain system reliability and safety levels and continued recovery, with an adequate return, of the
  regulatory assets it has deferred and the investments it plans to make in its electric and gas transmission and distribution system. Since PSE&G earns no margin on the commodity portion of its electric and
  gas sales through tariff agreements, there is no anticipated commodity price volatility for PSE&G.

Power

Power is an electric generation and wholesale energy marketing and trading company that is focused on a generation market in the Northeast and Mid Atlantic U.S. Power’s principal operating
  subsidiaries, PSEG Fossil LLC (Fossil), PSEG Nuclear LLC (Nuclear) and PSEG Energy Resources & Trade LLC (ER&T) are regulated by FERC. Through its subsidiaries, Power seeks to balance its
  generation production, fuel requirements and supply obligations through integrated energy marketing and trading, enhance its ability to produce low-cost energy through efficient nuclear and coal
  operations and pursue modest growth based on market conditions. Changes in the operation of Power’s generating facilities, fuel and capacity prices, expected contract prices, capacity factors or other
  assumptions could materially affect its ability to meet earnings targets and/or liquidity requirements. In addition to the electric generation business described above, Power’s revenues include gas supply
  sales under the Basic Gas Supply Service (BGSS) contract with PSE&G.

As a merchant generator, Power’s profit is derived from selling under contract or on the spot market a range of diverse products such as energy, capacity, emissions credits, congestion credits, and a
  series of energy-related products that the system operator uses to optimize the operation of the energy grid, known as ancillary services. Accordingly, the prices of commodities, such as electricity, gas, coal
  and emissions, as well as the availability of Power’s diverse fleet of generation units to produce these products, can have a material effect on Power’s profitability. In recent years, the prices at which
  transactions are entered into for future delivery of these products, as evidenced through the market for forward contracts at points such as PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM) West, have escalated
  considerably over historical prices. Broad market price increases such as these are expected to have a positive effect on Power’s results. Historically, Power’s nuclear and coal-fired facilities have produced
  over 50% and 25% of Power’s production, respectively. With the vast majority of its power sourced from lower-cost units, the rise in electric prices is anticipated to yield higher near-term margins for
  Power. Power anticipates recognizing these higher near-term margins, especially on the portion of its output that was more recently contracted or sold on the spot market. Over a longer-term horizon, if
  these higher prices are sustained at prices reflective of what the current forward markets indicate, it would yield an attractive environment for Power to contract the sale of its anticipated output, allowing
  for potentially sustained higher profitability than recognized in prior years. These escalated prices also increase the cost of replacement power, thereby placing incremental risk on the operations of the
  generating units to produce these products.

Power seeks to mitigate volatility in its results by contracting in advance for a significant portion of its anticipated electric output and fuel needs. Power believes this contracting strategy increases
  stability of earnings and cash flow. By keeping some portion of its output uncontracted, Power is able to retain some exposure to market changes as well as provide some protection in the event of
  unexpected generation outages.

Power seeks to sell a portion of its anticipated low-cost nuclear and coal-fired generation over a multi-year forward horizon, normally over a period of approximately two to four years. As of February
  14, 2007, Power has contracted for approximately 100% of its anticipated 2007 nuclear and coal-fired generation, with 90% to 100% contracted for 2008 and 35% to 50% contracted for 2009, with a modest
  amount contracted beyond 2009.

Power has also entered into contracts for the future delivery of nuclear fuel and coal to support its contracted sales discussed above. As of February 1, 2007, Power had contracted for 100% of its
  anticipated nuclear uranium fuel needs through 2011, and approximately 70% of its average anticipated coal needs, including transportation, through 2009. These estimates are subject to change based upon
  the level of operation, and in particular for coal, are subject to market demands and pricing.

By contrast, Power takes a more opportunistic approach in hedging its anticipated natural gas-fired generation. The generation from these units is less predictable, as these units are generally dispatched
  only


when aggregate market demand has exceeded the supply provided by lower-cost units. The natural gas-fired units generally provide a lower contribution to the margin of Power than either the nuclear or
  coal units. Power will generally purchase natural gas as gas-fired generation is required to supply forward sale commitments.

In a changing market environment, this hedging strategy may cause Power’s realized prices to be materially different than current market prices. At the present time, some of Power’s existing
  contractual obligations, entered into during lower-priced periods, are anticipated to result in lower margins than would have been the case if no or little hedging activity had been conducted. Alternatively,
  in a falling price environment, this hedging strategy will tend to create margins in excess of those implied by the then current market.

Overview of 2006

During 2006, FERC issued certain orders related to market design that have changed the nature of capacity payments in the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) and are scheduled to change the
  nature of payments in PJM. In PJM, the Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) will provide generators with differentiated capacity payments based upon the location of their respective facilities. Similarly, the
  Forward Capacity Market (FCM) settlement in NEPOOL provides for locational capacity payments. FERC has approved the market changes in each of these markets, with the anticipated start date for
  RPM set for June 1, 2007 and FCM transition period having begun on December 1, 2006. Power currently receives fixed Reliability-Must-Run (RMR) payments in PJM and NEPOOL for certain of its
  facilities which are provided to ensure the continued availability of those facilities.

Also during 2006 Power:

•

commenced commercial operations of its 1,186 MW, natural gas-fired combined cycle power generation plant in Linden, New Jersey;

•

reached an agreement with the EPA and NJDEP that will allow the continued operation of the Hudson facility and extends for four years the deadline for installing environmental controls beyond
      the previous December 31, 2006 deadline;

•

announced its plans to resume direct management of the Salem and Hope Creek facilities before the expiration of the Operating Service Contract with Exelon Generation and to have the senior
      management team at those facilities to become employees of Power effective January 1, 2007; and

•

entered into an agreement to sell its Lawrenceburg Energy Center, a 1,080 MW gas-fired combined cycle electric generating plant in Lawrenceburg, Indiana.

Future Outlook

Power expects margin improvements in 2007 as higher prices for its nuclear and coal output are realized due to the rolling nature of its forward hedge positions and the expiration of its contract in
  Connecticut. The sale of Lawrenceburg and anticipated improvements in margins on serving the BGSS contract are also expected to benefit future results.

In addition, Power believes that the redesign in capacity markets, discussed above, could lead to changes in the value of the majority of its generating capacity and result in incremental margin of $100
  million to $150 million in 2007, with higher increases in future years as the full year impact is realized and existing capacity contracts expire.

A key factor in Power’s ability to achieve its objectives is its capability to operate its nuclear and fossil stations at sufficient capacity factors to limit the need to purchase higher-priced electricity to
  satisfy its obligations. Power’s ability to achieve its objectives will also depend on the implementation of reasonable capacity markets. Power must also be able to effectively manage its construction projects
  and continue to economically operate its generation facilities under increasingly stringent environmental requirements. In addition, with an increase in competition and market complexity and constantly
  changing forward prices, there is no assurance that Power will be able to contract its output at attractive prices. While these increases may have a potentially significant beneficial impact on margins, they
  could also raise any replacement power costs that Power may incur in the event of unanticipated outages, and could also further increase liquidity requirements as a result of contract obligations. Power
  could also be impacted by the lack of consistent rules in markets outside of PJM, including rate-regulated utility ownership of generation and other regulatory


actions favoring non-competitive markets. For additional information on liquidity requirements, see Liquidity and Capital Resources.

Energy Holdings

Energy Holdings’ operations are principally conducted through its subsidiaries Global, which has invested in international, rate-regulated distribution companies and domestic and international
  generation companies, and Resources, which primarily invests in energy-related leveraged leases.

Global

Global has reduced its international risk by opportunistically monetizing investments that no longer had a strategic fit. During the past three years, Global has
  reduced its overall investments from $2.6 billion to $1.9 billion, driven by sales of over $1 billion of investments in China, Brazil, Poland, India, Africa and the Middle East. See Note 4. Discontinued
  Operations, Acquisitions, Dispositions and Impairments of the Notes, for a discussion of these sales. The decrease in Global’s portfolio size due to the above sales was partially offset by strong earnings from
  its Texas merchant generation business and its electric distribution companies in Chile and Peru. Approximately 65% of Global’s remaining investments are in Chile and Peru with another 27% in the
  United States. Other modest sized investments in Italy, India and Venezuela comprise the remaining 8% of Global’s portfolio.

As a result of the investment sales, approximately 50% of Global’s future earnings is expected to be derived from its domestic generation business, of which over half is from its 2,000 MW gas-fired combined
  cycle merchant generation business in Texas with the balance from its 12 fully contracted generating facilities in which Global’s ownership percentage equates to nearly 400 MW. The other 50% of Global’s
  earnings is expected to be essentially from three rate-regulated electric distribution businesses in Chile and Peru which serve approximately two million customers and a 183 MW hydro generation facility in Peru. The
  regulatory environment in both Chile and Peru has generally been constructive since Global acquired these investments.  Chile maintains an investment grade rating and Peru’s rating, although non-investment grade, has improved.

Energy Holdings continues to review Global’s portfolio, with a focus on its international investments. As part of this review, Energy Holdings considers the returns of its remaining investments against
  alternative investments across the PSEG companies, while considering the strategic fit and relative risks of these businesses

.

Energy Holdings is also considering the impact of any potential sales of its
  investments on its targeted credit metrics and debt service requirements and at present, Global anticipates that it will take into consideration an appropriate balance of the use of proceeds from any sales
  with returns of equity to PSEG and debt repayments.

Resources

Resources primarily has invested in energy-related leveraged leases. Resources is focused on maintaining its current investment portfolio and does not expect to make any new investments.

Overview of 2006

During 2006, Energy Holdings had over $600 million of proceeds from the sales of Global’s investments in two generating stations in Poland, the sale of its interest in RGE, a distribution company in
  Brazil and from its sale of its remaining 46% interest in Dhofar Power.

Energy Holdings used this cash as well as funds on hand at December 31, 2005 and cash from operations to return $520 million of capital to PSEG, redeem all $309 million of its 7.75% 2007 Senior
  Notes in January 2006 and redeem $300 million of its 8.625% 2008 Senior Notes in October 2006.

Future Outlook

Energy Holdings expects decreased margins at Global in 2007 primarily relating to the absence of mark-to-market gains, a slight reduction in spark spreads and anticipated maintenance outages at
  Texas Independent Energy L.P. (TIE)’s plants. Also contributing to the expected decrease are higher taxes, the impact of adopting FIN 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of
  FASB


Statement 109” (FIN 48) and related standards and lower earnings due to asset sales partly offset by the impact of early adoption of FAS 157.

As discussed above, Global’s earnings are primarily derived from its investments in the United States, Chile and Peru. As such, Global’s success will depend on continued strong energy markets in
  Texas and the economic and efficient operation of its electric distribution companies in Chile and Peru, including its ability to achieve reasonable rates and meeting expected growth in usage. The success of
  Global’s foreign investments will also depend on stable political, regulatory and economic policies, including foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, particularly for Chile and Peru.

Resources’ ability to realize tax benefits associated with its leveraged lease investments is dependent upon taxable income generated by its affiliates. Resources’ earnings and cash flows are expected to
  decrease in the future as the investment portfolio matures. Resources faces risks with regard to the creditworthiness of its counterparties; the weighted average credit rating of its lessees at December 31,
  2006 was A–/A3. Certain lessees’ ratings are below investment grade. The lease structures have various credit enhancement mechanisms. Resources monitors the credit rating of the lessees very closely,
  calling letters of credit and taking other measures when appropriate.

Energy Holdings also faces risks related to the tax treatment of uncertain tax positions which will be impacted by new accounting guidance under FIN 48 and FASB Staff Position No. FAS 13-2,
  “Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction”, both of which are effective as of January 1, 2007.
  Based on its evaluation of this new guidance, Energy Holdings estimates that it will record a reduction to Retained Earnings of approximately $190 million to $215 million, effective January 1, 2007. In
  addition, this new guidance will have an impact on Energy Holdings’ future revenues and earnings, including an anticipated earnings reduction of $25 million to $35 million in 2007, as compared to 2006,
  which represents the majority of the anticipated impact on PSEG. See Note 2. Recent Accounting Standards of the Notes for further discussion.

PSEG’s results of operations are primarily comprised of the results of operations of its operating subsidiaries, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, excluding changes related to intercompany
  transactions, which are eliminated in consolidation. It also includes certain financing costs at the parent company. For additional information on intercompany transactions, see Note 21. Related-Party
  Transactions of the Notes. For a discussion of the causes for the variances at PSEG in the table above, see the discussions for PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings that follow.

PSE&G

For the year ended December 31, 2006, PSE&G had Net Income of $265 million, a decrease of $83 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. This decrease was primarily due to delayed
  decisions in its electric and gas base rate cases combined with the decline in electric and gas delivery volumes. Gas delivery volumes dropped 10% in 2006 as compared with 2005 and electric delivery
  volumes were down 3%. The weather was the primary cause of these declines with a drop of 16% in the number of degree days impacting gas. Gas commodity prices were extremely high early in 2006,
  which also contributed


to a decline in weather normalized sales. THI hours were normal in 2006 but 18% less than 2005 negatively impacting electric sales.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, PSE&G had Net Income of $348 million, a $2 million increase as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. This slight increase resulted primarily from
  higher margins, due to favorable weather conditions, and reduced interest expense being substantially offset by higher Operation and Maintenance costs.

The year-over-year detail for these variances for these periods are discussed in more detail below:

Operating Revenues

PSE&G has three sources of revenue: commodity revenues from the sales of energy to customers and in the PJM spot market; delivery revenues from the transmission and distribution of energy through
  its system; and other operating revenues from the provision of various services.

PSE&G makes no margin on gas commodity sales as the costs are passed through to customers. The difference between the gas costs paid under the requirements contract for residential customers and
  the revenues received from residential customers is deferred and collected from or returned to customers in future periods. Gas commodity prices fluctuate monthly for commercial and industrial customers
  and annually through the BGSS tariff for residential customers. In addition, for residential gas customers, PSE&G has the ability to adjust rates upward two additional times and downward at any time, if
  warranted, between annual BGSS proceedings.

PSE&G makes no margin on electric commodity sales as the costs are passed through to customers. PSE&G secures its electric commodity through the annual BGS auction. Electric commodity supply
  prices are set based on the results of these auctions for residential and smaller industrial and commercial customers, and are translated into seasonally-adjusted fixed rates. Electric supply for larger
  industrial and commercial customers is provided at a rate principally based on the hourly PJM real-time energy price. Customers may obtain their electric supply through either the BGS default electric
  supply service or through competitive third-party electric suppliers, and the majority of the customers subject to hourly pricing are currently receiving electric supply from third-party suppliers. Any
  differences between amounts paid by PSE&G to BGS suppliers for electric commodity, and the amounts of electric commodity revenue collected from customers is deferred and collected or returned to
  customers in subsequent months.

The $55 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005 was due to increases of $78 million in commodity revenues and $3 million in other operating revenues offset by a
  decrease of $26 million in delivery revenues.

The $704 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004 was due to increases of $624 million in commodity revenues, $74 million in delivery revenues and $6 million in
  other operating revenues.

Commodity

The $78 million increase in commodity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was due to an increase in electric commodity revenues of $213 million offset by a decrease
  of $135 million in gas commodity revenues. The increase in electric revenues was primarily due to $299 million in higher BGS revenues (higher auction prices of $346 million offset by reduced sales of $47
  million) offset by $85 million in lower Non-Utility Generation (NUG) revenues (lower prices of $82 million and by $3 million


for lower volumes). The decrease in gas revenues was primarily due to $317 million in lower volumes due to weather and $58 million due to the expiration of the Third Party Shopping Incentive Clause in
  July 2005. There is a corresponding $58 million increase in delivery revenues. These were offset by $240 million in higher BGSS prices.

The $624 million increase in commodity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was due to increases in electric and gas revenues of $313 million and $311 million,
  respectively. The increase in electric revenues was primarily due to $216 million in higher BGS revenues (higher auction prices of $148 million and increased sales of $68 million) and $97 million in higher
  NUG revenues (higher prices of $98 million offset by $1 million for lower volumes). The increase in gas revenues was primarily due to $291 million in higher BGSS prices and $62 million in higher volumes
  due to weather offset by the decrease of $42 million due to the expiration of the Third Party Shopping Incentive Clause in July 2005. There is a corresponding $42 million increase in delivery revenues.

Delivery

The $26 million decrease in delivery revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was due to a $27 million decrease in gas and a $1 million increase in electric revenues. The
  gas decrease was due to $101 million in lower volumes primarily due to weather offset by $74 million in increased prices, $58 million of which was due to the expiration of the Third Party Shopping
  Incentive Clause in July 2005, described above in commodity revenues, $8 million due to rate relief effective November 9, 2006 and $8 million due to the Societal Benefits Clause (SBC) November 1, 2006
  rate increase. The electric increase was due primarily to $13 million in higher securitization tariff rates and $8 million from a rate increase effective November 9, 2006, offset by $20 million in lower volumes
  due to weather.

The $74 million increase in delivery revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was due to increases in electric and gas revenues of $67 million and $7 million, respectively.
  The electric increase was due primarily to $55 million in higher volumes due to weather and $12 million in higher rates. The gas increase was due to the expiration of the Third Party Shopping Incentive in
  July 2005, resulting in an increase of $42 million in delivery revenues with a corresponding offset in commodity revenues, described above, and a $12 million increase in SBC revenues (offset in Operation
  and Maintenance Costs below). This was offset by $9 million in lower volume and demand revenues due to weather and $37 million due to the expiration of the Gas Cost Underrecovery Adjustment
  (GCUA) clause in January 2005.

Operating Expenses

Energy Costs

The $128 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was comprised of an increase of $211 million in electric costs offset by a decrease of $83 million in gas costs. The
  increase in electric costs was caused by $255 million or 16% in higher prices for BGS and NUG purchases offset by $47 million in lower BGS volumes due to weather. The decrease in gas costs was caused
  by a $362 million or 17% decrease in sales volumes due primarily to weather and $8 million due to the expiration of the GCUA clause in January 2005, offset by $287 million or 11% in higher prices.

The $634 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was comprised of increases of $319 million in electric costs and $315 million in gas costs. The increase in electric
  costs was caused by a $264 million or 8% increase due to higher prices for BGS and NUG purchases and a $67 million increase due to higher BGS volumes, partially offset by a decrease of $12 million due
  to lower NUG volumes. The increased gas costs were due to a $271 million or 16% increase in gas prices and an $81 million increase in sales volumes due primarily to higher sales to cogenerators. These
  were offset by a $37 million decrease due to the expiration of the GCUA clause in January 2005.

Operation and Maintenance

The $9 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was due primarily to $9 million in increased labor and fringe benefits due to increased wages and Other
  Postretirement Benefits (OPEB) costs and $7 million in increased bad debt expense. These increases were offset by decreases of $3 million in injuries and damage claims and $2 million in write
  offs and $2 million in Net Operating Loss (NOL) purchases.


The $68 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was due to increased SBC expenses of $27 million ($15 million electric, $12 million gas); $23 million in labor and
  fringe benefits; $6 million for increased injuries and damages reserves; $4 million for Merger-related expenses; $3 million for higher regulatory commission expenses; $2 million for higher bad debt expenses
  and $2 million for the purchase of NOL. SBC costs are deferred when incurred and amortized to expense when recovered in revenues.

Depreciation and Amortization

The $67 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was comprised of increases of $70 million from the expiration of an excess depreciation credit, $6 million due to
  amortization of regulatory assets and $3 million due to additional plant in service. These increases were offset by decreases of $5 million due to revised plant depreciation and cost of removal rates, $3
  million due to software amortization and $3 million due to the amortization of the Remediation Adjustment Clause (RAC).

The $30 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was due primarily to a $33 million increase in the amortization of securitized regulatory assets, a $4 million
  increase due to additional plant in service and a $4 million increase in the amortization of the RAC. These were offset by an $8 million decrease in software amortization and a $3 million increase in excess
  depreciation reserve amortization.

Other Income and Deductions

The $10 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to an $8 million income tax gross-up on contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) in 2006.
  CIAC are taxable and PSE&G recognizes the gross-up as income when collected. Also included are increases of $1 million of short-term interest income and $1 million in gains on the sale of excess property.

Interest Expense

The $20 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to decreases of $22 million due to lower average interest rates and lower amounts of long-term
  debt outstanding, primarily offset by $5 million in higher short-term debt balances outstanding and higher interest rates.

Income Taxes

The $52 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to $55 million in lower pre-tax income offset by $3 million in various flow-through adjustments.

The $11 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to decreases of $4 million in prior period adjustments, $3 million in various flow-through
  benefits and $3 million in lower pre-tax income.

Power

For the year ended December 31, 2006, Power had Net Income of $276 million, an increase of $84 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase primarily resulted from
  higher BGS contract prices and higher sales volumes in the various power pools, supported by improved nuclear operations and the commencement of commercial operations at Linden in May 2006 and at
  the Bethlehem Energy Center (BEC) in July 2005 and lower generation costs due to lower pool prices and lower demand under the BGS contract. Power also had lower non-trading mark-to-market losses,
  which were approximately $1 million, after-tax, in 2006 as compared to $8 million, after-tax, in 2005. Power’s increased earnings were partially offset by reduced margins on BGSS, as market prices for
  natural gas declined from historically high price levels experienced in the second half of 2005 while the cost of gas in inventory was reasonably stable, and lower demand in 2006 due to a warmer winter
  heating system and customer conservation. Power’s earnings were also offset by a $44 million write-down of four gas engine turbines which are planned for sale in 2007, a $30 million after-tax decrease in
  Income from the NDT Funds and higher Operation and


Maintenance Costs, Depreciation and Amortization and Interest Expense related to operation of the Linden and BEC facilities.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, Power had Net Income of $192 million, a decrease of $116 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The primary reason for the decrease was
  the $178 million Loss on Disposal of Waterford and the $16 million Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle recorded in 2005. Power’s Income from Continuing Operations for the year
  ended December 31, 2005 was $434 million, an increase of $67 million as compared to 2004. This increase reflected higher pricing and increased sales in the various power pools and new wholesale contracts
  and reduced Operation and Maintenance costs associated with the outage at Hope Creek in 2004. Marked improvement in Power’s nuclear operations provided additional low-cost energy to satisfy Power’s
  contractual obligations and to sell into the market at higher prices. The increases at Power were partially offset by interest and depreciation costs related to facilities in Albany, New York, which
  commenced operation in July 2005 and Lawrenceburg, Indiana, which commenced operation in June 2004.

The year-over-year detail for these variances for these periods are discussed in more detail below:

Operating Revenues

The $30 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to 2005 was due to increases of $239 million in generation revenues and $27 million in trading revenues, which were
  partially offset by a decrease of $236 million in gas supply revenues.

The $861 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was due to increases of $543 million in generation revenues and $368 million in gas supply revenues, which were
  partially offset by a decrease of $50 million in trading revenues.

Generation

The $239 million increase in generation revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to an increase of $238 million from higher sales volumes in the various
  power pools, supported by improved nuclear operations and the commencement of the commercial operations of Linden in May 2006 and BEC in July 2005, partially offset by lower pool prices. Also
  contributing to the increase was $92 million of higher BGS contract revenues due to higher contract prices which were partly offset by a reduction in load being served under the fixed-price BGS contracts
  and termination of BGS hourly contracts in May 2006. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of $58 million due to certain wholesale contracts ending in 2005 and early 2006 and $33 million of
  unrealized losses on asset-backed electric forward contracts.

The $543 million increase in generation revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to higher revenues of $226 million from higher pricing and increased
  sales in the various power pools supported by improved nuclear capacity, partially offset by reduced load being served under the fixed-priced BGS contracts. Also contributing to the increase were increases
  of $103 million from new wholesale contracts, $74 million from operations in New York, largely due to the commencement of


BEC’s operations, $65 million from RMR revenues, which Power began receiving in 2005 for certain of its generating facilities, and $75 million from increased ancillary services and operating reserves.

Gas Supply

The $236 million decrease in gas supply revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to decreases of $334 million due to lower demand under the BGSS
  contract in 2006 due to a warmer winter heating season and improved customer conservation in 2006 and a $94 million in decreased prices and gas volumes and pipeline capacity sold to other gas
  distributors. The decreases were partially offset by an increase of $188 million due to higher prices under the BGSS contract.

The $368 million increase in gas supply revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was principally due to higher prices under the BGSS contract for gas and pipeline capacity
  partially offset by lower demand, largely resulting from a warmer winter heating season in 2005 as compared to 2004.

Trading

The $27 million increase in trading revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was principally due to higher realized gains related to emissions credits.

The $50 million decrease in trading revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, resulted principally from reductions in realized gains related to emission credits.

Operating Expenses

Energy Costs

Energy Costs represent the cost of generation, which includes fuel purchases for generation as well as purchased energy in the market, and gas purchases to meet Power’s obligation under its BGSS
  contract with PSE&G.

The $311 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to decreases of $267 million from lower pool prices and lower demand under the BGS
  contract, $144 million from a reduced volume of gas purchased to satisfy Power’s BGSS obligations, somewhat offset by higher gas prices related to inventory for the 2005/2006 winter heating season, and
  $58 million due to favorable pricing of fuel-related asset-backed transactions in 2006. These decreases were partially offset by $80 million of losses realized on gas hedges in 2006, an increase of $42 million
  in fuel costs and an increase of $35 million in transmission fees. The increase in fuel costs was largely due to higher volumes of gas purchased to meet increased production by the gas-fired plants, including
  Linden and BEC, and higher oil prices, partially offset by lower gas prices during 2006 and a lower volume of oil purchases due to reduced running times of certain of the oil-fired plants in 2006.

The $713 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to increased generation costs, reflecting higher fossil fuel prices and higher prices on an
  increased volume of purchased power for new contracts and higher prices for gas purchased to satisfy Power’s BGSS obligations.

Operation and Maintenance

The $19 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was principally due to higher maintenance costs of $60 million related to certain of the fossil plants and scheduled
  outages at the nuclear units. These increases were partially offset by the absence of a $14 million restructuring charge recorded in 2005 related to Nuclear’s workforce realignment plan, a decrease of $10
  million in payroll and benefits due to a reduction in employees and a decrease of $14 million in fees paid to Services for information technology and various administrative services.

The $9 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to a decrease of $36 million in equipment repair costs related to outages at the nuclear facilities,
  $9 million of lower real estate taxes, $5 million of lower transmission fees in the power pools, $4 million of lower expenses related to reduced trading activities in 2005 and an $8 million settlement of co-
  owner billings in 2004 related to Power’s jointly-owned facilities. The decreases were substantially offset by an increase of $11 million in pension, postretirement and other employee benefits, a $16 million
  increase attributable to repairs for


outages at the fossil generation plants, the aforementioned $14 million restructuring charge and a $12 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in 2004.

Write-Down of Assets

The $44 million write-down of assets recorded in 2006 related to four turbines for which Power has no immediate use and intends to sell. For additional information, see Note 4. Discontinued
  Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments of the Notes.

Depreciation and Amortization

The $26 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to the Linden and BEC plants being placed into service in May 2006 and July 2005, respectively.

The $16 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to the BEC facility being placed into service and a higher depreciable asset base in 2005 at
  Nuclear.

Other Income and Deductions

The $78 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to decreased net realized income of $29 million and increased realized losses of $19 million
  related to the NDT Funds. Also contributing to the decrease were charges recorded in 2006 of $14 million for an other-than-temporary impairment of certain NDT Fund securities and $14 million for
  penalties related to negotiations concerning environmental concerns and an alternate pollution reduction plan for Power’s Hudson unit.

The $27 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to increased realized gains and income of $13 million related to the NDT Funds, lower realized
  losses of $8 million in 2005 on NDT Funds and a $5 million gain from the sale in September 2005 of four gas turbine generators located in Burlington, New Jersey.

The $48 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was due primarily to lower capitalized interest costs in 2006 related to commencement of operations of the Linden
  and BEC facilities.

The $10 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was due primarily to $8 million of lower capitalized interest costs in 2005 related to commencement of operations
  of BEC.

Income Taxes

The $45 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to higher pre-tax income.

The $91 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to an increase of $63 million in taxes on pre-tax income, the recording in 2005 of $15 million of
  taxes for the NDT Funds and the reversal in 2004 of $16 million of contingency reserves and other prior period adjustments.

Loss from Discontinued Operations, including Loss on Disposal, net of tax

On December 29, 2006, Power entered into an agreement to sell its Lawrenceburg generation facility for approximately $325 million and recognized an estimated loss on disposal of $208 million, net of
  tax, in December 2006, for the initial write-down of its carrying amount of Lawrenceburg to its fair value less cost to sell. The transaction is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2007. Losses from
  Discontinued Operations of Lawrenceburg, not including the estimated Loss of Disposal, were $31 million, $28 million and $25 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

On May 27, 2005, Power reached an agreement to sell its Waterford generation facility for approximately $220 million and recognized an estimated loss on disposal of $177 million, net of tax, for the
  initial write-down of its carrying amount of Waterford to its fair value less cost to sell. On September 28,


2005, Power completed the sale of Waterford and recognized an additional loss of $1 million. Losses from Discontinued Operations of Waterford, not including the Loss of Disposal, were $20 million and
  $34 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments of the Notes for additional information.

Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle

For the year ended December 31, 2005, Power recorded an after-tax loss in the amount of $16 million due to the required recording of a liability for the fair value of asset-retirement costs primarily
  related to its generation plants under FIN 47, which was adopted in December 2005. See Note 3. Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes for additional information.

Energy Holdings

For the year ended December 31, 2006, Energy Holdings had Net Income of $275 million, an increase of $58 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Included in Energy Holdings’
  Net Income for 2006 was a $178 million after-tax loss on the sale of RGE, which was more than offset by the $226 million after-tax gain on disposal of Elcho and Skawina. Strong operations combined with
  approximately $29 million of after-tax mark-to-market gains on forward gas contracts in 2006 as compared to $3 million of after-tax mark-to-market losses in 2005 at TIE and higher sales volumes at
  Sociedad Austral de Electricidad S.A. (SAESA) also contributed to the increase. The increases were partially offset by the absence of an after-tax gain of $43 million from the sale of Resources’ leveraged
  lease investment in Generation Station Unit 2 (Seminole) in December 2005.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, Energy Holdings had Net Income of $217 million, an increase of $76 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase was primarily due
  to higher earnings due to improved operations at TIE and in South America and the aforementioned gain on the sale of Seminole in December 2005.

The year-over-year detail for these variances for these periods are discussed in more detail below:

The classification of the results of Global’s investments on Energy Holdings’ Consolidated Financial Statements is dependent upon Global’s ownership percentage in the underlying investment which
  determines whether the investment is consolidated into Energy Holdings’ Consolidated Financial Statements or if it is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Global owns 100% of TIE,
  SAESA and Electroandes S.A. (Electroandes) and 85% of Prisma 2000 S.p.A. (Prisma). As a result, the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of those investments are reflected on Energy Holdings’
  Consolidated Financial Statements. Global’s investments in Chilquinta Energia (Chilquinta), Luz del Sur S.A.A. (LDS), GWF, Kalaeloa Partners L.P. ( Kalaeloa) and several other smaller investments are
  accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Therefore, Energy Holdings only records its share of the net income from these projects as Income from Equity Method Investments on its
  Consolidated Statements of Operations.


The variances in Operating Revenues, Energy Costs, Operation and Maintenance, Depreciation and Amortization and Income from Equity Method Investments were primarily attributed to Global’s
  increased revenues at TIE in 2006, as compared to same period in 2005, primarily due to unrealized gains on forward contracts and a stronger market and stronger spark spread (the difference between the
  market price of electricity and the cost of natural gas fuel), the consolidation of Prisma in May 2006, which generated $32 million of revenue, and Global’s sale of a 35% interest in Dhofar Power Company
  S.A.O.C. (Dhofar Power) through a public offering on the Omani Stock Exchange in April 2005 and sale of its remaining interest of 46% in November 2006, receiving net proceeds after-tax of
  approximately $31 million, the approximate book value of the investment. The variances are also related to favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher energy sales volumes at SAESA.

Operating Revenues

The increase of $55 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was due to higher revenues at Global of $128 million, which was primarily related to a $79 million increase at
  TIE due to higher unrealized gains on forward contracts which were slightly offset by a reduction in gas sales. Also contributing to the increase at Global was a $78 million increase at SAESA in Chile due
  to higher energy sales volumes as well as tariff increases and favorable foreign currency exchange rates, a $24 million increase due to the consolidation of Prisma and $10 million of increased revenue from
  Electroandes due to volume and price increases. These increases were partly offset by a $37 million decrease due to the absence of a gain from withdrawal from the Eagle Point Cogeneration Partnership in
  the prior year and the absence of $20 million of revenue due to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power. Offsetting the increases at Global were lower revenues at Resources of $73 million primarily due to the
  absence of a $71 million pre-tax gain from the sale of Resources’ interest in Seminole Generation in December 2005 coupled with the absence of $20 million of leveraged lease income in 2006 due to the
  Seminole sale, partially offset by a $21 million write-off of a leveraged lease investment with United Airlines in 2005.

The increase of $466 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was due to higher revenues at Global of $406 million, including a $279 million increase related to the
  consolidation of TIE commencing July 1, 2004 and $136 million due to higher revenues at TIE in the second half of 2005 and a $62 million increase related to SAESA due to higher energy sales volumes
  offset by a $43 million decrease related to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power and the absence of a $35 million gain on the sale of Meiya Power Company Limited (MPC) in 2004. Also contributing to the
  increase were higher revenues at Resources of $60 million primarily due to the $71 million pre-tax gain recognized in 2005 from the sale of its interest in Seminole offset by the absence of an $11 million
  pre-tax charge recorded due to the termination of the lease investment in the Collins generating facility in 2004.

Energy Costs

The increase of $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to a $59 million increase at SAESA due to increased volume and higher spot prices for
  energy and an $8 million increase due to the consolidation of Prisma in May 2006, partially offset by a $5 million decrease related to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power.

The increase of $353 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to a $219 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE commencing July 1, 2004, a
  $99 million increase in energy costs at TIE in the second half of 2005 and a $44 million increase related to SAESA due to significant increases in Energy Costs, offset by a $13 million decrease related to the
  deconsolidation of Dhofar Power.

Operation and Maintenance

The decrease of $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to a reduction of $9 million at Resources mainly due to a reduction of operating lease expense. The decrease is also due to a $4 million reduction in administrative expenses related to lower corporate assessments, wages and benefits, and legal and consulting expense. These decreases are offset by an $8 million increase at Global due to a $17 million increase related to the operations of SAESA, $5 million increase due to the consolidation of Prisma partially offset by a $9 million decrease at TIE and a $4 million decrease from the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power.


The increase of $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to a $41 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE commencing July 1, 2004 and a
  $14 million increase related to SAESA offset by a $6 million decrease related to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power and a $7 million decrease in energy costs at TIE in the second half of 2005.

Write-Down of Assets

The $274 million write-down of assets is primarily related to a $263 million pre-tax loss on Global’s sale of its 32% indirect ownership interest in RGE, $4 million pre-tax loss related to the sale of
  Global’s interest in Magellan Capital Holdings Corporation (MCHC), and a $7 million pre-tax loss on the impairment of Global’s generation projects in Venezuela. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations,
  Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments of the Notes.

Depreciation and Amortization

The increase of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to a $3 million increase at Resources and a $3 million increase at Global due to a $4 million
  increase related to the consolidation of Prisma and an increase of $3 million at SAESA, offset by a $4 million decrease resulting from the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power.

The increase of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to an $8 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE commencing July 1, 2004 and a $2
  million increase related to Resources due to the conversion of the Delta and Northwest leases from leveraged leases to operating leases, offset by a $9 million decrease related to the deconsolidation of
  Dhofar Power.

Income from Equity Method Investments

The decrease of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily driven by the absence of $12 million of earnings due to the sale of RGE in 2006 partially offset by
  the absence of foreign currency losses in 2005 from Prisma of $8 million.

The increase of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to a $20 million increase due to stronger results in South America (RGE and Chilquinta)
  offset by an $11 million decrease related to the loss of earnings associated with the sale of Global’s equity interest in MPC in December 2004 and a $3 million decrease related to Global’s investment in
  Prisma.

Other Income and Deductions

The increase of $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily due to an increase in interest and dividend income of approximately $10 million and lower losses
  in foreign currency transactions due to favorable currency fluctuations mainly for Prisma operations in Italy.

The decrease of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $7 million and foreign currency transaction losses
  of $9 million primarily on notes receivables from Prisma, partially offset by interest income from PSEG related to inter-company loans.

Interest Expense

The decrease of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was mainly due to a decrease in Energy Holdings’ debt outstanding and a net decrease of $2 million resulting
  from the consolidation of Prisma and the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power.

The $10 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2005, respectively, as compared to 2004, was primarily due an $11 million decrease related to the deconsolidation of Dhofar Power in May
  2005 and an $8 million decrease related to Resources due to a reduction in intercompany interest charges offset by a $9 million increase related to the consolidation of TIE commencing on July 1, 2004.


Income Taxes

The decrease of $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily attributable to a tax benefit resulting from Global’s sale of its 32% indirect ownership interest in
  RGE and sale of SAESA’s 50% interest in Empresa de Energia Rio Negro S.A. (Argentine utility operation).

The $24 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, was primarily due to the recording of $11 million of U.S. tax associated with repatriation of funds under the
  American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act), an increase in the mix of domestic earnings for Global due to improved results at TIE, taxes recognized of $28 million from the sale of Seminole and
  additional benefits resulting from revisions to Resources’ lease runs performed in the fourth quarter of 2005. For further information on lease runs, see below in Resources’ forecast of state taxable income
  and tax liability over the relevant lease terms. This forecast was embedded in the lease reruns and led to an income tax benefit of $43 million in 2004 to reflect the cumulative benefit of this adjustment. This
  benefit was largely offset by the tax impact associated with a $31 million decrease in leveraged lease revenue.

Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, including Gain (Loss) on Disposal, net of tax

Elcho and Skawina

In 2006, Global sold its interest in two coal-fired plants in Poland, Elcho and Skawina. Proceeds, net of transaction costs, were $476 million, resulting in a gain of $227 million net of tax expense of $142
  million. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations related to Elcho and Skawina for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $227 million, $18 million and $(10) million, respectively. See
  Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments of the Notes for additional information.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The following discussion of liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis for PSEG, noting the uses and contributions of PSEG’s three direct operating subsidiaries, PSE&G, Power and Energy
  Holdings.

Financing Methodology

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

Capital requirements for PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are met through liquidity provided by internally generated cash flow and external financings. PSEG expects to be able to fund existing
  commitments, reduce debt and meet dividend requirements using internally generated cash. PSEG, Power and Energy Holdings from time to time make equity contributions or otherwise provide credit
  support to their respective direct and indirect subsidiaries to provide for part of their capital and cash requirements, generally relating to long-term investments. PSEG does not intend to contribute
  additional equity to Energy Holdings.

At times, PSEG utilizes intercompany dividends and intercompany loans (except however, that PSE&G may not, without prior BPU approval, and Fossil, Nuclear and ER&T may not without prior FERC approval make loans to their affiliates) to satisfy various
  subsidiary or parental needs and efficiently manage short-term cash. Any excess funds are invested in short-term liquid investments.

External funding to meet PSEG’s, PSE&G’s and Power’s needs and a majority portion of the requirements of Energy Holdings consist of corporate finance transactions. The debt incurred is the direct
  obligation of those respective entities. Some of the proceeds of these debt transactions may be used by the respective obligor to make equity investments in its subsidiaries.

As discussed below, depending on the particular company, external financing may consist of public and private capital market debt and equity transactions, bank revolving credit and term loans,
  commercial paper and/or project financings. Some of these transactions involve special purpose entities (SPEs), formed in accordance with applicable tax and legal requirements in order to achieve specified
  financial advantages, such as favorable legal liability treatment. PSEG consolidates SPEs, as applicable, in accordance with FIN No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)” (FIN 46). See
  Note 2. Recent Accounting Standards of the Notes.


The availability and cost of external capital is affected by each entity’s performance, as well as by the performance of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates. This could include the degree of
  structural separation between PSEG and its subsidiaries and the potential impact of affiliate ratings on consolidated and unconsolidated credit quality. Additionally, compliance with applicable financial
  covenants will depend upon future financial position, earnings and net cash flows, as to which no assurances can be given.

Over the next several years, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings may be required to extinguish or refinance maturing debt and, to the extent there is not sufficient internally generated funds,
  may incur additional debt and/or provide equity to fund investment activities. Any inability to obtain required additional external capital or to extend or replace maturing debt and/or existing agreements at
  current levels and reasonable interest rates may adversely affect PSEG’s, PSE&G’s, Power’s and Energy Holdings’ respective financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

From time to time, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings may repurchase portions of their respective debt securities using funds from operations, asset sales, commercial paper, debt issuances,
  equity issuances and other sources of funding and may make exchanges of new securities, including common stock, for outstanding securities. Such repurchases may be at variable prices below, at or above
  prevailing market prices and may be conducted by way of privately negotiated transactions, open-market purchases, tender or exchange offers or other means. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings
  may utilize brokers or dealers or effect such repurchases directly. Any such repurchases may be commenced or discontinued at any time without notice.

Energy Holdings

A portion of the financing for Global’s investments is normally provided by non-recourse financing transactions. These consist of loans from banks and other lenders that are typically secured by project
  assets and cash flows. Non-recourse transactions generally impose no material obligation on the parent-level investor to repay any debt incurred by the project borrower. The consequences of permitting a
  project-level default include the potential for loss of any invested equity by the parent. However, in some cases, certain obligations relating to the investment being financed, including additional equity
  commitments, may be guaranteed by Global and/or Energy Holdings for their respective subsidiaries. PSEG does not provide guarantees or credit support to Energy Holdings or its subsidiaries.

Operating Cash Flows

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

PSEG expects strong cash from operations primarily driven by earnings from Power supported by improved energy margins and capacity markets. Operating cash flows are expected to be sufficient to
  fund capital expenditures and shareholder dividend payments, with excess cash available to invest in the business, reduce debt and/or repurchase common stock.

PSEG

For the year ended December 31, 2006, PSEG’s operating cash flow increased by approximately $959 million from $970 million to $1.9 billion, as compared to 2005, due to net increases from its
  subsidiaries as discussed below.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, PSEG’s operating cash flow decreased by approximately $635 million from $1.6 billion to $970 million, as compared to 2004, primarily due to net decreases at
  Power for its working capital requirements, discussed below.

PSE&G

PSE&G’s operating cash flow increased approximately $115 million from $689 million to $804 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to a decrease in customer
  receivables, reflecting lower sales volumes due to a warmer winter heating season and lower gas prices in 2006.

PSE&G’s operating cash flow decreased approximately $7 million from $696 million to $689 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004.


Power

Power’s operating cash flow increased approximately $907 million from $136 million to $1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, due to a significant reduction in margin
  requirements and fuel inventories, largely resulting from decreases in commodity prices.

Power’s operating cash flow decreased approximately $371 million from $507 million to $136 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004 primarily due to increased margin
  requirements and an increase in fuel inventory because of significantly increased commodity prices.

Energy Holdings

Energy Holdings’ operating cash flow decreased approximately $114 million from $273 million to $159 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005. The decrease was mainly due
  to taxes paid related to the sale of Elcho, Skawina and RGE in 2006. The proceeds from the these sales are included in Cash Flows from Investing Activities on Energy Holdings’ Consolidated Statements
  of Cash Flows.

Energy Holdings’ operating cash flow decreased approximately $130 million from $403 million to $273 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 2004, due primarily to a decrease
  in Resources’ cash flows, which was driven by the timing of receipt of tax benefits, and the monetization of the remaining receivables of PETAMC in 2004.

Common Stock Dividends

Dividend payments on common stock for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $2.28 per share and totaled approximately $574 million. Dividend payments on common stock for the year ended
  December 31, 2005 were $2.24 per share and totaled approximately $541 million. Future dividends declared will be dependent upon PSEG’s future earnings, cash flows, financial requirements, alternative
  investment opportunities and other factors. On January 17, 2007, PSEG announced an increase in its dividend from $0.57 to $0.585 per share for the first quarter of 2007. This quarterly increase reflects an
  indicated annual dividend rate of $2.34 per share.

Short-Term Liquidity

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

In December 2006, PSEG and Power established new credit facilities, which are available for letters of credit and short-term funding, replacing their previous credit facilities. PSEG’s new facility also
  provides liquidity backup for its $1 billion commercial paper program. Also in December 2006, PSE&G amended its $600 million credit facility to update the terms and extend the expiration date to June
  2011.

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings each believe that sufficient liquidity exists to fund their respective short-term cash needs.

As of December 31, 2006, PSEG and its subsidiaries had a total of approximately $3.7 billion of committed credit facilities with approximately $3.3 billion of available liquidity under these facilities. In
  addition, PSEG and PSE&G have access to certain uncommitted credit facilities. Each of the facilities is restricted to availability and use to the specific companies as listed below. As of December 31, 2006,
  PSEG has no loans outstanding under its uncommitted facility and PSE&G had $31 million of loans outstanding under its uncommitted facility.

Power

As of December 31, 2006, Power had borrowed $54 million from PSEG in the form of an intercompany loan.

During the year ending December 31, 2006, Power’s required margin postings for sales contracts entered into in the normal course of business decreased as commodity prices declined. The required
  margin postings will fluctuate based on volatility in commodity prices. Should commodity prices rise, additional margin calls may be necessary relative to existing power sales contracts. As Power’s contract
  obligations are fulfilled, liquidity requirements are reduced.

In addition, ER&T maintains agreements that require Power, as its guarantor under performance guarantees, to satisfy certain creditworthiness standards. In the event of a deterioration of Power’s credit
  rating to below investment grade, which represents at least a two level downgrade from its current ratings, many of these agreements allow the counterparty to demand that ER&T provide performance
  assurance, generally in the form of a letter of credit or cash. Providing this support would increase Power’s costs of doing business and could restrict the ability of ER&T to manage and optimize Power’s asset
  portfolio. Power believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet any required posting of collateral resulting from a credit rating downgrade. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes for
  further information.

Energy Holdings

Energy Holdings and its subsidiaries had $98 million in cash, including $38 million invested offshore as of December 31, 2006. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, Energy Holdings had an outstanding
  demand loan receivable from PSEG of $28 million. See External Financings—Energy Holdings below for Energy Holdings’ additional use of its excess cash.


External Financings

PSEG

On September 1, 2006, PSEG began using treasury stock to settle the exercise of stock options. Prior to September 1, 2006, PSEG had purchased shares on the open market to meet the exercise of
  stock options. As of December 31, 2006, PSEG issued 410,365 shares of its common treasury stock in connection with settling stock options for approximately $15 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, PSEG issued approximately 1 million shares of its common stock under its Dividend Reinvestment Program and its Employee Stock Purchase Program for
  approximately $68 million.

In October 2006, PSEG repaid $49 million of its 6.89% Senior Notes which are due in equal installment payments through 2009.

In February 2006, PSEG redeemed $154 million of its Subordinated Debentures underlying $150 million of Enterprise Capital Trust II, Floating Rate Capital Securities and its common equity
  investment in the trust.

PSE&G

On June 23, 2006, PSE&G repaid at maturity $175 million of its Floating Rate Series A First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds.

On March 1, 2006, PSE&G repaid at maturity $147 million of its 6.75% Series UU First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds.

In December 2006, PSE&G issued $250 million of 5.70% Secured Medium Term Notes Series D due 2036. The proceeds were used to replace in part the aforementioned matured Floating Rate Series A
  and 6.75% Series UU First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, PSE&G Transition Funding LLC (Transition Funding) and PSE&G Transition Funding II LLC (Transition Funding II) repaid approximately $155 million and $8
  million, respectively, of their transition bonds.

On January 2, 2007, PSE&G repaid at maturity $113 million of its 6.25% Series WW First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds.

Power

In April 2006, Power repaid at maturity $500 million of its 6.875% Senior Notes.

Energy Holdings

In January 2006, Energy Holdings redeemed all $309 million of its 7.75% Senior Notes due in 2007.

On February 17, 2006, the maturity of the Odessa–Ector Power Partners, L.P. (Odessa) debt was extended to December 31, 2009. Interest on the debt is based on a spread (currently 2.25%) above
  LIBOR. On September 29, 2006, an interest rate swap took effect which converted the floating LIBOR interest rate on approximately 80% of Odessa’s debt to a fixed rate of 5.4275% through December
  31, 2009.

On October 23, 2006, Energy Holdings redeemed $300 million of its $507 million outstanding 8.625% Senior Notes due in 2008.

During 2006, Energy Holdings made cash distributions to PSEG totaling $520 million in the form of returns of capital.

Also during 2006, Energy Holdings’ subsidiaries repaid approximately $51 million of non-recourse debt, of which $43 million primarily related to SAESA and TIE, $6 million by Resources and $2
  million by EGDC.

Debt Covenants

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

PSEG’s, PSE&G’s, Power’s and Energy Holdings’ respective credit agreements may contain maximum debt to equity ratios, minimum cash flow tests and other restrictive covenants and conditions to
  borrowing. Compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon the respective future financial position, level of earnings and cash flows of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, as to
  which no assurances can be given. The ratios presented below are for the benefit of the investors of the related securities to which the covenants apply. They are not intended as financial performance or
  liquidity measures. The debt


underlying the preferred securities of PSEG, which is presented in Long-Term Debt in accordance with FIN 46, is not included as debt when calculating these ratios, as provided for in the various credit
  agreements.

Energy Holdings’ credit agreement also contains customary provisions under which the lender could refuse to advance loans in the event of a material adverse change in the borrower’s business or
  financial condition.

PSEG

Financial covenants contained in PSEG’s credit facilities include a ratio of debt (excluding non-recourse project financings, securitization debt and debt underlying preferred securities and including
  commercial paper and loans, certain letters of credit not related to collateral postings for commodity/energy contracts and similar instruments) to total capitalization (including preferred securities
  outstanding and excluding any impacts for Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income adjustments related to marking energy contracts to market and equity reductions from the funded status of pensions
  or benefit plans associated with SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”) covenant. This covenant requires that such ratio not be more than
  70.0%. As of December 31, 2006, PSEG’s ratio of debt to capitalization (as defined above) was 51.6%.

PSE&G

Financial covenants contained in PSE&G’s credit facilities include a ratio of long-term debt (excluding securitization debt, long-term debt maturing within one year and short-term debt) to total
  capitalization covenant. This covenant requires that such ratio will not be more than 65.0%. As of December 31, 2006, PSE&G’s ratio of long-term debt to total capitalization (as defined above) was 48.5%.

In addition, under its First and Refunding Mortgage (Mortgage), PSE&G may issue new First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds against previous additions and improvements, provided that its ratio of
  earnings to fixed charges calculated in accordance with its Mortgage is at least 2 to 1, and/or against retired Mortgage Bonds. As of December 31, 2006, PSE&G’s Mortgage coverage ratio was 4.1 to 1 and the
  Mortgage would permit up to approximately $2.1 billion aggregate principal amount of new Mortgage Bonds to be issued against previous additions and improvements.

Power

Financial covenants contained in Power’s credit facility include a ratio of debt to total capitalization covenant. The Power ratio is the same debt to total capitalization calculation as set forth above for
  PSEG except common equity is adjusted for the $986 million Basis Adjustment (see Consolidated Balance Sheets). This covenant requires that such ratio will not exceed 65.0%. As of December 31, 2006,
  Power’s ratio of debt to total capitalization (as defined above) was 38.4%.

Energy Holdings

Energy Holdings’ bank revolving credit agreement has a covenant requiring the ratio of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to fixed charges to be greater than
  or equal to 1.75. As of December 31, 2006, Energy Holdings’ coverage of this covenant was 3.53. Additionally, Energy Holdings must maintain a ratio of net debt (recourse debt offset by funds loaned to
  PSEG) to EBITDA of less than 5.25. As of December 31, 2006, Energy Holdings’ ratio under this covenant was 2.59. Energy Holdings is a co-borrower under this facility with Global and Resources, which
  are joint and several obligors. The terms of the agreement include a pledge of Energy Holdings’ membership interest in Global, restrictions on the use of proceeds related to material sales of assets and the
  satisfaction of certain financial covenants. Net cash proceeds from asset sales in excess of 5% of total assets of Energy Holdings during any 12-month period must be used to repay any outstanding amounts
  under the credit agreement. Net cash proceeds from asset sales during any 12-month period in excess of 10% of total assets must be retained by Energy Holdings or used to repay the debt of Energy
  Holdings, Global or Resources.

Energy Holdings’ indenture with respect to its senior notes does not permit liens securing indebtedness in excess of 10% of consolidated net tangible assets as calculated under the terms of the
  indenture. The terms of Energy Holdings’ Senior Notes allow the holders to demand repayment if a transaction or series of related transactions causes the assets of Resources to be reduced by 20% or more
  and as a direct result there is a downgrade of ratings.


Cross Default Provisions

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

The PSEG bank credit agreement contains default provisions under which a default by it in an aggregate amount of $50 million or greater would result in the potential acceleration of payment under
  this agreement. Under certain conditions, a default by PSE&G or Power in an aggregate amount of $50 million or greater would also result in potential acceleration of payment under this agreement. PSEG
  has removed Energy Holdings from all cross default provisions.

PSEG’s bank credit agreement and note purchase agreements related to private placement of debt (collectively, Credit Agreements) contain cross default provisions under which certain payment
  defaults by PSE&G or Power, certain bankruptcy events relating to PSE&G or Power, the failure by PSE&G or Power to satisfy certain final judgments or the occurrence of certain events of default under the
  financing agreements of PSE&G or Power, would each constitute an event of default under the PSEG Credit Agreements. Under the note purchase agreements, it is also an event of default if PSE&G or Power
  ceases to be wholly-owned by PSEG. Under the bank credit agreement, both PSE&G and Power would have to cease to be wholly-owned by PSEG before an event of default would occur.

PSE&G

PSE&G’s Mortgage has no cross defaults. The PSE&G Medium-Term Note Indenture has a cross default to the PSE&G Mortgage. The PSE&G credit agreement has a provision under which a default by
  PSE&G in the aggregate of $50 million or greater would result in an event of default and the potential acceleration of payment under that agreement.

Power

The Power Senior Debt Indenture contains a default provision under which a default by Power, Nuclear, Fossil or ER&T in an aggregate amount of $50 million or greater would result in an event of
  default and the potential acceleration of payment under the indenture. There are no cross defaults within Power’s indenture from PSEG, Energy Holdings or PSE&G.

The Power credit agreement also has a provision under which a default by Power, Nuclear, Fossil or ER&T in an aggregate amount of $50 million or greater would result in an event of default and the
  potential acceleration of payment under that agreement.

Energy Holdings

Energy Holdings’ credit agreement and Senior Note Indenture contain default provisions under which a default by it, Resources or Global in an aggregate amount of $25 million or greater would result
  in an event of default and the potential acceleration of payment under that agreement or the Indenture.

Ratings Triggers

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

The debt indentures and credit agreements of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings do not contain any material ‘ratings triggers’ that would cause an acceleration of the required interest and
  principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. However, in the event of a downgrade, any one or more of the affected companies may be subject to increased interest costs on certain bank debt
  and certain collateral requirements.

PSE&G

In accordance with the BPU approved requirements under the BGS contracts that PSE&G enters into with suppliers, PSE&G is required to maintain an investment grade credit rating. If PSE&G were to
  lose its investment grade rating, PSE&G would be required to file with the BPU a plan to assure continued payment for the BGS requirements of its customers.

PSE&G is the servicer for the bonds issued by Transition Funding and Transition Funding II. If PSE&G were to lose its investment grade rating, PSE&G would be required to remit collected cash daily to
  the bond trustee. Currently, cash is remitted monthly.


Power

In connection with the management and optimization of Power’s asset portfolio, ER&T maintains underlying agreements that require Power, as its guarantor under performance guarantees, to satisfy
  certain creditworthiness standards. In the event of a deterioration of Power’s credit rating to below an investment grade rating, many of these agreements allow the counterparty to demand that ER&T
  provide performance assurance, generally in the form of a letter of credit or cash. As of December 31, 2006, if Power were to lose its investment grade rating and assuming all the counterparties to
  agreements in which ER&T is “out-of-the-money” were contractually entitled to demand, and demanded, performance assurance, ER&T could be required to post collateral in an amount equal to
  approximately $578 million. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes.

Credit Ratings

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

Following the termination of the Merger Agreement in September 2006, credit ratings remained unchanged as shown in the table below. Standard & Poor’s (S&P) affirmed its “BBB” corporate credit
  rating for PSEG, Power, and PSE&G. S&P revised its outlook from watch developing to negative. Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) affirmed its credit ratings for PSEG and PSE&G while revising the
  outlooks from stable to negative. The ratings and outlooks for Power and Energy Holdings were unchanged by Moody’s. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) announced there would be no immediate impact on ratings
  and outlooks for PSEG and its subsidiaries. At that time, the agencies noted that the ratings below were predicated on continued improvement in financial metrics, specifically operating cash flows and
  ongoing deleveraging, as well as continued strong operating performance from Power’s generating units and reasonable outcomes to PSE&G’s pending electric and gas rate cases.

If the rating agencies lower or withdraw the credit ratings, such revisions may adversely affect the market price of PSEG’s, PSE&G’s, Power’s and Energy Holdings’ securities and serve to materially
  increase those companies’ cost of capital and limit their access to capital. Outlooks assigned to ratings are as follows: stable, negative (Neg) or positive (Pos). There is no assurance that the ratings will
  continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised by the rating agencies, if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. Each rating given by an agency should be evaluated
  independently of the other agencies’ ratings. The ratings should not be construed as an indication to buy, hold or sell any security.

Other Comprehensive Income

PSEG, Power and Energy Holdings

For the year ended December 31, 2006, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings had Other Comprehensive Income of $706 million, $5 million, $483 million and $217 million, respectively, due
  primarily to a reduction in the net unrealized losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges in accordance with SFAS 133 at Power and foreign currency translation adjustments at Energy Holdings.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, Power’s Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss decreased from $487 million to $177 million. The primary cause was a decrease of approximately $310
  million related to energy and related contracts that qualify for hedge accounting that were entered into by Power in the normal course of business. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the decrease in
  gas and electric prices resulted in a reduction in unrealized losses on many of those contracts, which are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. This decrease was partially offset by a $173
  million adjustment recorded at Power in connection with the adoption of SFAS 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”

(SFAS 158).

As of December 31, 2006, Energy Holdings had Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income of $103 million. The primary reasons for the improvement, as compared to the Accumulated Other
  Comprehensive Loss of $110 million as of December 31, 2005, were the realization of losses on Brazilian currency as a result of the sale of RGE and the unwinding of an interest rate swap due to the sale of
  Global’s facilities in Poland.


CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

It is expected that the majority of each subsidiary’s capital requirements over the next five years will come from internally generated funds. Projected construction and investment expenditures,
  excluding nuclear fuel purchases, for PSEG’s subsidiaries for the next five years are presented in the table below. These amounts are subject to change, based on various factors.

PSE&G

In 2006, PSE&G made approximately $528 million of capital expenditures, primarily for reliability of transmission and distribution systems. The $528 million does not include approximately $33 million
  spent on cost of removal. PSE&G’s projections for future capital expenditures include additions and replacements to its transmission and distribution systems to meet expected growth and to manage
  reliability. The current projections do not include investments required as a result of PJM’s approval of the Regional Transmission Expansion Plan (RTEP) in December 2006. As project scope and cost
  estimates develop, PSE&G will modify its current projections to include these required investments.

Power

In 2006, Power made approximately $325 million of capital expenditures (excluding $93 million for nuclear fuel), primarily related to installation of emissions control equipment at the Bridgeport
  Harbor and Mercer stations, completion of construction at the Linden station, in New Jersey and various other projects at Nuclear and Fossil. The projections above include estimates for Hudson and
  Mercer related to the agreement reached with the EPA and the NJDEP. They do not include the costs, if any, associated with cooling towers for Salem, if required. For additional discussion of the potential
  costs related Hudson, Mercer and Salem, see Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of Notes.

Energy Holdings

In 2006, Energy Holdings incurred approximately $64 million of capital expenditures, primarily related to upgrades and expansion of SAESA’s transmission and distribution systems.

Energy Holdings’ capital needs in 2007 will be limited to fulfilling existing contractual and potential contingent commitments. The balance of the forecasted expenditures relates to capital requirements
  of consolidated subsidiaries, which will primarily be financed from internally generated cash flow within the projects and from local sources on a non-recourse basis or limited discretionary investments by
  Energy Holdings. Such capital requirements include organic growth in SAESA’s service territory and other capital improvements at Global’s consolidated subsidiaries.


Disclosures about Long-Term Maturities, Contractual and Commercial Obligations and Certain Investments

The following table reflects PSEG’s and its subsidiaries’ contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments in the respective periods in which they are due. In addition, the table
  summarizes anticipated recourse and non-recourse debt maturities for the years shown. The table below does not reflect any anticipated cash payments for pension obligations. The table also does not
  reflect debt maturities of Energy Holdings’ non-consolidated investments. If those obligations were not able to be refinanced by the project, Energy Holdings may elect to make additional contributions in
  these investments. For additional information, see Note 10. Schedule of Consolidated Debt of the Notes.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Power

Power issues guarantees in conjunction with certain of its energy trading activities. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes for further discussion.

PSEG and Energy Holdings

Global has certain investments that are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Accordingly, amounts
  recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for such investments represent Global’s equity investment, which is increased for Global’s pro-rata share of earnings less any dividend distribution from such
  investments. The companies in which Global invests that are accounted for under the equity method have an aggregate $878 million of debt on their combined, consolidated financial statements. PSEG’s
  pro-rata share of such debt is $414 million. This debt is non-recourse to PSEG, Energy Holdings and Global. PSEG is generally not required to support the debt service obligations of these companies.
  However, default with respect to this non-recourse debt could result in a loss of invested equity.

Resources has investments in leveraged leases that are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases.” Leveraged lease investments generally involve three parties: an
  owner/lessor, a creditor and a lessee. In a typical leveraged lease financing, the lessor purchases an asset to be leased. The purchase price is typically financed 80% with debt provided by the creditor and the
  balance comes from equity funds provided by the lessor. The creditor provides long-term financing to the transaction secured by the property subject to the lease. Such long-term financing is non-recourse to
  the lessor and is not presented on Energy Holdings’ Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the event of default, the leased asset, and in some cases the lessee, secure the loan. As a lessor, Resources has ownership
  rights to the property and rents the property to the lessees for use in their business operation. As of December 31, 2006, Resources’ equity investment in leased assets was approximately $924 million, net of
  deferred taxes of approximately $1.9 billion. For additional information, see Note 8. Long-Term Investments of the Notes.

In the event that collectibility of the minimum lease payments to be received by the lessor is no longer reasonably assured, the accounting treatment for some of the leases may change. In such cases,
  Resources may deem that a lessee has a high probability of defaulting on the lease obligation, and would reclassify the lease from a leveraged lease to an operating lease and would consider the need to
  record an impairment of its investment. Should Resources ever directly assume a debt obligation, the fair value of the underlying asset and the associated debt would be recorded on the Consolidated
  Balance Sheets instead of the net equity investment in the lease.

Energy Holdings has guaranteed certain obligations of its subsidiaries or affiliates related to certain projects. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes for additional
  information.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

Under GAAP, many accounting standards require the use of estimates, variable inputs and assumptions (collectively referred to as estimates) that are subjective in nature. Because of this, differences
  between the actual measure realized versus the estimate can have a material impact on results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The managements of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy
  Holdings have each determined that the following estimates are considered critical to the application of rules that relate to their respective businesses.

Accounting for Pensions

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings account for pensions under SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” (SFAS 87). Pension costs under SFAS 87 are calculated using various
  economic and demographic assumptions. Economic assumptions include the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on trust assets. Demographic assumptions include projections of future mortality
  rates, pay increases and retirement patterns. In 2006, PSEG and its subsidiaries recorded pension expense of $97 million, compared to $109 million in 2005 and $102 million in 2004. Additionally, in 2006,
  PSEG and its respective


subsidiaries contributed cash of approximately $50 million, compared to cash contributions of $155 million in 2005 and $96 million in 2004.

PSEG’s discount rate assumption, which is determined annually, is based on the rates of return on high-quality fixed-income investments currently available and expected to be available during the
  period to maturity of the pension benefits. The discount rate used to calculate pension obligations is determined as of December 31 each year, PSEG’s SFAS 87 measurement date. The discount rate used to
  determine year-end obligations is also used to develop the following year’s net periodic pension cost. The discount rates used in PSEG’s 2005 and 2006 net periodic pension costs were 6.00% and 5.75%,
  respectively. PSEG’s 2007 net periodic pension cost was developed using a discount rate of 6.00%.

PSEG’s expected rate of return on plan assets reflects current asset allocations, historical long-term investment performance and an estimate of future long-term returns by asset class using input from
  PSEG’s actuary and investment advisors, as well as long-term inflation assumptions. For 2005 and 2006, PSEG assumed a rate of return of 8.75% on PSEG’s pension plan assets. For 2007, PSEG will
  continue the rate of return assumption of 8.75%.

Based on the above assumptions, PSEG has estimated net period pension costs of approximately $43 million and contributions of up to approximately $66 million in 2007. As part of the business
  planning process, PSEG has modeled its future costs assuming an 8.75% rate of return and a 6.0% discount rate for 2008 and beyond. Actual future pension expense and funding levels will depend on future
  investment performance, changes in discount rates, market conditions, funding levels relative to PSEG’s projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and various other factors
  related to the populations participating in PSEG’s pension plans.

The following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions. The effects of the assumption changes shown below solely reflect the impact of that specific
  assumption.

Accounting for Deferred Taxes

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings provide for income taxes based on the liability method required by SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (SFAS 109). Under this method, deferred
  tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
  basis, as well as net operating loss and credit carryforwards.

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against their respective deferred tax assets based on the likelihood of expected future taxable income. PSEG,
  PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings do not believe a valuation allowance is necessary; however, if the expected level of future taxable income changes or certain tax planning strategies become unavailable,
  PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings would record a valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period the valuation allowance is deemed necessary. Resources’ and Global’s ability to
  realize their deferred tax assets are dependent on PSEG’s subsidiaries’ ability to generate ordinary income and capital gains.

Hedge and Mark-to-Market (MTM) Accounting

SFAS 133 requires an entity to recognize the fair value of derivative instruments held as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. SFAS 133 applies to all derivative instruments held by PSEG, PSE&G,
  Power and Energy Holdings. The fair value of most derivative instruments is determined by reference to quoted market prices, listed contracts, or quotations from brokers. Some of these derivative
  contracts are long term and rely on forward price quotations over the entire duration of the derivative contracts.

In the absence of the pricing sources listed above, for a small number of contracts, PSEG and its subsidiary companies utilize mathematical models that rely on historical data to develop forward pricing
  information in the determination of fair value. Because the determination of fair value using such models is


subject to significant assumptions and estimates, PSEG and its subsidiary companies developed reserve policies that are consistently applied to model-generated results to determine reasonable estimates of
  value to record in the financial statements.

PSEG and its subsidiaries have entered into various derivative instruments in order to hedge exposure to commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. Many such instruments have
  been designated as cash flow hedges. For a cash flow hedge, the change in the value of a derivative instrument is measured against the offsetting change in the value of the underlying contract or business
  condition the derivative instrument is intended to hedge. This is known as the measure of derivative effectiveness. In accordance with SFAS 133, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of a
  derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, net of tax, or as a Regulatory Asset (Liability). Amounts in Accumulated Other
  Comprehensive Loss are ultimately recognized in earnings when the related hedged forecasted transaction occurs. During periods of extreme price volatility, there will be significant changes in the value
  recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. The changes in the fair value of the ineffective portions of derivative instrument designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in earnings.

For Power’s and Holdings’ wholesale energy businesses, many of the forward sale, forward purchase and other option contracts are derivative instruments that hedge commodity price risk, but for which
  the businesses are not able to apply the hedge accounting guidance in SFAS 133. The changes in value of such derivative contracts are marked to market through earnings as commodity prices fluctuate. As
  a result, the earnings of PSEG, Power and Holdings may experience significant fluctuations depending on the volatility of commodity prices.

For Power’s energy trading activities, all changes in the fair value of energy trading derivative contracts are recorded in earnings.

For additional information regarding Derivative Financial Instruments, see Note 11. Financial Risk Management Activities of the Notes.

PSE&G

Unbilled Revenues

Electric and gas revenues are recorded based on services rendered to customers during each accounting period. PSE&G records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount customers will be billed for
  services rendered from the time meters were last read to the end of the respective accounting period. Unbilled usage is calculated in two steps. The initial step is to apply a base usage per day to the number
  of unbilled days in the period. The second step estimates seasonal loads based upon the time of year and the variance of actual degree-days and temperature-humidity-index hours of the unbilled period
  from expected norms. The resulting usage is priced at current rate levels and recorded as revenue. A calculation of the associated energy cost for the unbilled usage is recorded as well. Each month the prior
  month’s unbilled amounts are reversed and the current month’s amounts are accrued. Using benchmarks other than those used in this calculation could have a material effect on the amounts accrued in a
  reporting period. The resulting revenue and expense reflect the service rendered in the calendar month.

PSE&G

SFAS No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation” (SFAS 71)

PSE&G prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 71, which differs in certain respects from the application of GAAP by non-regulated businesses. In
  general, SFAS 71 recognizes that accounting for rate-regulated enterprises should reflect the economic effects of regulation. As a result, a regulated utility is required to defer the recognition of costs (a
  regulatory asset) or recognize obligations (a regulatory liability) if it is probable that, through the rate-making process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future rates. Accordingly, PSE&G
  has deferred certain costs, which will be amortized over various future periods. To the extent that collection of such costs or payment of liabilities is no longer probable as a result of changes in regulation
  and/or PSE&G’s competitive position, the associated regulatory asset or liability is charged or credited to income. See Note 5. Regulatory Matters of the Notes for additional information related to these and
  other regulatory issues.


Power

NDT Funds

Power accounts for the assets in the NDT Funds under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (SFAS 115). The assets in the NDT Funds are classified as
  available-for-sale securities and are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss unless securities with such unrealized losses are deemed to be
  other-than-temporarily-impaired. Realized gains, losses and dividend and interest income are recorded on Power’s and PSEG’s Statements of Operations under Other Income and Other Deductions.
  Unrealized losses that are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired, as defined under SFAS 115, and related interpretive guidance, are charged against earnings rather than Accumulated Other
  Comprehensive Loss.

Power and Energy Holdings

Accounting for Goodwill

Power and Energy Holdings evaluate their respective goodwill for impairment at least annually or when indications of impairment exist. An impairment may exist when the carrying amount of goodwill
  exceeds its implied fair value.

Accounting estimates related to goodwill fair value are highly susceptible to change from period to period because they require management to make cash flow assumptions about future sales, operating
  costs, economic conditions and discount rates over an indefinite life. The impact of recognizing an impairment could have a material impact on financial position and results of operations.

Power and Energy Holdings perform annual goodwill impairment tests and continuously monitor the business environment in which they operate for any impairment issues that may arise. As indicated
  above, certain assumptions are used to arrive at a fair value for goodwill testing. Such assumptions are consistently employed and include, but are not limited to, free cash flow projections, interest rates,
  tariff adjustments, economic conditions prevalent in the geographic regions in which Power and Energy Holdings do business, local spot market prices for energy, foreign exchange rates and the credit
  worthiness of customers. If an adverse event were to occur, such an event could materially change the assumptions used to value goodwill and could result in impairments of goodwill.

PSEG and Energy Holdings

Foreign Currency Translation

Energy Holdings’ financial statements are prepared using the U.S. Dollar as the reporting currency. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”, for foreign operations whose
  functional currency is deemed to be the local (foreign) currency, asset and liability accounts are translated into U.S. Dollars at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average
  exchange rates prevailing during the period. Translation gains and losses (net of applicable deferred taxes) are not included in determining Net Income but are reported in Other Comprehensive Income.
  Gains and losses on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred.

The determination of an entity’s functional currency requires management’s judgment. It is based on an assessment of the primary currency in which transactions in the local environment are
  conducted, and whether the local currency can be relied upon as a stable currency in which to conduct business. As economic and business conditions change, Energy Holdings is required to reassess the
  economic environment and determine the appropriate functional currency. The impact of foreign currency accounting could have a material adverse impact on Energy Holdings’ results of operations.


ITEM 7A.

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

The market risk inherent in PSEG’s, PSE&G’s, Power’s and Energy Holdings’ market-risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency
  exchange rates, commodity prices, equity security prices and interest rates as discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes). It is the policy of each entity to use derivatives to manage
  risk consistent with its respective business plans and prudent practices. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings have a Risk Management Committee (RMC) comprised of executive officers who utilize
  an independent risk oversight function to ensure compliance with corporate policies and prudent risk management practices.

Additionally, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are exposed to counterparty credit losses in the event of non-performance or non-payment. PSEG has a credit management process, which is
  used to assess, monitor and mitigate counterparty exposure for PSEG and its subsidiaries. In the event of non- performance or non-payment by a major counterparty, there may be a material adverse impact
  on PSEG and its subsidiaries’ financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

Energy Holdings

Global is exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risk that arise from investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Primarily, Global is impacted by changes in the U.S. Dollar
  to Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the Chilean Peso exchange rates and to a much lesser extent, the Euro. Whenever possible, these subsidiaries and affiliates have attempted to limit potential foreign exchange
  impacts by entering into revenue contracts that adjust to changes in foreign exchange rates. Global also uses foreign currency forward, swap and option agreements to manage risk related to certain foreign
  currency transactions, when appropriate.

Global’s investment balances are also impacted by foreign currency changes through translation adjustments. Foreign currency has strengthened on a net basis since Global’s acquisitions and
  investments in Chile and Peru. A foreign currency fluctuation of 10% in such foreign currencies would result in an aggregate change in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income of $92 million. As of
  December 31, 2006, Energy Holdings’ net gain in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income from currency fluctuations was approximately $111 million.

Commodity Contracts

PSEG and Power

The availability and price of energy commodities are subject to fluctuations from factors such as weather, environmental policies, changes in supply and demand, state and federal regulatory policies,
  market rules and other events. To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, Power enters into supply contracts and derivative contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps and options with approved
  counterparties. These contracts, in conjunction with demand obligations help reduce risk and optimize the value of owned electric generation capacity.

Normal Operations and Hedging Activities

Power enters into physical contracts, as well as financial contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps and options designed to reduce risk associated with volatile commodity prices. Commodity price
  risk is associated with market price movements resulting from market generation demand, changes in fuel costs and various other factors.

Under SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedge transactions are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, and gains and losses are recognized in earnings when the
  underlying transaction occurs. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that do not meet hedge criteria under SFAS 133 and the ineffective portion of hedge contracts are recognized in earnings
  currently. Additionally, changes in the fair value attributable to fair value hedges are similarly recognized in earnings.


Many non-trading contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exemption under SFAS 133 and are accounted for upon settlement.

Trading

Power maintains a strategy of entering into trading positions to optimize the value of its portfolio of generation assets, gas supply contracts and its electric and gas supply obligations. Power engages in
  physical and financial transactions in the electricity wholesale markets and executes an overall risk management strategy to mitigate the effects of adverse movements in the fuel and electricity markets. In
  addition, Power has non-asset based trading activities, which have significantly decreased. These contracts also involve financial transactions including swaps, options and futures. These activities are marked
  to market in accordance with SFAS 133 with gains and losses recognized in earnings.

Value-at-Risk (VaR) Models

Power

Power uses VaR models to assess the market risk of its commodity businesses. The portfolio VaR model for Power includes its owned generation and physical contracts, as well as fixed price sales
  requirements, load requirements and financial derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential gains or losses, under normal market conditions, for instruments or portfolios due to changes in market
  factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. Power estimates VaR across its commodity businesses.

Power manages its exposure at the portfolio level. Its portfolio consists of owned generation, load-serving contracts (both gas and electric), fuel supply contracts and energy derivatives designed to
  manage the risk around generation and load. While Power manages its risk at the portfolio level, it also monitors separately the risk of its trading activities and its hedges. Non-trading MTM VaR consists of
  MTM derivatives that are economic hedges, some of which qualify for hedge accounting. The MTM derivatives that are not hedges are included in the trading VaR.

The VaR models used by Power are variance/covariance models adjusted for the delta of positions with a 95% one-tailed confidence level and a one-day holding period for the MTM trading and non-
  trading activities and a 95% one-tailed confidence level with a one-week holding period for the portfolio VaR. The models assume no new positions throughout the holding periods, whereas Power actively
  manages its portfolio.

Reduced trading activities by Power during 2006 have resulted in less trading risk. As of December 31, 2006, trading VaR was immaterial. As of December 31, 2005, trading VaR was approximately $1
  million.

Interest Rates

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. It is the policy of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings to manage
  interest


rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt, interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings manage their respective interest rate exposures by
  maintaining a targeted ratio of fixed and floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10% change in market interest rates would result in a $7 million, $3 million, $1 million and an
  insignificant change (less than $500 thousand) in annual interest costs related to debt at PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10%
  change in market interest rates would result in a $7 million, $77 million, $105 million and $32 million change in the fair value of the debt of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, respectively.

Debt and Equity Securities

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

PSEG has approximately $3.4 billion invested in its pension plans. Although fluctuations in market prices of securities within this portfolio do not directly affect PSEG’s earnings in the current period,
  changes in the value of these investments could affect PSEG’s future contributions to these plans, its financial position if its ABO under its pension plans exceeds the fair value of its pension funds and
  future earnings as PSEG could be required to adjust pension expense and its assumed rate of return.

Power

Power’s NDT Funds are comprised of both fixed income and equity securities totaling $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2006. The fair value of equity securities is determined independently each month
  by the Trustee. As of December 31, 2006, the portfolio was comprised of approximately $785 million of equity securities and approximately $471 million in fixed income securities. The fair market value of
  the assets in the NDT Funds will fluctuate primarily depending upon the performance of equity markets. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10% change in the equity market would impact the value
  of the equity securities in the NDT Funds by approximately $79 million.

Power uses duration to measure the interest rate sensitivity of the fixed income portfolio. Duration is a summary statistic of the effective average maturity of the fixed income portfolio. The benchmark
  for the fixed income component of the NDT Funds is the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which currently has duration of 4.46 years and a yield of 5.34%. The portfolio’s value will appreciate or
  depreciate by the duration with a 1% change in interest rates. As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would result in a decline in the market value for the fixed income
  portfolio of approximately $7.8 million.

Credit Risk

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings would incur as a result of non-performance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations.
  PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings have established credit policies that they believe significantly minimize credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of potential counterparties’ financial
  condition (including credit rating), collateral requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements, which may allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated
  with a single counterparty.

PSE&G

BGS suppliers expose PSE&G to credit losses in the event of non-performance or non-payment upon a default of the BGS supplier. Credit requirements are governed under BPU approved BGS
  contracts.

Power

Counterparties expose Power’s trading operation to credit losses in the event of non-performance or non-payment. Power has a credit management process, which is used to assess, monitor and mitigate
  counterparty exposure for Power and its subsidiaries. Power’s counterparty credit limits are based on a


scoring model that considers a variety of factors, including leverage, liquidity, profitability, credit ratings and risk management capabilities. Power’s trading operations have entered into payment netting
  agreements or enabling agreements that allow for payment netting with the majority of its large counterparties, which reduce Power’s exposure to counterparty risk by providing the offset of amounts
  payable to the counterparty against amounts receivable from the counterparty. In the event of non-performance or non-payment by a major counterparty, there may be a material adverse impact on Power’s
  and its subsidiaries’ financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 97% of the credit exposure (MTM plus net receivables and payables, less cash
  collateral) for Power’s trading operations was with investment grade counterparties. The majority of the credit exposure with non-investment grade counterparties was with certain companies that supply
  fuel (primarily coal) to Power. Therefore, this exposure relates to the risk of a counterparty performing under its obligations rather than payment risk. As of December 31, 2006, Power’s trading operations
  had over 121 active counterparties.

Energy Holdings

Global

Global has credit risk with respect to its counterparties to power purchase agreements (PPAs) and other parties.

Resources

As of December 31, 2006, Resources has a remaining gross investment in three leased aircraft of approximately $41 million, all with Northwest airlines. Resources successfully restructured the leases
  and converted them from leveraged leases to operating leases. Energy Holdings expects to recover its investment through cash flows from the operating leases.

Resources has credit risk related to its investments in leveraged leases, totaling $924 million, which is net of deferred taxes of $1.9 billion, as of December 31, 2006. These investments are largely
  concentrated in the energy industry. As of December 31, 2006, 67% of counterparties in the lease portfolio were rated investment grade by both S&P and Moody’s. As of December 31, 2006, the weighted
  average credit rating of the lessees in Resources’ leasing portfolio was A–/A3 by S&P and Moody’s respectively.

Resources is the lessor of domestic generating facilities in several U.S. energy markets. Several of these lessees have credit ratings below investment grade. Resources’ investment in such transactions
  was approximately $264 million, net of deferred taxes of $510 million as of December 31, 2006. The credit exposure to the lessees is partially mitigated through various credit enhancement mechanisms
  within the lease transactions. These credit enhancement features vary from lease to lease. Some of the leasing transactions include covenants that restrict the flow of dividends from the lessee to its parent,
  over-collateralization of the lessee with non-leased assets, historical and forward cash flow coverage tests that prohibit discretionary capital expenditures and dividend payments to the parent/lessee if stated
  minimum coverages are not met and similar cash flow restrictions if ratings are not maintained at stated levels. These covenants are designed to maintain cash reserves in the transaction entity for the
  benefit of the non-recourse lenders and the lessor/equity participants in the event of a market downturn or degradation in operating performance of the leased assets.

In any lease transaction, in the event of a default, Energy Holdings would exercise its rights and attempt to seek recovery of its investment. The results of such efforts may not be known for a period of
  time. A bankruptcy of a lessee and failure to recover adequate value could lead to a foreclosure of the lease. Under a worst-case scenario, if a foreclosure were to occur, Resources would record a pre-tax
  write-off up to its gross investment, including deferred taxes, in these facilities. Also, in the event of a potential foreclosure, the net tax benefits generated by Resources’ portfolio of investments could be
  materially reduced in the period in which gains associated with the potential forgiveness of debt at these projects occurs. The amount and timing of any potential reduction in net tax benefits is dependent
  upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the time of a potential foreclosure, the amount of lease debt outstanding, any cash trapped at the projects and negotiations during such potential
  foreclosure process. The potential loss of earnings, impairment and/or tax payments could have a material impact to PSEG’s and Energy Holdings’ financial position, results of operations and net cash flows.


Other Supplemental Information Regarding Market Risk

Power

The following table describes the drivers of Power’s energy trading and marketing activities and Operating Revenues included in its Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December
  31, 2006. Normal operations and hedging activities represent the marketing of electricity available from Power’s owned or contracted generation sold into the wholesale market. As the information in this
  table highlights, MTM activities represent a small portion of the total Operating Revenues for Power. Activities accounted for under the accrual method, including normal purchases and sales, account for
  the majority of the revenue. The MTM activities reported here are those relating to changes in fair value due to external movement in prices. For additional information, see Note 11. Financial Risk

Wherever possible, fair values for these contracts were obtained from quoted market sources. For contracts where no quoted market exists, modeling techniques were employed using assumptions
  reflective of current market rates, yield curves and forward prices as applicable to interpolate certain prices. The effect of using such modeling techniques is not material to Power’s financial results.

PSEG, Power and Energy Holdings

The following table identifies losses on cash flow hedges that are currently in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, a separate component of equity. Power uses forward sale and purchase contracts,
  swaps and firm transmission rights contracts to hedge forecasted energy sales from its generation stations and its contracted supply obligations. Power also enters into swaps, options and futures transactions
  to hedge the price of fuel to meet its fuel purchase requirements for generation. PSEG, Power and Energy Holdings are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business.
  PSEG’s policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives. The table also provides an estimate of the losses, net of taxes that are
  expected to be reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and into earnings over the next twelve months.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Sole Member and Board of Directors of

PSEG E

NERGY

H

OLDINGS

L.L.C.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PSEG Energy Holdings L.L.C. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
  statements of operations, member’s equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule listed in
  the Index at Item 15. These consolidated financial statements and the consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
  opinion on the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
  reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
  financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose
  of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
  supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
  statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of its operations
  and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such
  consolidated financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information set forth
  therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization

Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG)

PSEG has four principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries: Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G), PSEG Power LLC (Power), PSEG Energy Holdings L.L.C. (Energy Holdings) and PSEG
  Services Corporation (Services).

As previously disclosed, on December 20, 2004, PSEG entered into an agreement and plan of merger (Merger Agreement) with Exelon Corporation (Exelon), a public utility holding company
  headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, providing for a merger of PSEG with and into Exelon. On September 14, 2006, PSEG received from Exelon a formal notice of termination of the Merger under the
  provisions of the Merger Agreement.

PSE&G

PSE&G is an operating public utility engaged principally in the transmission of electric energy and distribution of electric energy and natural gas in certain areas of New Jersey. PSE&G is subject to
  regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

PSE&G also owns PSE&G Transition Funding LLC (Transition Funding) and PSE&G Transition Funding II LLC (Transition Funding II), bankruptcy-remote entities that purchased certain transition
  property from PSE&G and issued transition bonds secured by such property. The transition property consists principally of the rights to receive electricity consumption-based per kilowatt-hour (kWh) charges
  from PSE&G electric distribution customers, which represent irrevocable rights to receive amounts sufficient to recover certain of PSE&G’s transition costs related to deregulation, as approved by the BPU.

Power

Power is a multi-regional, wholesale energy supply company that integrates its generating asset operations and gas supply commitments with its wholesale energy, fuel supply, energy trading and
  marketing and risk management function through three principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries: PSEG Nuclear LLC (Nuclear), PSEG Fossil LLC (Fossil) and PSEG Energy Resources & Trade LLC
  (ER&T). Nuclear and Fossil own and operate generation and generation-related facilities. ER&T is responsible for the day-to-day management of Power’s portfolio. Fossil, Nuclear and ER&T are subject to
  regulation by FERC and Nuclear is also subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

Energy Holdings

Energy Holdings has two principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries: PSEG Global L.L.C. (Global), which owns and operates international and domestic projects engaged in the generation and
  distribution of energy and PSEG Resources L.L.C. (Resources), which has invested primarily in energy-related leveraged leases. Energy Holdings also owns Enterprise Group Development Corporation
  (EGDC), a commercial real estate property management business.

Services

Services provides management and administrative and general services to PSEG and its subsidiaries. These include accounting, treasury, financial risk management, law, tax communications, planning,
  development, human resources, corporate secretarial, information technology, investor relations, stockholder services, real estate, insurance, library, records and information services, security and certain
  other services. Services charges PSEG and its subsidiaries for the cost of work performed and services provided pursuant to the terms and conditions of intercompany service agreements.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Principles of Consolidation

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

PSEG’s, PSE&G’s, Power’s and Energy Holdings’ consolidated financial statements include their respective accounts and consolidate those entities in which they have a controlling interest or are the
  primary beneficiary, except for certain of PSEG’s capital trusts which were deconsolidated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 46 (revised December
  2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (VIE)” (FIN 46). Entities over which PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings exhibit significant influence, but do not have a controlling interest and/or
  are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For investments in which significant influence does not exist and the investor is not the primary beneficiary, the
  cost method of accounting is applied. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

PSE&G and Power

PSE&G and Power each have undivided interests in certain jointly-owned facilities and each is responsible for paying their respective ownership share of additional construction costs, fuel inventory
  purchases and operating expenses. All revenues and expenses related to these facilities are consolidated at their respective pro-rata ownership share in the appropriate revenue and expense categories on the
  Consolidated Statements of Operations. For additional information regarding these jointly-owned facilities, see Note 19. Property, Plant and Equipment and Jointly-Owned Facilities of the Notes.

Accounting for the Effects of Regulation

PSE&G

PSE&G prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation”
  (SFAS 71). In general, SFAS 71 recognizes that accounting for rate-regulated enterprises should reflect the economic effects of regulation. As a result, a regulated utility is required to defer the recognition
  of costs (a regulatory asset) or record the recognition of obligations (a regulatory liability) if it is probable that, through the rate-making process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future
  rates. Accordingly, PSE&G has deferred certain costs and recoveries, which are being amortized over various future periods. To the extent that collection of any such costs or payment of liabilities is no
  longer probable as a result of changes in regulation and/or PSE&G’s competitive position, the associated regulatory asset or liability is charged or credited to income. Management believes that PSE&G’s
  transmission and distribution businesses continue to meet the requirements for application of SFAS 71. For additional information, see Note 5. Regulatory Matters of the Notes.

Derivative Financial Instruments

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings use derivative financial instruments to manage risk from changes in interest rates, congestion credits, emission credits, commodity prices and foreign currency
  exchange rates, pursuant to their business plans and prudent practices.

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings recognize derivative instruments on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as, and that is
  designated and qualifies as, a fair value hedge (including foreign currency fair value hedges), along with changes of the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk, are
  recorded in current-period earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as, and that is designated and qualifies as, a cash flow hedge (including foreign currency cash flow
  hedges) are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income / Loss until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. Any hedge ineffectiveness is included in
  current-period earnings. In certain circumstances, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and/or Energy Holdings enter into derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedges


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

or choose not to designate them as normal purchases or sales or as fair value or cash flow hedges; in such cases, changes in fair value are recorded in current-period earnings.

Many non-trading contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exemption under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended and
  interpreted (SFAS 133) and are accounted for upon settlement.

For additional information regarding derivative financial instruments, see Note 11. Financial Risk Management Activities of the Notes.

Revenue Recognition

PSE&G

PSE&G’s Operating Revenues are recorded based on services rendered to customers during each accounting period. PSE&G records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount customers will be billed
  for services rendered from the time meters were last read to the end of the respective accounting period. The unbilled revenue is estimated each month based on usage per day, the number of unbilled days
  in the period, estimated seasonal loads based upon the time of year and the variance of actual degree-days and temperature-humidity-index hours of the unbilled period from expected norms.

Power

The majority of Power’s revenues relate to bilateral contracts, which are accounted for on the accrual basis as the energy is delivered. Power’s revenue also includes changes in value of non trading
  energy derivative contracts that are not designated as normal purchases or sales or as hedges of other positions. Power records margins from energy trading on a net basis pursuant to accounting principles
  generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). See Note 11. Financial Risk Management Activities for further discussion.

Energy Holdings

Certain of Global’s investments are majority owned, controlled and consolidated. Global records revenues from its consolidated investments in generation and distribution facilities based on services
  rendered to customers during each accounting period. Revenues from these projects are included in Operating Revenues. Global’s Operating Revenue also includes changes in value of non trading energy
  derivative contracts that are not designated as normal purchases or sales or as hedges of other positions and includes margins from energy trading recorded on a net basis pursuant to GAAP. See Note 11.
  Financial Risk Management Activities for further discussion. Other investments are less than majority owned and are accounted for under the equity or cost methods as appropriate. Income from these
  investments is recorded as a component of Operating Income. Gains or losses incurred as a result of exiting one of these businesses are typically recorded as a component of Operating Income.

The majority of Resources’ revenues relates to its investments in leveraged leases and is accounted for under SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases” (SFAS 13). Income on leveraged leases is
  recognized by a method which produces a constant rate of return on the outstanding net investment in the lease, net of the related deferred tax liability, in the years in which the net investment is positive.
  Any gains or losses incurred as a result of a lease termination are recorded as revenues as these events occur in the ordinary course of business of managing the investment portfolio. See Note 8. Long-Term
  Investments for further discussion.

Depreciation and Amortization

PSE&G

PSE&G calculates depreciation under the straight-line method based on estimated average remaining lives of the several classes of depreciable property. These estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis
  and necessary adjustments are made as approved by the BPU. The depreciation rate stated as a percentage of original cost of depreciable property was 2.84% for 2006, 3.00% for 2005 and 3.07% for 2004.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Power

Power calculates depreciation on generation-related assets under the straight-line method based on the assets’ estimated useful lives which are determined based on planned operations. The estimated
  useful lives are from three years to 20 years for general plant assets. The estimated useful lives are 30 years to 55 years for fossil production assets, 49 years to 56 years for nuclear generation assets and 45
  years for pumped storage facilities. As of January 1, 2007 the company changed certain of the estimated useful lives for certain fossil production assets to 67 years, for pumped storage assets to 76 years and
  for nuclear generation assets to 58 years.

Energy Holdings

Energy Holdings calculates depreciation on property, plant and equipment under the straight-line method with estimated useful lives ranging from three years to 40 years.

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes

PSE&G

Excise taxes, transitional energy facilities assessment (TEFA) and gross receipts tax (GRT) collected from PSE&G’s customers are presented on the financial statements on a gross basis. As a result of
  New Jersey energy tax reform, effective January 1, 1998, TEFA and GRT are the residual of the prior excise tax, the New Jersey gross receipts and franchise taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2006,
  2005 and 2004, combined TEFA and GRT of approximately $146 million, $155 million and $153 million, respectively, are reflected in Operating Revenues and $132 million, $141 million and $139 million,
  respectively, are included in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) and Interest Capitalized During Construction (IDC)

PSE&G

AFUDC represents the cost of debt and equity funds used to finance the construction of new utility assets under the guidance of SFAS 71. The amount of AFUDC capitalized is reported in the
  Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of interest charges. PSE&G’s average rate used for calculating AFUDC in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 4.99%, 3.17% and 1.33%, respectively. For the years
  ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, PSE&G’s AFUDC amounted to $2.0 million, $1.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively.

Power and Energy Holdings

IDC represents the cost of debt used to finance construction at Power and Energy Holdings. The amount of IDC capitalized is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of
  interest charges and is included in Property, Plant and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Power’s average rate used for calculating IDC in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 6.81%, 6.74% and 6.81%,
  respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, Power’s IDC amounted to $41 million, $95 million and $107 million, respectively. Energy Holdings’ average rate used for calculating
  IDC in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 6.72%, 7.81% and 8.37%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, Energy Holdings’ IDC amounted to approximately $1 million, $3 million and
  $4 million, respectively.

Income Taxes

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

PSEG and its subsidiaries file a consolidated Federal income tax return and income taxes are allocated to PSEG’s subsidiaries based on the taxable income or loss of each subsidiary. Investment tax
  credits were deferred in prior years and are being amortized over the useful lives of the related property.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Foreign Currency Translation/Transactions

Energy Holdings

A business’ functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the business operates and is generally the currency in which the business generates and expends cash. In
  accordance with SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation,” the assets and liabilities of foreign operations of Energy Holdings, with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar, are translated into
  U.S. Dollars at the current exchange rates in effect at the end of the reporting period. The translation differences that result from this process, and gains and losses on intercompany foreign currency
  transactions, which are long-term in nature and that Energy Holdings does not intend to settle in the foreseeable future, are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss as a separate component of
  member’s equity. U.S. deferred taxes are not provided on translation gains and losses where Energy Holdings expects earnings of a foreign operation to be permanently reinvested. The revenue and expense
  accounts of such foreign operations are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rates that prevail during the period.

Gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in Other Income or
  Other Deductions. Gains and losses relating to derivatives designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in foreign operations are reported in Currency Translation Adjustment,
  a separate component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss.

The determination of an entity’s functional currency requires management’s judgment. It is based on an assessment of the primary currency in which transactions in the local environment are
  conducted, and whether the local currency can be relied upon as a stable currency in which to conduct business. As economic and business conditions change, Energy Holdings is required to reassess the
  economic environment and determine the appropriate functional currency. The impact of foreign currency accounting could have a material effect on Energy Holdings’ financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of working funds and highly liquid marketable securities (commercial paper and money market funds) with an original maturity of three months or less.

Materials and Supplies and Fuel

PSE&G

PSE&G’s materials and supplies are carried at average cost consistent with the rate-making process.

Power and Energy Holdings

Materials and supplies and fuel for Power and Energy Holdings are valued at the lower of average cost or market.

Property, Plant and Equipment

PSE&G

PSE&G’s additions and replacements to property, plant and equipment that are either retirement units or property record units are capitalized at original cost. The cost of maintenance, repair and
  replacement of minor items of property is charged to appropriate expense accounts as incurred. At the time units of depreciable property are retired or otherwise disposed of, the original cost, adjusted for
  net salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Power and Energy Holdings

Power and Energy Holdings only capitalize costs which increase the capacity or extend the life of an existing asset, represent a newly acquired or constructed asset or represent the replacement of a
  retired asset. The cost of maintenance, repair and replacement of minor items of property is charged to appropriate expense accounts as incurred. Environmental costs are capitalized if the costs mitigate or
  prevent future environmental contamination or if the costs improve existing assets’ environmental safety or efficiency. All other environmental expenditures are expensed as incurred. Certain subsidiaries of
  Energy Holdings that are in the distribution business capitalize all incremental costs associated with construction activities. These construction costs meet the capitalization criteria described above.

Other Special Funds

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

Other Special Funds represents amounts deposited to fund the qualified pension plans and to fund a Rabbi Trust which was established to meet the obligations related to three non-qualified pension
  plans and a deferred compensation plan.

Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) Funds

Power

As required under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (SFAS 115), realized gains and losses on securities in the NDT Funds are recorded in earnings
  and unrealized gains and losses on such securities are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss unless securities with such unrealized losses are deemed to be other-than-
  temporarily-impaired. See Note 3. Asset Retirement Obligations for a discussion of SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (SFAS 143) and the impact of its adoption on the nuclear
  decommissioning liability and associated asset retirement costs related to the NDT Funds.

Investments in Corporate Joint Ventures and Partnerships

Energy Holdings

Generally, Global’s interests in active joint ventures and partnerships are accounted for under the equity method of accounting where its respective ownership interests are 50% or less, it is not the
  primary beneficiary, as defined under FIN 46, and significant influence over joint venture or partnership operating and management decisions exists. For investments in which significant influence does not
  exist and Global is not the primary beneficiary, the cost method of accounting is applied.

Deferred Project Costs and Development Costs

Power

Power capitalizes all incremental and direct external and direct internal costs related to project development once a project reaches certain milestones. On Power’s Consolidated Balance Sheets,
  deferred project costs are recorded in Construction Work in Progress. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related project assets. Such amortization commences upon the
  date of commercial operation. Development costs related to unsuccessful projects are charged to expense.

Basis Adjustment

PSE&G and Power

PSE&G and Power have recorded a Basis Adjustment on their Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the generation assets that were transferred from PSE&G to Power in August 2000 at the price
  specified by the BPU. Because the transfer was between affiliates, PSE&G and Power, the transaction was recorded at the net book value of the assets and liabilities rather than the transfer price. The
  difference between the total


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

transfer price and the net book value of the generation-related assets and liabilities, approximately $986 million, net of tax, was recorded as a Basis Adjustment on PSE&G’s and Power’s Consolidated
  Balance Sheets. The $986 million is a reduction of Power’s Member’s Equity and an addition to PSE&G’s Common Stockholder’s Equity. These amounts are eliminated on PSEG’s consolidated financial
  statements.

Use of Estimates

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding certain types of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Such estimates
  primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, upon settlement, actual results may materially differ from estimated amounts.

Reclassifications

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. The reclassifications relate primarily to recording revenue and related
  expenses on certain transactions on a net basis versus gross.

During the fourth quarter of 2006, based upon the provisions of EITF 99-19, “Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent”, PSE&G determined that the revenues and expenses
  related to one of its contracts that had been recorded on a gross basis would more appropriately be recorded on a net basis in Operating Revenues. Therefore, prior year amounts have been reclassified
  resulting in a reduction of $214 million and $162 million in both Operating Revenues and Energy Costs for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, for PSEG and PSE&G, with no impact
  on Operating Income.

Note 2. Recent Accounting Standards

The following accounting standards were issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), or the SEC but have not yet been adopted by PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings.

SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (SFAS 159)

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, which permits entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair
  value. An entity would report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The objective is to improve financial
  reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting
  provisions. The decision about whether to elect the fair value option is applied instrument by instrument, with a few exceptions; the decision is irrevocable; and it is applied only to entire instruments and
  not to portions of instruments.

The statement requires disclosures that facilitate comparisons (a) between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities and (b) between assets and liabilities in
  the financial statements of an entity that selects different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities.

SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year provided the entity also elects to
  apply the provisions of SFAS 157. Upon implementation, an entity shall report the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of Retained
  Earnings. Since the provisions of SFAS 159 are applied prospectively, any potential impact will depend on the instruments selected for fair value measurement at the time of implementation.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157)

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, which provides a single definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
  Prior to SFAS 157, guidance for applying fair value was incorporated into several accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific
  measurement, and sets out a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and those based on an entity’s own
  assumptions (unobservable inputs). Under SFAS 157, fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy, with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets. While this
  statement does not require any new fair value measurements, the application of this statement will change current practice for some fair value measurements.

This statement also nullifies the guidance in footnote 3 of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-3, “Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts
  Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities.” The guidance in footnote 3 applied for derivatives (and other) instruments measured at fair value at initial recognition under SFAS 133,
  “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” That guidance precluded immediate recognition in earnings of an unrealized gain or loss, measured as the difference between the
  transaction price and the fair value of the instrument at initial recognition, if the fair value of the instrument was determined using significant unobservable inputs. Under this guidance, an entity could not
  recognize an unrealized gain or loss at inception of a derivative instrument unless the fair value of that instrument was obtained from a quoted market price in an active market or was otherwise evidenced
  by comparison to other observable current market transaction or based on a valuation technique incorporating observable market data. At December 31, 2006, Energy Holdings has a deferred inception loss
  of approximately $45 million, which was being amortized at $11 million pre-tax per year through 2010.

SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007; however, earlier application is encouraged. PSEG early adopted this statement effective January
  1, 2007. Early adoption resulted in recording the remaining Energy Holdings deferred inception loss in Retained Earnings and eliminating any future amortization of the loss.

FIN 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109” (FIN 48)

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which prescribes a model for how a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company
  has taken or expects to take on a tax return. Under FIN 48, the financial statements will reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the tax authorities’ full knowledge of the
  position and all relevant facts. FIN 48 permits recognition of the benefit of tax positions only when it is “more likely-than-not” that the position is sustainable based on the merits of the position. It further
  limits the amount of tax benefit to be recognized to the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. FIN 48 also requires explicit disclosures about uncertainties in income tax
  positions, including a detailed roll-forward of unrecognized tax benefits taken that do not qualify for financial statement recognition.

FIN 48 is effective as of the beginning of fiscal years that start after December 15, 2006. In general, companies will record the change in net assets that result from the application of FIN 48 as an
  adjustment to Retained Earnings. However, for PSE&G, because any charges to income arising from the adoption of FIN 48 would be recoverable in future rates, the offset to any incremental PSE&G liability
  would be recorded as a Regulatory Asset rather than Retained Earnings. The following table presents the estimated ranges of impact on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for PSEG and its subsidiaries as a
  result of implementing FIN 48:

FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 13-2, “Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction” (FSP 13-2)

PSEG and Energy Holdings

In July 2006, the FASB issued FSP 13-2, which addresses how a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction affects the
  accounting by a lessor for that lease. The FSP amends SFAS 13, “Accounting for Leases,” stating that a change in the timing of the above referenced cash flows must be reviewed at least annually or more
  frequently, if events or circumstances indicate a change in timing is probable. If a change in timing has occurred, or is projected to occur, the rate of return and the allocation of income to positive
  investment years must be recalculated from the inception of the lease.

The guidance in this FSP is to be applied to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this FSP is to be reported as an adjustment to the
  beginning balance of Retained Earnings as of the beginning of the period in which this FSP is adopted. As a result of implementing FSP 13-2, upon adoption PSEG and Energy Holdings estimate that they
  will each recognize on their Balance Sheets a reduction in their Investment in Leveraged Leases of approximately $70 million with an offsetting reduction in Retained Earnings.

The following new accounting standards were adopted by PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings during 2006.

SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment, revised 2004” (SFAS 123R)

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

Effective January 1, 2006, PSEG adopted SFAS 123R, which replaces SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS 123) and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB)
  Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (APB 25). SFAS 123R focuses primarily on accounting for share-based awards to employees in exchange for services, and it requires entities to
  recognize compensation expense for these awards. The cost for equity-based awards is expensed over the requisite service period based on their grant date fair value, and liability awards are expensed based
  on their fair value, which is re-measured each reporting period. The pro forma disclosure previously permitted under SFAS 123 is no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition.

Prior to January 1, 2006, PSEG accounted for stock-based awards under the intrinsic value method of APB 25. In accordance with APB 25, PSEG did not record compensation expense related to its
  stock option grants because the strike price was equal to the fair value of the underlying stock on the grant date; however, it did record compensation expense over the requisite service period for restricted
  stock grants and performance unit awards.

SFAS 123R is applicable to all of PSEG’s outstanding unvested share-based payment awards as of January 1, 2006 and all prospective awards using the modified prospective method. Accordingly, the
  financial results for prior periods were not retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of SFAS 123R. The compensation expense recorded as a result of adopting SFAS 123R was not material. For additional
  information, see Note 17. Stock-Based Compensation.

The anticipated combined earnings impact on PSEG of adopting FIN 48 and FSP 13-2 is a reduction of $25 million to $35 million in 2007, as compared to 2006, primarily related to the impact on
  Energy Holdings.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” (SFAS 158)

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

Effective December 31, 2006, PSEG adopted SFAS 158, which requires that companies record the under or over funded positions of defined benefit pension and Other Postretirement Benefits (OPEB)
  plans on the balance sheet. In addition, the statement requires that the total unrecognized costs for defined benefit pension and OPEB plans be recorded as an after-tax charge to Accumulated Other
  Comprehensive Income, a separate component of Stockholder’s Equity. However, for PSE&G, because the amortization of the unrecognized costs is being collected from customers, the accumulated
  unrecognized costs are recorded as a Regulatory Asset.

Prior to SFAS 158, accounting guidance required that unrecognized costs be presented in a footnote to the financial statements as part of a reconciliation of a plan’s funded status to amounts recorded
  in the financial statements.

SFAS 158 is applied prospectively and the incremental impact on the individual Balance Sheet line items is disclosed in Note 16. Pension, OPEB and Savings Plans. Under SFAS 158 there is no change
  to the calculation of annual pension or OPEB expense.

Note 3. Asset Retirement Obligations (AROs)

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

On December 31, 2005, PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings completed their analyses under FIN 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” (FIN 47) which was issued in
  March 2005 to clarify certain guidance set forth in SFAS 143 and quantified conditional AROs identified that were previously not estimable. As a result of adopting FIN 47, PSEG recorded an additional
  ARO liability of approximately $246 million, including $210 million at PSE&G and $35 million at Power. PSEG also recorded a charge for a Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle of $(17)
  million, after-tax, $(16) million of which relates to Power, with the remainder at Energy Holdings and Services.

During 2006, PSE&G incurred and recorded less than $1 million related to new liabilities under FIN 47. On December 31, 2006, Power made revisions to certain AROs previously recorded under SFAS
  143 and FIN 47, resulting in a decrease to the ARO liability and ARO asset of $119 million.

The following table reflects pro forma results for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, excluding the Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle recorded upon the adoption in
  2005, and including accretion and depreciation expense relating to the additional AROs identified under FIN 47, as if it had always been in effect.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PSEG

In addition to amounts recorded at PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, discussed below, Services has an immaterial conditional ARO related to its obligation to restore a leased office space to rentable
  condition upon lease termination.

PSE&G

PSE&G has a conditional ARO for legal obligations identified under FIN 47 related to the removal of asbestos and underground storage tanks at certain industrial establishments, removal of wood poles,
  leases and licenses, and the requirement to seal natural gas pipelines at all sources of gas when the pipelines are no longer in service. PSE&G did not record an ARO for PSE&G’s protected steel and poly
  based natural gas transmission lines, as management believes that these categories of transmission lines have an indeterminable life.

Power

Power’s ARO liability primarily relates to the decommissioning of its nuclear power plants. Power maintains an independent external trust to fund decommissioning of its nuclear facilities upon
  termination of operation. For additional information, see Note 13. Nuclear Decommissioning. Power also identified conditional AROs under FIN 47, primarily related to Power’s fossil generation units,
  including liabilities for the removal of asbestos, stored hazardous liquid material and underground storage tanks from industrial power sites, restoration of leased office space to rentable condition upon
  lease termination, permits and authorizations, the restoration of an area occupied by a reservoir when the reservoir is no longer needed, the demolition of certain plants and the restoration of the sites at
  which they reside when the plants are no longer in service.

Energy Holdings

Energy Holdings had identified an immaterial legal obligation under FIN 47 for Electroandes S.A.’s (Electroandes) water and infrastructure easement rights recognition agreement that expired in
  December 2006.

PSEG, PSE&G and Power

On December 31, 2006, under SFAS 143, Power recorded a decrease to the ARO liability and asset of $117 million related to revisions in assumptions regarding the timing of the decommissioning of its
  nuclear facilities and estimated decommissioning cash flows. Also on December 31, 2006, under FIN 47, Power recorded a decrease to the ARO liability and asset of $2 million to reflect an expected life
  extension of certain fossil plants. The impact of these revisions, as well as other changes to the ARO liabilities for PSEG, PSE&G and Power during 2006, are presented in the following table:

Lawrenceburg Energy Center (Lawrenceburg)

On December 29, 2006, Power entered into an agreement to sell its Lawrenceburg facility located in Lawrenceburg, Indiana to AEP Generating Company, a subsidiary of American Electric Power
  Company, Inc. (AEP). The facility is a 1,080-megawatt, gas-fired combined cycle electric generating plant that entered commercial operation in the summer of 2004.

The sale price for the facility and inventory is $325 million. The proceeds, together with anticipated reduction in tax liability, is expected to be approximately $425 million and will be used to retire debt.
  Power and PSEG have determined the transaction will result in an after-tax charge to PSEG and Power earnings of approximately $208 million, or about $0.82 cents per share of PSEG common stock and it
  is reflected as a charge in Discontinued Operations.

The sale is subject to approval by FERC, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, compliance with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, and may also require certain state
  regulatory approvals in Indiana. It is anticipated that the transaction will close in the second quarter of 2007.

Lawrenceburg’s operating results for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, which were reclassified to Discontinued Operations, are summarized below:

Waterford Generation Facility (Waterford)

In September 2005, Power completed the sale of its electric generation facility located in Waterford, Ohio to a subsidiary of AEP. In May 2005, Power recognized an estimated loss on disposal of $177

Thermal Energy Development Partnership, L.P. (Tracy Biomass)

On December 22, 2006, Global entered into an agreement to sell its 34.5% interest in Tracy Biomass for approximately $7 million. The sale closed on January 26, 2007 and resulted in a 2007 pre-tax
  gain of approximately $7 million ($6 million after-tax).

Empresa de Energia Rio Negro S.A. (Edersa)

On December 21, 2006, SAESA group completed the sale of its 50% indirect interest in Edersa (an Argentinian utility company) for an insignificant amount, and realized an after-tax benefit of $18
  million.

Magellan Capital Holdings Corporation (MCHC)

During the fourth quarter of 2006, Global sold its interest in the MCHC generation development project for $1 million, resulting in a pre-tax loss of approximately $4 million ($2 million after-tax).

Rio Grande Energia S. A. (RGE)

On May 10, 2006, Global entered into an agreement with Companhia Paulista de Force Luz (CPFL) to sell its 32% ownership interest in RGE, a Brazilian electric distribution company. The transaction
  closed on June 23, 2006 and gross proceeds of $185 million were received. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax write-


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

down of $263 million ($178 million after-tax), primarily related to the devaluation of the Brazilian Real subsequent to Global’s acquisition of its interests in RGE in 1997.

Dhofar Power Company S.A.O.C. (Dhofar Power)

In April 2005, Global sold a 35% interest in Dhofar Power through a public offering on the Omani stock exchange as required under its Concession Agreement for the project, reducing Global’s
  ownership in Dhofar Power from 81% to 46%. Net proceeds from the sale were approximately $25 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 million ($1 million after-tax). As a result, Global’s
  investment in Dhofar Power was accounted for under the equity method following the sale.

On May 15, 2006, Global signed an agreement to sell its remaining 46% interest in Dhofar Power to Oman Technical Partners Ltd. (Oman). Global closed the sale in November 2006 and received net
  proceeds after-tax of approximately $31 million, the approximate book value of the investment.

Solar Electric Generating Systems (SEGS) Projects

In January 2005, Resources and Global sold their minority limited partner interests in three SEGS projects for proceeds of approximately $7 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $7 million ($4 million
  after-tax).

Meiya Power Company Limited (MPC)

In December 2004, Global closed on the sale of its 50% equity interest in MPC to BTU Power Company for approximately $236 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $35 million ($6 million loss after-
  tax).

Luz del Sur S.A.A. (LDS)

In April 2004, Global sold a portion of its indirect ownership in LDS in the Lima stock exchange, reducing its ownership from 44% to 38% and received gross proceeds of approximately $31 million and
  realized a pre-tax gain of approximately $7 million ($5 million after-tax).

GWF Energy LLC (GWF Energy)

In February 2004, Harbinger GWF LLC (Harbinger) purchased a 14.9% ownership interest in GWF Energy from Global for approximately $14 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $2 million ($1
  million after-tax). As a result of the sale, Global has a 60% interest in GWF Energy.

Resources

On October 16, 2006, Resources entered into an agreement under which Puget Sound Energy, Inc. will purchase Whitehorn Units Nos. 2 and 3 from Resources on the current lease expiration date of
  February 2, 2009 for a cash price of approximately $23 million. This transaction is expected to produce approximately $3 million of incremental after-tax income and $3 million of incremental cash flow for
  Resources, at such time.

On December 28, 2005, Resources sold its interest in the Seminole Generation Station Unit 2 (Seminole), a 659 MW coal-fired facility in Palatka, Florida, to Seminole Electric Cooperative Inc. for $286
  million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $71 million ($43 million after-tax).

Resources was the equity investor in a Boeing B767 leased to United Airlines (UAL). In December 2002, UAL filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In 2005, Resources received a notice from
  the Trustee under the UAL lease that the lenders had terminated the lease and repossessed the aircraft. Upon receipt of this notice, Resources recorded a $21 million pre-tax ($15 million after-tax) charge
  to write-off the carrying value of this investment.

Resources was also the equity investor in two operating leases with Northwest Airlines (Northwest) B 757-200 and Delta Airlines (Delta) B 737-200. On September 14, 2005 both Northwest and Delta
  filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code, as anticipated. In 2004 and 2005, Resources successfully restructured the leases and converted the Delta and Northwest leases from
  leveraged leases to operating leases. The Delta aircraft was sold in January 2006 generating a small gain for Resources.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In January 2005, a KKR Fund, in which Resources had invested, sold its investment in KinderCare Learning Centers, Inc. and Resources received proceeds of approximately $17 million resulting in a
  pre-tax gain of approximately $1 million ($1 million after-tax).

In March 2004, Resources entered into an agreement with Midwest Generation LLC, an indirect subsidiary of Edison Mission Energy, to terminate its lease investment in the Collins generating facility
  in Illinois. Resources received gross proceeds of approximately $184 million, $84 million after taxes, and recorded a pre-tax loss of $17 million ($11 million after-tax).

In 2004, Resources terminated two lease transactions with Qantas Airways and China Eastern Airlines Co., Ltd resulting from the lessees exercising their respective purchase options. Resources
  received aggregate gross cash proceeds of approximately $45 million ($9 million after-tax) and recorded a pre-tax gain of $0 ($4 million after-tax).

Acquisitions

Energy Holdings

Prisma 2000 S.p.A. (Prisma)

In May 2006, Global forgave the guarantees of its partner in the Prisma investment of certain loans Global had made to Prisma and converted such loans totaling $38 million into additional equity in
  Prisma, thereby increasing its ownership interest from 50% to 85% and giving Global voting control of the project. As a result, Energy Holdings began consolidating this investment in May 2006 and
  reclassified the investment balance to Property, Plant and Equipment of approximately $62 million, Long-Term Investments of approximately $13 million, Capital Lease Obligations of approximately $40
  million and certain other assets and liabilities on Energy Holdings’ Consolidated Balance Sheet. Energy Holdings recorded certain immaterial purchase accounting adjustments to reflect the plant, contracts
  and investment in Biomasse Italia S.p.A. (Biomasse) at fair value. The purchase price allocation has not yet been finalized since, due to recent events, Global has not been able to complete its appraisal of
  the land or finalize certain legal contingencies for the pre-acquisition period. For additional information, see Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

Impairments

Power

Power owns four turbines for which it has no immediate use. Power believes that newer technology would be more flexible and efficient for use in new projects. In addition, potential buyers have
  expressed interest in purchasing the turbines from Power. For these reasons, in December 2006, Power recorded a pre-tax impairment loss of $44 million to write-down the turbines to their estimated
  realizable value and has reclassified them to Assets Held For Sale on Power’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006.

Energy Holdings

Venezuela

During Energy Holdings’ review of its equity method investments, management concluded that due to the current political situation in Venezuela, it is probable that Energy Holdings would not be able
  to recover its capitalized costs associated with the investments in Venezuela. Therefore, Energy Holdings recorded a pre-tax impairment loss of approximately $7 million to write-down these investments in
  the fourth quarter of 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the book value of these investments was approximately $35 million.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 5. Regulatory Matters

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

PSE&G

PSE&G prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 71. A regulated utility is required to defer the recognition of costs (a regulatory asset) or the recognition of obligations
  (a regulatory liability) if it is probable that, through the rate-making process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future rates. Accordingly, PSE&G has deferred certain costs, which will be
  amortized over various future periods. These costs are deferred based on rate orders issued by the BPU or FERC or PSE&G’s experience with prior rate cases. All of PSE&G’s regulatory assets and liabilities
  at December 31, 2006 and 2005 are supported by written rate orders, either explicitly or implicitly through the BPU’s treatment of various cost items. Regulatory assets are subject to prudence reviews and
  can be disallowed in the future by regulatory authorities. PSE&G believes that all of its regulatory assets are probable of recovery. To the extent that collection of any regulatory assets or payments of
  regulatory liabilities is no longer probable, the amounts would be charged or credited to income.

PSE&G had the following regulatory assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from PSE&G’s rate base unless otherwise noted. The descriptions below define certain regulatory items.

Securitized Costs:

This reflects deferred costs, which are being recovered through the securitization transition charge authorized by the BPU. Funds collected through the securitization transition charge are
  remitted to Transition Funding and Transition Funding II and are used for interest and principal payments on the transition bonds and related costs and taxes.

Pension and Other Post Retirement Plans:

Pursuant to the adoption of SFAS 158, PSE&G recorded the unrecognized costs for defined benefit pension and OPEB plans on the balance sheet as a regulatory
  asset. These costs represent actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs and transition obligations as a result of adoption, which have not been expensed. These costs will be amortized and recovered in
  future rates.

SBC:

The SBC, as authorized by the BPU and the New Jersey Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act (EDECA), includes costs related to PSE&G’s electric and gas business as follows: 1) the
  universal service fund; 2) Demand Side Management (DSM) programs; 3) social programs which include bad debt expense; 4) the New Jersey Clean Energy Program costs payable in 2007 through 2008,
  recorded at discounted present value; and 5) the Remediation Adjustment Clause for incurred MGP remediation expenditures. All components except for Clean Energy accrue interest.

MGP Remediation Costs:

Represents the low end of the range for the remaining environmental investigation and remediation program costs that are probable of recovery in future rates.

Deferred Income Taxes:

This amount represents the portion of deferred income taxes that will be recovered through future rates, based upon established regulatory practices, which permit the recovery of
  current taxes. Accordingly, this regulatory asset is offset by a deferred tax liability and is expected to be recovered, without interest, over the period the underlying book-tax timing differences reverse and
  become current taxes.

Gas Contract Mark-to-Market:

The fair value of gas hedge contracts and gas cogeneration supply contracts. This asset is offset by derivative liability and an intercompany payable on the balance sheet.

OPEB-Related Costs:

Includes costs associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 106 “Employers’ Accounting for Benefits Other Than Pensions” which were deferred in accordance with EITF Issue No. 92-
  12, “Accounting for OPEB Costs by Rate Regulated Enterprises.”

Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt:

Represents losses on reacquired long-term debt, which are recovered through rates over the remaining life of the debt.

Conditional Asset Retirement Obligation:

These costs represent the differences between rate regulated cost of removal accounting and asset retirement accounting under GAAP. These costs will be
  recovered in future rates.

Repair Allowance:

This represents tax, interest and carrying charges relating to disallowed tax deductions for repair allowance as authorized by the BPU with recovery over 10 years effective August 1,
  2003.

Regulatory Restructuring Costs:

These are costs related to the restructuring of the energy industry in New Jersey through EDECA and include such items as the system design work necessary to transition
  PSE&G to a transmission and distribution only company, as well as costs incurred to transfer and establish the generation function as a separate corporate entity with recovery over 10 years beginning August
  1, 2003.

Plant and Regulatory Study Costs:

These are costs incurred by PSE&G and required by the BPU which are related to current and future operations, including safety, planning, management and construction.

Gas Margin Adjustment Clause:

PSE&G defers the margin differential received from Transportation Gas Service Non-Firm Customers versus bill credits provided to BGSS-Firm customers.

Asbestos Abatement Costs:

Represents costs incurred to remove and dispose of asbestos insulation at PSE&G’s fossil generating stations. Per a BPU order dated December 9, 1992, these costs are treated as
  Cost of Removal for ratemaking purposes.

Unrealized Losses on Interest Rate Swap:

This represents the costs related to Transition Funding’s interest rate swap that are being recovered without interest over the life of Transition Funding’s transition
  bonds. This asset is offset by a derivative liability on the balance sheet.

Decontamination and Decommissioning Costs:

These costs are related to PSE&G’s obligation for nuclear decontamination and decommissioning costs of U.S. Department of Energy enrichment sites prior to
  the generation asset transfer to Power in 2000.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Other Regulatory Assets:

This includes deferred consolidated billing start-up and deferred Energy Information Control Network program costs.

Cost of Removal:

PSE&G accrues and collects for Cost of Removal in rates. Pursuant to the adoption of SFAS 143, the liability for Cost of Removal was reclassified as a regulatory liability. This liability is
  reduced as removal costs are incurred. Cost of removal is a reduction to the rate base.

Overrecovered Electric Energy Costs:

This clause was established by the EDECA to account for above market costs related to Non-Utility Generation (NUG) contracts, as approved by the BPU. Costs or
  benefits associated with the restructuring of these contracts are deferred. This clause also includes Basic Generation Service (BGS) costs in excess of current rates, as approved by the BPU.

Overrecovered Gas Costs:

Represents PSE&G’s gas costs in excess of the amount included in rates and probable of refund in the future.

Excess Cost of Removal:

The BPU directed PSE&G to refund $66M of excess gas cost of removal accruals over a 5 year period ending November 2011.

Other Regulatory Liabilities:

This includes the following: 1) a retail adder included in the BGS charges beginning on August 1, 2003 that are now paid on a quarterly basis to the State of New Jersey; 2)
  amounts collected from customers in order for Transition Funding to obtain a AAA rating on its transition bonds; and 3) Third party billing discounts related to the EDECA.

The $23 million decrease in income tax effect on pre-tax income of leveraged leases in 2006 as compared to 2005, was primarily due to the absence of the tax expense resulting from the sale of
  Resources’ interest in Seminole in 2005. For additional information regarding the sale of Seminole, see Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments.

The $52 million increase in income tax effect on pre-tax income of leveraged leases in 2005 as compared to 2004, was primarily due to the sale of Resources’ interest in Seminole in 2005 and additional
  benefits resulting from revisions to the revenue and tax calculations of certain of Resources’ leveraged lease investments performed in the fourth quarter of 2005 resulting from changes in certain lease
  forecast assumptions pertaining to state income taxes. A change in a key assumption which affects the estimated total net income over the life of a leveraged lease requires a recalculation of the leveraged
  lease, from inception, using the revised information. Any change in the net investment in the leveraged leases is recognized as a gain or loss in the year the assumption is changed. For additional information
  regarding the sale of Seminole, see Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments.

Partnership Investments and Corporate Joint Ventures

Energy Holdings’ partnership investments and corporate joint ventures are primarily accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

Investments in and Advances to Affiliates

Investments in net assets of affiliated companies accounted for under the equity method of accounting by Global amounted to $818 million and $1 billion as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
  respectively. During the three years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the amount of dividends from these investments was $72 million, $70 million and $89 million, respectively. Global’s share of
  income and cash flow distribution percentages ranged from 35% to 60% as of December 31, 2006. Interest is also earned on loans made to various projects. Such loans earn interest that ranged from 5% to
  7.5% during 2006.

As of December 31, 2006, Global’s recorded investment in equity method subsidiaries was $818 million as compared to $711 million of underlying equity in net assets of such investments. The
  difference primarily relates to an approximate $100 million investment in a foreign subsidiary which is classified as an equity

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The differences in the results of operations and the financial position as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 2005, were due to Global’s sale of a 35% interest in Dhofar Power
  in 2005, the sale of Global’s 32% ownership interest in RGE and the consolidation of Prisma in 2006. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations, Dispositions, Acquisitions and Impairments for further details of
  these transactions.

Global also has investments in certain companies in which it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence. Such investments are accounted for under the cost method. As of December 31,
  2006 and 2005, the carrying value of these investments aggregated $37 million and $39 million, respectively. Global periodically reviews these cost method investments for impairment and adjusts the values of these investments accordingly.

(A)

On November 16, 2005, PSEG issued approximately 11.4 million shares of its common stock for proceeds of approximately $460 million under the stock purchase obligation provision of the
      Participating Units issued by PSEG Funding Trust I in September, 2002. See Note 10. Schedule of Consolidated Debt.

(B)

For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, PSEG issued approximately 1.0 million, 1.2 million, and 1.9 million shares, respectively, for approximately $67 million, $72 million and $83
      million, respectively, under the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRASPP) and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). Total authorized and unissued shares of common stock
      available for issuance through PSEG’s DRASPP, ESPP and various employee benefit plans amounted to approximately 3.9 million shares as of December 31, 2006.

(C)

As of December 31, 2006, there was an aggregate of approximately 6.7 million shares of $100 par value and 10 million shares of $25 par value Cumulative Preferred Stock, which were authorized and
      unissued and which, upon issuance, may or may not provide for mandatory sinking fund redemption. If dividends upon any shares of Preferred Stock are in arrears for four consecutive quarters, holders
      receive voting rights for the election of a majority of PSE&G’s Board of Directors and continue until all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon have been paid, whereupon all such voting rights
      cease. There are no arrearages in cumulative preferred stock and hence currently no voting rights for preferred shares. No preferred stock agreement contains any liquidation preferences in excess of
      par values or any ‘deemed’ liquidation events.

(D)

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the annual dividend requirement and the embedded dividend rate for PSE&G’s Preferred Stock without Mandatory Redemption was approximately $4 million and
      5.03%, respectively, for each year.

As of each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the annual dividend requirement of PSEG’s Trust Preferred Securities (Guaranteed Preferred Beneficial Interest in PSEG’s Subordinated
      Debentures), including those issued in connection with the Participating Units, and their embedded costs was approximately $18 million and $96 million, respectively.

Enterprise Capital Trust I, Enterprise Capital Trust II, Enterprise Capital Trust III, Enterprise Capital Trust IV and PSEG Funding Trust II were formed and are controlled by PSEG for the purpose of
      issuing Quarterly Trust Preferred Securities (Quarterly Guaranteed Preferred Beneficial Interest in PSEG’s Subordinated Debentures). The proceeds were loaned to PSEG and are evidenced by
      Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debentures. If and for as long as payments on the Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debentures have been deferred, or PSEG had defaulted on the indentures related
      thereto or its guarantees thereof, PSEG may not pay any dividends on its common and preferred stock. The Subordinated Debentures support the following Preferred Securities issued by the trusts:

(L)

Non-recourse financing transactions consist of loans from banks and other lenders that are typically secured by project assets and cash flows and generally impose no material obligation on the parent-
      level investor to repay any debt incurred by the project borrower. The consequences of permitting a project-level default include the potential for loss of any invested equity by the parent. However, in
      some cases, certain obligations relating to the investment being financed, including additional equity commitments, may be guaranteed by Global and/or Energy Holdings for their respective
      subsidiaries. PSEG does not provide guarantees or credit support to Energy Holdings or its subsidiaries.

During 2006, Energy Holdings’ subsidiaries repaid approximately $51 million of non-recourse debt, of which $43 million related to SAESA and TIE, $6 million to Resources and $2 million to EGDC.

(M)

      converted floating rate Libor interest to a fixed rate of 5.4275% through December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2006, the Libor rate on the unswapped portion of the debt was 5.375% and the interest
      spread was 2.25%.

(N)

On April 27, 2006, 80% of the scheduled outstanding principal became subject to interest rate swaps that converted floating rate Libor to a weighted average fixed rate of 4.518%. At December 31,
      2006, the Libor rate on the unswapped portion of the debt was 5.375% and the interest spread was 1.875%.

Note 11. Financial Risk Management Activities

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

The operations of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices that could
  affect their results of operations and financial conditions. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings manage exposure to these market risks through their regular operating and financing activities and,
  when deemed appropriate, hedge these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments. PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings use the term ‘hedge’ to mean a strategy designed to manage risks
  of volatility in prices or rate movements on certain assets, liabilities or anticipated transactions and by creating a relationship in which gains or losses on derivative instruments are expected to
  counterbalance the gains or losses on the assets, liabilities or anticipated transactions exposed to such market risks. Each of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings uses derivative instruments as risk
  management tools consistent with its respective business plan and prudent business practices.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Energy Trading Contracts

Power

Power actively trades energy and energy-related products, including electricity, natural gas, electric capacity, firm transmission rights (FTRs), coal, oil and emission allowances in the spot, forward and
  futures markets, primarily in PJM Interconnection, L.L.C (PJM), but also in the surrounding region, which extends from Maine to the Carolinas and the Atlantic Coast to Indiana, and natural gas in the
  producing region.

Power maintains a strategy of entering into positions to optimize the value of its portfolio and reduce earnings volatility of generation assets, gas supply contracts and its electric and gas supply
  obligations. Power engages in physical and financial transactions in the electricity wholesale markets and executes an overall risk management strategy seeking to mitigate the effects of adverse movements
  in the fuel and electricity markets. These contracts also involve financial transactions including swaps, options and futures. There have been significant decreases in commodity prices over the last year. The
  resultant changes in market values for


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

energy and related contracts that qualify for hedge accounting have resulted in significant decreases to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. For additional information, see Note 12. Commitments and
  Contingent Liabilities. Power marks its derivative energy trading contracts to market in accordance with SFAS 133, with changes in fair value charged to the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
  Wherever possible, fair values for these contracts are obtained from quoted market sources. For contracts where no quoted market exists, modeling techniques are employed using assumptions reflective of
  current market rates, yield curves and forward prices, as applicable, to interpolate certain prices. The effect of using such modeling techniques is not material to Power’s financial results.

Commodity Contracts

Power

The availability and price of energy commodities are subject to fluctuations from factors such as weather, environmental policies, changes in supply and demand, state and federal regulatory policies,
  market conditions, transmission availability and other events. Power manages its risk of fluctuations of energy price and availability through derivative instruments, such as forward purchase or sale
  contracts, swaps, options, futures and FTRs.

Cash Flow Hedges

Power uses forward sale and purchase contracts, swaps and FTR contracts to hedge forecasted energy sales from its generation stations and to hedge related load obligations. Power also enters into
  swaps and futures transactions to hedge the price of fuel to meet its fuel purchase requirements. These derivative transactions are designated and effective as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133. As of
  December 31, 2006, the fair value of these hedges was $(166) million. These hedges, along with realized losses on hedges of $(19) million retained in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, resulted in a
  $(108) million after-tax impact on Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. As of December 31, 2005, the fair value of these hedges was $(951) million. These hedges, along with realized gains on hedges of
  $11 million retained in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, resulted in a $(558) million after-tax impact on Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. During 2007, $27 million (after-tax) of net
  unrealized and realized losses on these commodity derivatives is expected to be reclassified to earnings. Approximately $92 million of after-tax unrealized losses on these commodity derivatives in
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss is expected to be reclassified to earnings for the year ending December 31, 2008. Ineffectiveness associated with these hedges, as defined in SFAS 133, was $(3)
  million at December 31, 2006. The expiration date of the longest dated cash flow hedge is in 2009.

Other Derivatives

Power also enters into certain other contracts that are derivatives, but do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. Most of these contracts are used for fuel purchases for generation
  requirements and for electricity purchases for contractual sales obligations. Therefore, the changes in fair market value of these derivative contracts are recorded in Energy Costs or Operating Revenues, as
  appropriate, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The net fair value of these instruments as of December 31, 2006 was $1 million. The net fair value of these instruments as of December 31, 2005
  was not material.

Energy Holdings

Other Derivatives

TIE enters into electricity forward and capacity sale contracts to sell its 2,000 MW capacity for portions of the current calendar year, with the balance sold into the daily spot market. TIE also enters
  into gas purchase contracts to specifically match the generation requirements to support the electricity forward sales contracts. Although these contracts fix the amount of revenue, fuel costs and cash flows,
  and thereby provide financial stability to TIE, these contracts are, based on their terms, derivatives that do not meet the specific accounting criteria in SFAS 133 to qualify for the normal purchases and
  normal sales exception, or to be designated as a hedge for accounting purposes. As a result, these contracts must be recorded at fair value.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The net fair value of the open positions was approximately $38 million and $(7) million as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively.

Interest Rates

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. PSEG’s policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed and
  floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives.

Fair Value Hedges

PSEG and Power

In March 2004, Power issued $250 million of 3.75% Senior Notes due April 2009. PSEG used an interest rate swap to convert Power’s fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. The interest rate swap is
  designated and effective as a fair value hedge. The fair value changes of the interest rate swap are fully offset by the fair value changes in the underlying debt. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31,
  2005, the fair value of the hedge was $(9) million and $(10) million, respectively.

Cash Flow Hedges

PSEG, PSE&G and Energy Holdings

PSEG, PSE&G and Energy Holdings use interest rate swaps and other interest rate derivatives to manage their exposures to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to variable-rate debt
  instruments. The interest rate derivatives used are designated and effective as cash flow hedges. Except for PSE&G’s cash flow hedges, the fair value changes of these derivatives are initially recorded in
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of these cash flow hedges was $(4) million, primarily at PSE&G. As of December 31, 2005, the fair value of these cash flow
  hedges was $(17) million, including $(11) million and $(6) million at PSE&G and Energy Holdings, respectively. The $(4) million and $(11) million at PSE&G as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005,
  respectively, is not included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, as it is deferred as a Regulatory Asset and is expected to be recovered from PSE&G’s customers. During the next 12 months,
  approximately $1 million of unrealized losses (net of taxes) on interest rate derivatives in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss is expected to be reclassified at PSEG. As of
  December 31, 2006, there was no hedge ineffectiveness associated with these hedges. The amounts above do not include the fair value of approximately $(60) million as of December 31, 2005 for the cash
  flow hedges at Elcho, which had been reclassified into Discontinued Operations.

Foreign Currencies

Energy Holdings

Global is exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risk that arise from investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. A key component of its risks is that some of its foreign
  subsidiaries and affiliates have functional currencies other than the consolidated reporting currency, the U.S. Dollar. Additionally, Global and certain of its foreign subsidiaries and affiliates have entered
  into monetary obligations and maintain receipts/receivables in U.S. Dollars or currencies other than their own functional currencies. Global, a U.S. Dollar functional currency entity, is primarily exposed to
  changes in the Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the Chilean Peso and to a lesser extent, the Euro. Changes in valuation of these currencies can impact the value of Global’s investments, results of operations,
  financial condition and cash flows. Global has attempted to limit potential foreign exchange exposure by entering into revenue contracts that adjust for changes in foreign exchange rates. Global also uses
  foreign currency forward, swap and option agreements to manage risk related to certain foreign currency fluctuations.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Although the Chilean Peso and the Peruvian Nuevo Sol had originally depreciated relative to the U.S. Dollar after Global’s initial investments, the currencies have appreciated significantly over the
  past few years. The net cumulative foreign currency revaluations had increased the total amount of Energy Holdings’ Member’s Equity by $134 million as of December 31, 2006.

Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations

Energy Holdings

In March 2004 and April 2004, Energy Holdings entered into four cross currency interest rate swap agreements. The swaps are designed to hedge the net investment in a foreign subsidiary associated
  with the exposure in the U.S. Dollar to Chilean Peso exchange rate. The fair value of the cross currency swaps was $(25) million and $(33) million as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005,
  respectively. The change in fair value of the majority of the swaps is recorded in Cumulative Translation Adjustment within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. As a result, Energy Holdings’
  Member’s Equity was reduced by $23 million as of December 31, 2006. A portion of the swap, $(38) million, was dedesignated as a hedge in December 2006.

Note 12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

Nuclear Insurance Coverages and Assessments

Power

Power is a member of an industry mutual insurance company, Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), which provides the primary property and decontamination liability insurance at Salem
  Nuclear Generating Station (Salem), Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station (Hope Creek) and Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station (Peach Bottom). NEIL also provides excess property insurance
  through its decontamination liability, decommissioning liability and excess property policy and replacement power coverage through its accidental outage policy. NEIL policies may make retrospective
  premium assessments in case of adverse loss experience. Power’s maximum potential liabilities under these assessments are included in the table and notes below. Certain provisions in the NEIL policies
  provide that the insurer may suspend coverage with respect to all nuclear units on a site without notice if the NRC suspends or revokes the operating license for any unit on that site, issues a shutdown order
  with respect to such unit or issues a confirmatory order keeping such unit down.

The American Nuclear Insurers (ANI) and NEIL policies both include coverage for claims arising out of acts of terrorism. Both ANI and NEIL make a distinction between certified and non-certified
  acts of terrorism, as defined under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), and thus their policies respond accordingly. For non-certified acts of terrorism, ANI policies are subject to an industry
  aggregate limit of $300 million, subject to reinstatement at ANI discretion. Similarly, NEIL policies are subject to an industry aggregate limit of $3.2 billion plus any amounts available through reinsurance
  or indemnity for non-certified acts of terrorism. For certified acts, Power’s nuclear liability ANI and nuclear property NEIL policies will respond similarly to other covered events.

The Price-Anderson Act sets the “limit of liability” for claims that could arise from an incident involving any licensed nuclear facility in the U.S. The “limit of liability” is based on the number of
  licensed nuclear reactors and is adjusted at least every five years based on the Consumer Price Index. The current ‘limit of liability’ is $10.8 billion. All utilities owning a nuclear reactor, including Power,
  have provided for this exposure through a combination of private insurance and mandatory participation in a financial protection pool as established by the Price-Anderson Act. Under the Price-Anderson
  Act, each party with an ownership interest in a nuclear reactor can be assessed its share of $101 million per reactor per incident, payable at $15 million per reactor per incident per year. If the damages
  exceed the “limit of liability,” the President is to submit to Congress a plan for providing additional compensation to the injured parties. Congress could impose further revenue-raising measures on the
  nuclear industry to pay claims. Power’s maximum aggregate assessment per incident is $317 million (based on Power’s ownership interests in Hope Creek, Peach Bottom


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

and Salem) and its maximum aggregate annual assessment per incident is $48 million. This does not include the $11 million that could be assessed under the nuclear worker policies. Further, a decision by
  the U.S. Supreme Court, not involving Power, has held that the Price-Anderson Act did not preclude awards based on state law claims for punitive damages.

The primary limit for Public Liability is a per site aggregate limit with no potential for assessment. The Nuclear Worker Liability represents the potential liability from workers claiming exposure to the
      hazard of nuclear radiation. This coverage is subject to an industry aggregate limit that is subject to reinstatement at ANI discretion and has an assessment potential under former canceled policies.

(B)

Retrospective premium program under the Price-Anderson Act liability provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Power is subject to retrospective assessment with respect to loss from
      an incident at any licensed nuclear reactor in the U.S. that produces greater than 100 megawatts (MW) of electrical power. This retrospective assessment can be adjusted for inflation every five years.
      The last adjustment was effective as of August 20, 2003. This retrospective program is in excess of the Public and Nuclear Worker Liability primary layers.

(C)

Limit of liability under the Price-Anderson Act for each nuclear incident.

(D)

For property limits in excess of $1.1 billion, Power participates in a Blanket Limit policy where the $1.0 billion limit is shared by Power with Amergen Energy Company, LLC and Exelon Generation
      Company, LLC (Exelon Generation) among the Braidwood, Byron, Clinton, Dresden, La Salle, Limerick, Oyster Creek, Quad Cities, TMI-1 facilities owned by Amergen and Exelon and the Peach
      Bottom, Salem and Hope Creek facilities. This limit is not subject to reinstatement in the event of a loss. Participation in this program materially reduces Power’s premium and the associated potential
      assessment.

(E)

Peach Bottom has an aggregate indemnity limit based on a weekly indemnity of $2.3 million for 52 weeks followed by 80% of the weekly indemnity for 68 weeks. Salem has an aggregate indemnity
      limit based on a weekly indemnity of $2.5 million for 52 weeks followed by 80% of the weekly indemnity for 75 weeks. Hope Creek has an aggregate indemnity limit based on a weekly indemnity of
      $4.5 million for 52 weeks followed by 80% of the weekly indemnity for 71 weeks.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Guaranteed Obligations

Power

Power has unconditionally guaranteed payments by its subsidiaries, ER&T and PSEG Power New York Inc. (Power New York) in commodity-related transactions in the ordinary course of business.
  These payment guarantees are provided to counterparties in order to obtain credit under physical and financial agreements for gas, power, pipeline capacity, transportation, oil, electricity and related
  commodities and services. These payment guarantees support the current exposure, interest and other costs on sums due and payable by ER&T and Power New York. Under these agreements, guarantees
  offered for trading and marketing cover lines of credit between entities and are often reciprocal in nature. The exposure between counterparties can move in either direction. The face value of the
  guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $1.6 billion. In order for Power to incur a liability for the face value of the outstanding guarantees, ER&T and Power New York
  would have to fully utilize the credit granted to it by every counterparty to whom Power has provided a guarantee and all of ER&T’s and Power New York’s contracts would have to be “out-of-the-money”
  (if the contracts are terminated, Power would owe money to the counterparties). The probability of all contracts at ER&T and Power New York being simultaneously “out-of-the-money” is highly unlikely
  due to offsetting positions within the portfolio. For this reason, the current exposure at any point in time is a more meaningful representation of the potential liability to Power under these guarantees. The
  current exposure consists of the net of accounts receivable and accounts payable and the forward value on open positions, less any margins posted. The current exposure from such liabilities was $518
  million and $549 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Power is subject to collateral calls related to commodity contracts that are bilateral and are subject to certain creditworthiness standards as guarantor under performance guarantees for ER&T’s
  agreements. Changes in commodity prices, including fuel, emissions allowances and electricity, can have a material impact on margin requirements under such contracts that are entered into in the normal
  course of business. As of December 31, 2006, Power had posted margin of approximately $40 million, primarily in the form of letters of credit, and received margin of approximately $86 million, including
  approximately $82 million in the form of letters of credit, to satisfy collateral obligations and support various contractual and environmental obligations. As of December 31, 2005, Power had posted margin
  of approximately $1.2 billion, including approximately $1 billion in the form of letters of credit, and received margin of approximately $168 million, including approximately $115 million in the form of
  letters of credit.

In the event of a deterioration of Power’s credit rating to below investment grade, which represents a two level downgrade from its current ratings, many of these agreements allow the counterparty to
  demand that ER&T provide further performance assurance, generally in the form of a letter of credit or cash. As of December 31, 2006, if Power were to lose its investment grade rating and, assuming all
  counterparties to which ER&T is “out-of-the-money” were contractually entitled to demand, and demanded, performance assurance, ER&T could be required to post additional collateral in an amount equal to
  approximately $578 million. Power believes that it has sufficient liquidity to post such collateral, if necessary.

Power also routinely enters into exchange-traded futures and options transactions for electricity and natural gas as part of its operations. Generally, such future contracts require a deposit of cash
  margin, the amount of which is subject to change based on market movement and in accordance with exchange rules. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, Power had deposited margin of approximately $89
  million and $176 million, respectively, related to exchange-traded transactions that are margined and monitored separately from physical trading activity.

Global sold its investments in Poland in 2006. Global’s obligation for Elcho was terminated as a result of the sale, however, it is still obligated for the equity commitment guarantee at Skawina. If
      payments are required, such payments are guaranteed by CEZ in accordance with the purchase agreement.

In September 2003, Energy Holdings completed the sale of PSEG Energy Technologies Inc. (Energy Technologies) and nearly all of its assets. However, Energy Holdings retained certain outstanding
  construction and warranty obligations related to ongoing construction projects previously performed by Energy Technologies. These construction obligations have performance bonds issued by insurance
  companies for which exposure is adequately supported by the outstanding letters of credit shown in the table above for PSEG Energy Technologies Asset Management Company LLC. As of December 31,
  2006, there were $14 million of such bonds outstanding, which are related to uncompleted construction projects. These performance bonds are not included in the $82 million of guaranteed obligations
  above.

Environmental Matters

PSEG, PSE&G and Power

Hazardous Substances

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) has regulations in effect concerning site investigation and remediation that require an ecological evaluation of potential damages to
  natural resources in connection with an environmental investigation of contaminated sites. These regulations may substantially increase the costs of environmental investigations and necessary remediation,
  particularly at sites situated on surface water bodies. PSE&G, Power and respective predecessor companies own or owned and/or operate or operated certain facilities situated on surface water bodies, certain
  of which are currently the subject of remedial activities.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that a six-mile stretch of the Passaic River in the area of Newark, New Jersey is a “facility” within the meaning of that term under
  the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). PSE&G and certain of its predecessors conducted industrial operations at properties adjacent to
  the Passaic River facility. The operations included one operating electric generating station (Essex Site), one former generating station and four former manufactured gas plants (MGPs). PSE&G’s costs to
  clean up former MGPs are recoverable from utility customers through the SBC. PSE&G has sold the site of the former generating station and obtained releases and indemnities for liabilities arising out of the
  site in connection with the sale. The Essex Site was transferred to Power in August 2000. Power assumed any environmental liabilities of PSE&G associated with the electric generating stations that PSE&G
  transferred to it, including the Essex Site.

In 2003, the EPA notified 41 potentially responsible parties (PRPs), including PSE&G and Power, that it was expanding its assessment of the Passaic River Study Area to the entire 17-mile tidal reach of
  the lower


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Passaic River. The EPA further indicated, with respect to PSE&G, that it believed that hazardous substances had been released from the Essex Site and a former MGP located in Harrison, New Jersey
  (Harrison Site), which also includes facilities for PSE&G’s ongoing gas operations. The EPA estimated that its study would require five to eight years to complete and would cost approximately $20 million, of
  which it would seek to recover $10 million from the PRPs, including PSE&G and Power. Power has provided notice to insurers concerning this potential claim.

Also, in 2003, PSEG, PSE&G and 56 other PRPs received a Directive and Notice to Insurers from the NJDEP that directed the PRPs to arrange for a natural resource damage assessment and interim
  compensatory restoration of natural resource injuries along the lower Passaic River and its tributaries pursuant to the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act. The NJDEP alleged in the Directive
  that it had determined that hazardous substances had been discharged from the Essex Site and the Harrison Site. The NJDEP announced that it had estimated the cost of interim natural resource injury
  restoration activities along the lower Passaic River to approximate $950 million.

PSE&G and Power have indicated to both the EPA and NJDEP that they are willing to work with the agencies in an effort to resolve their respective claims and, along with approximately 65 other
  PRPs, have entered into an agreement with the EPA or have indicated their intention to enter an agreement that provides for sharing the costs of the $20 million study between the government
  organizations and the PRPs. The EPA recently has notified the PRPs that the cost of the study will greatly exceed the $20 million initially estimated and offered to the PRPs the opportunity to conduct the
  study themselves rather than reimburse the government for the additional costs it incurs. The PRP group is considering the offer and has engaged in discussions with the EPA. Whether the PRP group, or
  some number of the PRPs, agree to assume responsibility for the study will depend upon many factors, including a revised estimated cost of the study, the number of parties who agree to participate and the
  manner in which the parties divide the costs among themselves. PSEG, PSE&G and Power cannot predict what further actions, if any, or the costs or the timing thereof, that may be required with respect to
  the Passaic River or natural resource damages. However, such costs could be material.

PSE&G

MGP Remediation Program

PSE&G is currently working with the NJDEP under a program to assess, investigate and remediate environmental conditions at PSE&G’s former MGP sites (Remediation Program). To date, 38 sites have
  been identified as sites requiring some level of remedial action. In addition, the NJDEP has announced initiatives to accelerate the investigation and subsequent remediation of the riverbeds underlying
  surface water bodies that have been impacted by hazardous substances from adjoining sites. Specifically, in 2005 the NJDEP initiated a program on the Delaware River aimed at identifying the ten most
  significant sites for cleanup. One of the sites identified is a former MGP facility located in Camden. The Remediation Program is periodically reviewed, and the estimated costs are revised by PSE&G based
  on regulatory requirements, experience with the program and available remediation technologies. Since the inception of the Remediation Program in 1988 through December 31, 2006, PSE&G had
  expenditures of approximately $384 million.

During the fourth quarter of 2006, PSE&G refined the detailed site estimates. The cost of remediating all sites to completion, as well as the anticipated costs to address MGP-related material discovered
  in two rivers adjacent to former MGP sites, could range between $798 million and $838 million. No amount within the range was considered to be most likely. Therefore, $414 million was accrued at
  December 31, 2006, which represents the difference between the low end of the total program cost estimate of $798 million and the total incurred costs through December 31, 2006 of $384 million. Of this
  amount, approximately $47 million was recorded in Other Current Liabilities and $367 million was reflected in Other Noncurrent Liabilities. The costs associated with the MGP Remediation Program have
  historically been recovered through the SBC charges to PSE&G ratepayers. As such, a $414 million Regulatory Asset was recorded.

Costs for the MGP Remediation Program were approximately $42 million in 2006. PSE&G anticipates spending $47 million in 2007, $50 million in 2008, and an average of approximately $40 million per
  year each year thereafter through 2016.

Power

Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)/New Source Review (NSR)

The PSD/NSR regulations, promulgated under the Clean Air Act (CAA), require major sources of certain air pollutants to obtain permits, install pollution control technology and obtain offsets, in
  some circumstances, when those sources undergo a “major modification,” as defined in the regulations. The Federal government may order companies not in compliance with the PSD/NSR regulations to
  install the best available control technology at the affected plants and to pay monetary penalties of up to approximately $27,500 for each day of continued violation.

The EPA and the NJDEP issued a demand in March 2000 under the CAA requiring information to assess whether projects completed since 1978 at the Hudson and Mercer coal-burning units were
  implemented in accordance with applicable PSD/NSR regulations. Power completed its response to requests for information and, in January 2002, reached an agreement with the NJDEP and the EPA to
  resolve allegations of noncompliance with PSD/NSR regulations. Under that agreement, over the course of 10 years, Power agreed to install advanced air pollution controls to reduce emissions of Sulfur
  Dioxide (SO


), Nitrogen Oxide (NO

x

), particulate matter and mercury from the coal-burning units at the Mercer and Hudson generating stations to ensure compliance with PSD/NSR. Power also agreed to
  spend at least $6 million on supplemental environmental projects and pay a $1 million civil penalty. The agreement resolving the NSR allegations concerning the Hudson and Mercer coal-fired units also
  resolved a dispute over Bergen 2 regarding the applicability of PSD requirements and allowed construction of the unit to be completed and operations to commence.

Power subsequently notified the EPA and the NJDEP that it was evaluating the continued operation of the Hudson coal unit in light of changes in the energy and capacity markets, increases in the cost
  of pollution control equipment and other necessary modifications to the unit. On November 30, 2006, Power, reached an agreement with the EPA and NJDEP on an amendment to its 2002 agreement
  intended to achieve the emissions reductions targets of this agreement while providing more time to assess the feasibility of installing additional advanced emissions controls at Hudson.

The amended agreement with the EPA and the NJDEP will allow Power to continue operating Hudson and extend for four years the deadline for installing environmental controls beyond the previous
  December 31, 2006 deadline. Power will be required to undertake a number of technology projects (SCRs), scrubbers, baghouses, and carbon injection, plant modifications, and operating procedure changes
  at Hudson and Mercer designed to meet targeted reductions in emissions of NO

x

, SO


, particulate matter, and mercury. In addition, Power has agreed to notify the EPA and NJDEP by the end of 2007
  whether it will install the additional emissions controls at Hudson by the end of 2010, or plan for the orderly shut down of the unit.

Under the program to date, Power has installed SCRs at Mercer at a cost of approximately $113 million. The cost of implementing the balance of the amended agreement at Mercer and Hudson is
  estimated at $400 million to $500 million for Mercer and at $600 million to $750 million for Hudson and will be incurred in the 2007-2010 timeframe. As part of the agreement, Fossil has agreed to purchase
  and retire emissions allowances, contribute approximately $3 million for programs to reduce particulate emissions from diesel engines in New Jersey, and pay a $6 million civil penalty.

As a result of the agreement, Power has increased its environmental reserves by approximately $14 million to account for civil penalties associated with the amendment to the agreement and other
  costs. PSEG and Power recorded the charge in Other Deductions on their respective Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Mercury Regulation

New Jersey and Connecticut have adopted standards for the reduction of emissions of mercury from coal-fired electric generating units. In February 2007, Pennsylvania also issued new requirements for
  the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. Connecticut requires coal-fired power plants in Connecticut to achieve either an emissions limit or a 90% mercury removal efficiency
  through technology installed to control mercury emissions effective in July 2008. The regulations in New Jersey require coal-fired electric generating units in New Jersey to meet certain emissions limits or
  reduce emissions by 90% by December 15, 2007. Under the New Jersey regulations, companies that are parties to multi-pollutant reduction agreements are permitted to postpone such reductions on half of
  their coal-fired electric generating


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

capacity until December 15, 2012. Power has a multi-pollutant reduction agreement with the NJDEP as a result of a consent decree that resolved issues arising out of the PSD and the NSR air pollution
  control programs at the Hudson, Mercer and Bergen facilities. The estimated costs of technology believed to be capable of meeting these emissions limits at Power’s coal-fired unit in Connecticut and at its
  Mercer Station are included in Power’s capital expenditures forecast. Total estimated costs for each project are between $150 million and $200 million. The Mercer expenditures are included in the
  PSD/NSR discussion above.

On September 12, 2006, Connecticut released proposed revisions to mercury regulations that encompass “Permit Requirements for Mercury Emissions from Coal-Fired Electric Generating Units”.
  Also, Pennsylvania has proposed mercury regulations that would require reductions in mercury emissions at each facility as well as cap on total emissions. As proposed, the regulations do not impose
  requirements that would materially affect the costs already identified in Power’s capital expenditures forecast. Impact of any final regulations cannot be determined at this time.

New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act (ISRA)

Potential environmental liabilities related to subsurface contamination at certain generating stations have been identified. In the second quarter of 1999, in anticipation of the transfer of PSE&G’s
  generation-related assets to Power, a study was conducted pursuant to ISRA, which applies to the sale of certain assets. Power had a $51 million liability as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005
  related to these obligations, which is included in Other Noncurrent Liabilities on Power’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Environmental Costs on PSEG’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Permit Renewals

In June 2001, the NJDEP issued a renewed New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) permit for Salem, expiring in July 2006, allowing for the continued operation of Salem with
  its existing cooling water system. A renewal application prepared in accordance with FWPCA Section 316(b) and the new Phase II 316(b) rule was filed in February 2006 with the NJDEP, which allows the
  station to continue operating under its existing NJPDES permit until a new permit is issued. Power’s application to renew Salem’s NJPDES permit demonstrates that the station satisfies FWPCA 316(b) and
  meets the Phase II 316(b) rule’s performance standards for reduction of impingement and entrainment through the station’s existing cooling water intake technology and operations plus implemented
  restoration measures. The application further demonstrates that even without the benefits of restoration the station meets the Phase II 316(b) rule’s site-specific determination standards, both on a
  comparison of the costs and benefits of new intake technology as well as a comparison of the costs to implement the technology at the facility to the cost estimates prepared by EPA. The U.S. Court of
  Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a decision after Power filed its application that rejected the use of restoration and the site-specific cost-benefit test under the Phase II 316(b) rule. If NJDEP were to
  require the installation of structures at the Salem facility to reduce cooling water intake flow commensurate with closed cycle cooling as a result of the unfavorable decision in the Phase II litigation,
  discussed, or otherwise, Power’s application to renew the permit estimated that the costs associated with cooling towers for Salem are approximately $1 billion, of which Power’s share would be
  approximately $575 million. If NJDEP and the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (CTDEP) were to require installation of closed-cycle cooling or its equivalent at Power’s five once-
  through cooled facilities, compliance with that requirement could have a significant impact on the facilities. These costs are not included in Power’s currently forecasted capital expenditures.

Energy Holdings

Prisma

In May 2006, Global became the majority shareholder of Prisma, which holds 100% of the stock of San Marco S.p.A (San Marco), owner of a 20 MW biomass generation facility in Italy. Global also
  assumed operational responsibility for the facility in May 2006. Global’s total investment in Prisma is approximately $84 million.

In August 2006, Global became aware that the Italian government was conducting a criminal investigation regarding allegations of violations of the facility’s air permit. The scope of the investigation
  was


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

subsequently expanded to include alleged violations of the facility’s waste recycling and waste storage permits. Until May 2006, the facility was operated by Carlo Gravazzi Green Power (CGGP) pursuant
  to a Services Agreement with a Global subsidiary. Alleged violations include exceedances of permit limits for regulated pollutants, manipulation of the facility’s continuous monitoring systems, false
  reporting and the use of fuels not authorized by the permit. The government has seized records from the facility in connection with the investigation including plant design documents and plant operating
  records. The Italian government has named five individuals as targets of the criminal investigation, including three current and former San Marco employees and members of the facility’s board of directors.
  While San Marco has not been named as a target, there is a potential risk that it could be so named. Global has retained separate counsel for San Marco and the named Global employees.

In December 2006 and January 2007, the facility was served with an Order and a Decree, respectively, that prohibit it from conducting operations to prevent recurring violations and the destruction of
  evidence. Counsel for San Marco has advised the prosecuting attorney that it will fully cooperate with the ongoing investigation and will implement the corrective actions required to prevent recurrence of
  the violations. Counsel recently filed an application, that was not objected to by the Prosecuting Attorney, to convert the investigatory proceeding to one supervised by an Investigating Court. The application was filed to expedite efforts by Global to obtain relief from the Sequestration Orders. Counsel anticipates that the Court will issue orders shortly approving the application and naming a court expert to complete the investigation.

Counsel advises that the court expert will inspect the facility to determine whether the design and construction are appropriate to enable it to operate in compliance with the terms of its air permit. Once the inspection is complete, the expert will issue a report to the Court presenting findings on this issue. Counsel advises that this process can take from 60 to 90 days to complete. The Deputy Prosecutor recently advised counsel that she will work collaboratively with the Global to expedite the inspections and, once they are complete, to work collaboratively to obtain interim relief from the Sequestration Orders in advance of the final report to complete required maintenance. Assuming interim relief is obtained, Global anticipates that the facility will be authorized to resume commercial operations around June 2007, however no assurances can be given.

Global is currently evaluating a potential claim against CGGP under the Services Agreement for damages arising from the alleged wrongdoing.

Electroandes

In July 2005, Electroandes received a notice from Superintendencia Nacional de Administracion Tributaria (SUNAT), the governing tax authority in Peru, claiming past due taxes for 2002 totaling
  approximately $2 million related to certain interest deductions. Electroandes has taken similar interest deductions subsequent to 2002. The total cumulative estimated potential amount for past due taxes,
  including associated interest and penalties, is approximately $9 million through December 31, 2006. Electroandes believes it has valid legal defenses to these claims, and has filed an appeal with SUNAT to
  which it has not yet received a response; however, no assurances can be given regarding the outcome of this matter.

Luz del Sur

In January 2007, SUNAT filed two tax assessments against LDS totaling approximately $18 million, of which Global’s share would be approximately $7 million based on its 38% interest of LDS. The assessments
  related to deductions LDS claimed beginning in 2000 for certain operating fees it paid to International Technical Operators under a technical services agreement, for certain bad debt deductions, and certain other matters.
  The above assessments include interest and penalties claimed by SUNAT. LDS believes that all such deductions were appropriate and filed an appeal in February 2007. LDS has obtained a legal opinion
  that it could be successful in most of the major matters, while in some relatively smaller items SUNAT’s views could prevail which could lead to an immaterial amount of exposure. However, no assurances
  can be given and negative outcomes in any of the major matters could have a material adverse impact on Global’s results of operations and cash flows.

New Generation and Development

Power

Power has contracts with outside parties to purchase upgraded turbines for Salem Units 1 and 2 and to purchase upgraded turbines and complete a power uprate for Hope Creek to modestly increase its
  generating capacity. Phase II of the Salem Unit 2 turbine replacement is currently scheduled for 2008 concurrent with steam generator replacement and is anticipated to increase capacity by 26 MW. Phase
  II of the Hope Creek turbine replacement is expected to be completed in 2007 along with the thermal power uprate and is expected to add approximately 125 MW. Power’s expenditures to date
  approximate $220 million (including Interest Capitalized During Construction (IDC) of $21 million) with an aggregate estimated share of total costs for these projects of $245 million (including IDC of $24
  million). Timing, costs and results of these


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

projects are dependent on timely completion of work, timely approval from the NRC and various other factors.

Completion of the projects discussed above within the estimated time frames and cost estimates cannot be assured. Construction delays, cost increases and various other factors could result in changes
  in the operational dates or ultimate costs to complete.

Power entered into a long-term contractual services agreement with a vendor in September 2003 to provide the outage and service needs for certain of Power’s generating units at market rates. The
  contract covers approximately 25 years and could result in annual payments ranging from approximately $10 million to $50 million for services, parts and materials rendered.

BGS and Basic Gas Supply Service (BGSS)

PSE&G and Power

PSE&G is required to obtain all electric supply requirements for customers who do not purchase electric supply from third-party suppliers through the annual New Jersey BGS auctions. PSE&G enters into
  the Supplier Master Agreement (SMA) with the winners of these BGS auctions within three business days following the BPU’s approval. PSE&G has entered into contracts with Power, as well as with other
  winning BGS suppliers, to purchase BGS for PSE&G’s anticipated load requirements. The winners of the auction are responsible for fulfilling all the requirements of a PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM)
  Load Serving Entity (LSE) including capacity, energy, ancillary services, transmission and any other services required by PJM. BGS suppliers assume any migration risk and must satisfy New Jersey’s
  renewable portfolio standards.

Through the BGS auctions, PSE&G has contracted for its anticipated BGS-Fixed Price load, as follows:

Power seeks to mitigate volatility in its results by contracting in advance for its anticipated electric output as well as its anticipated fuel needs.

As part of its objective, Power has entered into contracts to directly supply PSE&G and other New Jersey Electric Distribution Companies (EDCs) with a portion of their respective BGS requirements
  through the New Jersey BGS auction process, described above. In addition to the BGS-related contracts, Power enters into firm supply contracts with EDCs, as well as other firm sales and trading positions
  and commitments.

PSE&G has a full requirements contract with Power to meet the gas supply requirements of PSE&G’s gas customers. The contract extends through March 31, 2012, and year-to-year thereafter. Power has
  entered into hedges for a portion of its anticipated BGSS obligations, as permitted by the BPU. The BPU permits recovery of the cost of gas hedging up to 115 billion cubic feet or approximately 80% of
  PSE&G’s residential gas supply annually through the BGSS tariff. For additional information, see Note 21. Related-Party Transactions.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Minimum Fuel Purchase Requirements

Power

Power purchases coal and oil for certain of its fossil generation stations through various long-term commitments. The total minimum purchase requirements included in these commitments amount to
  approximately $733 million through 2012.

Power has several long-term purchase contracts for the supply of nuclear fuel for the Salem and Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Stations which include:

•

purchase of uranium (concentrates and uranium hexafluoride),

•

conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride,

•

enrichment of uranium hexafluoride, and

•

fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies.

The nuclear fuel markets are competitive, and although prices for uranium, conversion and enrichment are increasing, Power does not anticipate any significant problems in meeting its future
  requirements.

Uranium concentrates and hexafluoride

Power has commitments and inventory to supply sufficient quantities of uranium (concentrates and uranium hexafluoride) to meet 100% of its total requirements through 2011. Additionally, Power has
  commitments covering approximately 55% of its requirements for 2012 and 15% from 2013 through 2016. These commitments total approximately $464 million through the period of which Power’s share is
  approximately $332 million. Power has decided to maintain strategic levels of concentrates and uranium hexafluoride in inventory and may make periodic purchases to support such levels.

Power also has commitments that provide 100% of its uranium enrichment requirements through 2010. These commitments total approximately $198 million through the period of which Power’s share
  is $146 million.

Power has commitments for the fabrication of fuel assemblies for reloads required through 2011 for Salem and through 2012 for Hope Creek. These commitments total approximately $122 million
  through the period of which Power’s share is $93 million.

Power has been advised by Exelon Generation that it has similar purchase contracts to satisfy the fuel requirements for Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station.

Natural Gas

In addition to its fuel requirements, Power has entered into various multi-year contracts for firm transportation and storage capacity for natural gas, primarily to meet its gas supply obligations to PSE&G.
  As of December 31, 2005, the total minimum requirements under these contracts were approximately $1.2 billion through 2016.

These purchase obligations are in keeping with Power’s strategy to enter into contracts for its fuel supply in comparable volumes to its sales contracts.

Energy Holdings

The Guadalupe and Odessa plants of Texas Independent Energy, L.P. (TIE), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Holdings, have entered into gas supply agreements for their anticipated fuel
  requirements to satisfy obligations under their forward energy sales contracts. As of December 31, 2006, the Guadalupe and Odessa plants, which total approximately 2,000 MW of capacity, had forward
  energy sales contracts in place for approximately 30% of their expected output for 2007 and the sale of approximately 20% of their aggregate capacity for 2008 through 2010. The plants had fuel purchase
  commitments totaling $64 million to support all of their contracted energy sales.

Operating Services Contract (OSC)

Power

On January 17, 2005, Nuclear entered into an OSC with Exelon Generation relating to the operation of the Hope Creek and Salem nuclear generating stations. The OSC requires Exelon Generation to
  provide key


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

personnel to oversee daily plant operations at the Hope Creek and Salem nuclear generating stations and to implement a management model that Exelon has used to manage its own nuclear facilities.
  Nuclear continues as the license holder with exclusive legal authority to operate and maintain the plants, retains responsibility for management oversight and has full authority with respect to the marketing
  of its share of the output from the facilities. Exelon Generation is entitled to receive reimbursement of its costs in discharging its obligations, an annual operating services fee of $3 million and incentive fees
  up to $12 million annually based on attainment of goals relating to safety, capacity factor and operation and maintenance expenses. On October 27, 2006, Nuclear informed Exelon Generation that it was
  electing to continue to OSC for up to two years beyond the initial January 2007 period.

In December 2006, Power announced its plans to resume direct management of the Salem and Hope Creek nuclear generating stations before the expiration of the OSC. As part of this plan, on January
  1, 2007, the senior management team at Salem and Hope Creek, which consisted of three senior executives from Exelon Generation, became employees of Power.

BPU Deferral Audit

The BPU Energy and Audit Division conducts audits of deferred balances. A draft Deferral Audit—Phase II report relating to the 12-month period ended July 31, 2003 was released by the consultant to
  the BPU in April 2005. The draft report addresses the SBC, Market Transition Charge (MTC) and NUG deferred balances. The BPU released the report on May 13, 2005.

While the consultant to the BPU found that the Phase II deferral balances complied in all material respects with the BPU Orders regarding such deferrals, the consultant noted that the BPU Staff had
  raised certain questions with respect to the reconciliation method PSE&G employed in calculating the overrecovery of its MTC and other charges during the Phase I and Phase II four-year transition period.
  The amount in dispute is approximately $130 million. PSE&G and the BPU Staff are continuing discussions to resolve these questions and, if a resolution cannot be achieved, a BPU proceeding may be
  instituted to consider the issues raised.

On January 31, 2007 PSE&G requested that the matter be transmitted to the Office of Administrative Law for the development of an evidentiary record and an initial decision. The BPU granted the
  request on February 7, 2007.

While PSE&G believes the MTC methodology it used was fully litigated and resolved, without exception, by the BPU and other intervening parties in its previous electric base rate case, deferral audit
  and deferral proceeding that were approved by the BPU in its order on April 22, 2004, and that such order is non-appealable, PSE&G cannot predict the impact of the outcome of any such proceeding.

New Jersey Clean Energy Program

The BPU has approved a funding requirement for each New Jersey utility applicable to its Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency programs for the years 2005 to 2008. The sum of PSE&G’s electric
  and gas funding requirement was $82 million and $96 million for the years 2005 and 2006 respectively. The remaining liability, $119 million for 2007 and $137 million for 2008, has been recorded at a
  discounted present value with an offsetting regulatory asset. The costs associated with this program will be recovered from PSE&G ratepayers through the SBC over a period of four years and, therefore, a
  Regulatory Asset was also recorded. The liability for the funding requirement as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 was $253 million and $329 million, respectively.

PSEG and Energy Holdings

Leveraged Lease Investments

On November 16, 2006, the IRS issued its Revenue Agents report for tax years 1997 through 2000, which disallowed all deductions associated with certain of lease transactions that are similar to a type
  that the IRS


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

publicly announced its intention to challenge. In addition, the IRS imposed a 20% penalty for substantial understatement of tax liability. In February 2007, PSEG filed a protest to the Office of Appeals of
  the IRS. As of each of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, Resources’ total gross investment in such transactions was approximately $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.

If all deductions associated with these lease transactions, entered into by PSEG between 1997 and 2002, are successfully challenged by the IRS, it could have a material adverse impact on PSEG’s and
  Energy Holdings’ financial position, results of operations and net cash flows and could impact future returns on these transactions. PSEG believes that its tax position related to these transactions is proper
  based on applicable statutes, regulations and case law and will aggressively contest the IRS’s disallowance. PSEG believes that it is more likely than not that it will prevail with respect to the IRS’s challenge,
  although no assurances can be given.

If the IRS’s disallowance of tax benefits associated with all of these lease transactions were sustained, approximately $773 million of PSEG’s deferred tax liabilities that have been recorded under
  leveraged lease accounting through December 31, 2006 would become currently payable. In addition, interest of approximately $124 million, after-tax would be charged, and penalties of $155 million may
  become payable. Management assessed the probability of various outcomes to this matter and recorded appropriate reserves in accordance with SFAS No. 5 “Accounting for Contingencies.” Management
  has also prepared various sensitivity analyses regarding potential payment obligations, including scenarios that consider the current position of the IRS regarding these types of listed transactions, and
  believes that Energy Holdings has the financial capacity to meet such potential obligations, if required.

The FASB recently issued additional guidance for leveraged leases. See Note 2. Recent Accounting Standards for additional information.

Power

Restructuring Charge

In June 2005, Power implemented a plan, approved by management, to reduce its Nuclear workforce by approximately 200 positions. The plan includes voluntary and involuntary separations offered to
  both represented and non-represented employees. The major cost associated with the restructuring relates to payments to the employees who are terminated. Power’s $14 million share of the estimated total
  cost was recorded in 2005, substantially all of which had been paid as of December 31, 2006.

Note 13. Nuclear Decommissioning

Power

In accordance with NRC regulations, entities owning an interest in nuclear generating facilities are required to determine the costs and funding methods necessary to decommission such facilities upon
  termination of operation. As a general practice, each nuclear owner places funds in independent external trust accounts it maintains to provide for decommissioning.

Power maintains the external master nuclear decommissioning trust previously established by PSE&G. This trust contains two separate funds: a qualified fund and a non-qualified fund. Section 468A of
  the Internal Revenue Code limits the amount of money that can be contributed into a “qualified” fund. In the most recent study of the total cost of decommissioning, Power’s share related to its five nuclear
  units was estimated at approximately $2.1 billion, including contingencies.

Power’s policy is that, except for investments tied to market indexes or other non-nuclear sector common trust funds or mutual funds (e.g., an S&P 500 mutual fund), assets of the trust shall not be
  invested in the securities or other obligations of PSEG or its affiliates, or its successors or assigns; and assets shall not be invested in securities of any entity owning one or more nuclear power plants.

Power classifies investments in the NDT Funds as available-for-sale under SFAS 115. The following tables show the fair values and gross unrealized gains and losses for the securities held in the NDT

In 2006, other-than-temporary impairments of $8 million and $6 million were recognized on $59 million of equity and $152 million of debt securities, respectively, that were included in the Estimated
  Fair Value of NDT Funds as of December 31, 2006.

Net realized gains of $44 million were recognized in Other Income and Other Deductions on Power’s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. Net unrealized gains
  of $108 million (after-tax) were recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss on Power’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006. The $3 million of gross 2006 unrealized losses has
  been in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months. The available-for-sale debt securities held as of December 31, 2006, had the following maturities: $18 million less than one year, $108 million
  one to five years, $97 million five to 10 years, $48 million 10 to 15 years, $21 million 15 to 20 years, and $140 million over 20 years. The cost of these securities was determined on the basis of specific
  identification.

The fair value of securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2006 was approximately $39 million. If the fair market value of the securities falls below cost, the investments are
  considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The difference between the fair market value and cost is immediately recorded as a charge to earnings since Power does not definitely have the ability and
  intent to hold the securities for a reasonable time to permit recovery. Any subsequent recoveries in the value of these securities are recognized in OCI. The assessment of fair market value compared to cost is applied on a weighted average basis taking into account various purchase dates and initial cost detail of the securities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

Each of PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings provide deferred taxes at the enacted statutory tax rate for all temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax
  bases of existing assets and liabilities irrespective of the treatment for rate-making purposes. Management believes that it is probable that the accumulated tax benefits that previously have been treated as a
  flow-through item to PSE&G customers will be recovered from PSE&G’s customers in the future. Accordingly, an offsetting regulatory asset was established. As of December 31, 2006, PSE&G had a regulatory
  asset of $412 million representing the tax costs expected to be recovered through rates based upon established regulatory practices, which permit recovery of current taxes payable. This amount was
  determined using the enacted Federal income tax rate of 35% and State income tax rate of 9%.

Energy Holdings’ effective tax rate differs from the statutory Federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the imposition of state taxes and the fact that Global accounts for many of its investments
  using the equity method of accounting. In addition, as allowed under APB Opinion No. 23, “Accounting for Income Taxes—Special Areas” and SFAS 109, Management generally has maintained a permanent
  reinvestment strategy as it relates to Global’s international investments. If Management were to change that strategy, a deferred tax expense and deferred tax liability would need to be recorded to reflect
  the expected taxes that would need to be paid on Global’s offshore earnings. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, undistributed foreign earnings were approximately $80 million and $220 million,
  respectively. During 2006, the reinvestment strategy for three of Global’s investments was modified, resulting in a deferred tax expense of $7 million. The determination of the amount of unrecognized U.S.
  Federal deferred income tax liability for undistributed earnings is not practicable.

The 2005 Jobs Act provided a one-year window to repatriate earnings from foreign investments and claim a special 85% dividends received tax deduction on such distributions. PSEG approved a total
  of three Domestic Reinvestment Plans, which provided for the repatriation of approximately $242 million through December 2005, of which approximately $177 million was eligible for the reduced tax rate
  pursuant to the Jobs Act. The tax expense associated with such repatriation totaled approximately $11 million and was recorded in 2005. Other than amounts discussed above, Global has made no change in
  its current intention to indefinitely reinvest accumulated earnings of its foreign subsidiaries.

Note 16. Pension, OPEB and Savings Plans

PSEG

PSEG sponsors several qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans covering PSEG’s, and its participating affiliates, current and former employees who meet certain
  eligibility criteria. Eligible employees of PSE&G, Power, Energy Holdings and Services participate in non-contributory pension and OPEB plans sponsored by PSEG and administered by Services. In
  addition, represented and nonrepresented employees are eligible for participation in PSEG’s two defined contribution plans described below.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158 (see Note 2. Recent Accounting Standards), which became effective prospectively for periods ending after December 15, 2006. In accordance with SFAS
  158, PSEG, Power, PSE&G and Energy Holdings were required to record the under or over funded positions of their defined benefit pension and OPEB plans on their respective balance sheets. Such funding
  positions were measured as of December 31, 2006 in compliance with SFAS 158 and in accordance with customary practice of each PSEG company prior to the issuance of SFAS 158. For under funded
  plans, the liability is equal to the difference between the plan’s benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation
  (PBO). For OPEB plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. In addition, the statement requires that the total unrecognized costs for defined benefit pension and
  OPEB plans be recorded as an after-tax charge to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, a separate component of Stockholder’s Equity. However, for PSE&G, because the amortization of the
  unrecognized costs is being collected from customers, the accumulated unrecognized costs were recorded as a Regulatory Asset. The unrecognized costs represent actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs
  and transition obligations arising from the adoption of the preceding pension and OPEB accounting standards, which have not been expensed.

Prior accounting guidance required that unrecognized costs be presented in a footnote to the financial statements as part of a reconciliation of a plan’s funded status to amounts recorded in the financial
  statements. The unrecognized costs are amortized as a component of net periodic pension or OPEB expense. Under the new standard, for Power and Energy Holdings, the charge to Other Comprehensive
  Income will be amortized and recorded as net periodic pension cost in the Statement of Operations. For PSE&G, the Regulatory Asset will be amortized and recorded as net periodic pension cost in the
  Statement of Operations.

The following presents the impact of applying the provisions of SFAS 158 on the Balance Sheet of PSEG as of December 31, 2006:

The following table provides a roll-forward of the changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets during each of the two years in the periods ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. It also
  provides the funded status of the plans and the amounts recognized and amounts not recognized in the Statement of Financial Position at the end of both years. Because December 31, 2006 balances reflect
  the recognition and disclosure requirements of SFAS 158, and December 31, 2005 balances reflect the requirements of prior accounting standards, the Reconciliation of Funded Status found below applies

PSEG utilizes an independent pension consultant to forecast returns, risk, and correlation of all asset classes in order to develop an optimal portfolio, which is designed to produce the maximum return
  opportunity per unit of risk. In 2002, PSEG completed its latest asset/liability study. The results from the study indicated that, in order to achieve the optimal risk/return portfolio, target allocations of 62%
  equity securities, 30% fixed income securities, 5% real estate investments, and 3% for other investments should be maintained. Derivative financial instruments are used by the plans’ investment managers
  primarily to rebalance the fixed income/equity allocation of the portfolio and hedge the currency risk component of the foreign investments.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8.75% as of December 31, 2006. For 2007, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will remain at 8.75%. This expected return was
  determined based on the study discussed above and considered the plans’ historical annualized rate of return since inception of the plans, which was an annualized return of 10.3%.

Plan Contributions

PSEG may contribute up to $70 million into its qualified pension plans and postretirement healthcare plan for calendar year 2007.

Cash Flows

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

The following pension benefit and postretirement benefit payments are expected to be paid to plan participants. Postretirement benefit payments are shown both gross and net of the federal subsidy
  expected for prescription drugs under the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. The Act provides a nontaxable federal subsidy to employers that provide retiree
  prescription drug benefits that are equivalent to the benefits of Medicare Part D.

Rabbi Trusts

PSEG maintains certain unfunded, nonqualified benefit plans for which certain assets have been set aside in grantor trusts commonly known as “Rabbi Trusts” to provide supplemental retirement and
  deferred compensation benefits to certain of its and its subsidiaries’ key employees and directors.

Effective January 1, 2003, PSEG began accounting for the assets in the Rabbi Trusts under SFAS 115. PSEG classifies investments in the Rabbi Trusts as available-for-sale under SFAS 115. The
  following tables show the fair values, gross unrealized gains and losses and amortized cost bases for the securities held in the Rabbi Trusts.

Note 17. Stock Based Compensation

PSEG

As approved at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2004, PSEG’s 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2004 LTIP) replaced prior Long-Term Incentive Plans (the 1989 LTIP and 2001 LTIP). The 2004
  LTIP is a broad-based equity compensation program that provides for grants of various long-term incentive compensation awards, such as stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares,
  restricted stock, cash awards or any combination thereof. The types of long-term incentive awards that have been granted and remain outstanding under the LTIPs are non-qualified options to purchase
  shares of PSEG’s common stock, restricted stock awards and performance unit awards. However, since 2004 through December 31, 2006, only restricted stock has been granted.

The 2004 LTIP currently provides for the issuance of equity awards with respect to approximately 13 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2006, there were approximately 11.9 million
  shares available for future awards under the 2004 LTIP.

Stock Options

Under the 2004 LTIP, non-qualified options to acquire shares of PSEG common stock may be granted to officers and other key employees of PSEG and its subsidiaries selected by the Organization
  and Compensation Committee of PSEG’s Board of Directors, the plan’s administrative committee (Committee). Option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of PSEG’s
  common stock at the grant date. The options generally vest based on three to five years of continuous service. Vesting schedules may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a change-
  in-control, retirement, death or disability. Options are exercisable over a period of time designated by the Committee (but not prior to one year or longer than 10 years from the date of grant) and are
  subject to such other terms and conditions as the Committee determines. Payment by option holders upon exercise of an option may be made in cash or, with the consent of the Committee, by delivering
  previously acquired shares of PSEG common stock.

On September 1, 2006, PSEG began using treasury stock to settle the exercise of stock options. Prior to September 1, 2006, PSEG had purchased shares on the open market to meet the exercise of
  stock options. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, PSEG paid out approximately $46 million, $72 million and $13 million, respectively, to settle the exercise of stock options.

Restricted Stock

Under the 2004 LTIP, PSEG has granted restricted stock awards to officers and other key employees. These shares are subject to risk of forfeiture until vested by continued employment. Restricted
  stock generally vests annually over three years, but is considered outstanding at the time of grant, as the recipients are entitled to dividends and voting rights. Vesting may be accelerated upon certain
  events, such as change in control (unless substituted with an equity award of equal value), retirement, death or disability.

In addition, from 1998 to 2001, PSEG granted 210,000 shares of restricted stock to a key executive, which are subject to risk of forfeiture until vested by continued employment. The shares vest on a
  staggered schedule through March 2007.

PSEG issues restricted stock from treasury stock.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Performance Units

Under the 2004 LTIP, performance units were granted to certain key executives, which provide for payment in shares of PSEG common stock based on achievement of certain financial goals over the
  three-year period from 2004 through 2006. The payout varies from 0% to 200% of the number of performance units granted depending on PSEG’s performance compared to the performance of other
  companies in the Dow Jones Utilities Index. The performance units are credited with dividend equivalents in an amount equal to dividends paid on PSEG common stock up until January 1, 2007. Vesting
  may be accelerated upon certain events such as change in control, retirement, death or disability.

Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, PSEG adopted SFAS 123R. See Note 2. Recent Accounting Standards for a description of the adoption of SFAS 123R. As a result, all outstanding unvested stock options as
  of January 1, 2006 are being expensed based on their grant date fair values, which were determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Stock option awards are expensed on a tranche-specific
  basis over the requisite service period of the award. Ultimately, compensation expense for stock options is recognized for awards that vest.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, PSEG recognized compensation expense for restricted stock over the vesting period based on the grant date fair market value of the shares. PSEG will continue to
  recognize compensation expense over the vesting term.

Also prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, PSEG recognized compensation expense for performance units. The fair value of each performance unit was based on the grant date fair value of PSEG
  common stock. The accrual of compensation cost was based on the probable achievement of the performance conditions, which result in a payout from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. The current accrual is
  estimated at 100% of the original grant. The accrual is adjusted for subsequent changes in the estimated or actual outcome.

Compensation cost from options, restricted stock and performance units is included in Operation and Maintenance Expense on PSEG’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and amounted to
  approximately $17 million, $6 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized on PSEG’s Consolidated Statements of
  Operations was approximately $7 million, $3 and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Compensation cost capitalized as part of Property, Plant and Equipment was
  less than $1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Of the total compensation cost for the years ended December 31, 2006, approximately $1 million, after-tax, related to the
  adoption of SFAS 123R, which was primarily due to expensing stock options for the first time. There was no impact on basic and diluted earnings per share from the implementation of SFAS 123R because
  there were a relatively small number of outstanding unvested stock options as of the implementation date.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, PSEG presented all tax benefits for deductions resulting from the exercise of share-based compensation as operating cash flows on the Consolidated Statement of
  Cash Flows. SFAS 123R requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the taxes expensed on recognized compensation cost to be reported as financing cash flows. There was approximately $15 million,
  $30 million and $5 million of excess tax benefits included as a financing cash inflow on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Total
  cash flow will remain unchanged from what would have been reported under prior accounting rules.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following table illustrates the effect on Net Income and earnings per share if PSEG had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R for the years ended December 31, 2005 and
  2004.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, PSEG recognized the compensation cost of stock based awards issued to retirement eligible employees that fully or partially vest upon an employee’s retirement
  over the nominal vesting period of performance, and recognized any remaining compensation cost at the date of retirement. In accordance with SFAS 123R, PSEG recognizes compensation cost of awards
  issued after January 1, 2006 over the shorter of the original vesting period or the period beginning on the date of grant and ending on the date an individual is eligible for retirement and the award vests.

There were no options granted during 2005 or 2006. Changes in stock options for the years ended December 31, 2006 are summarized as follows:

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. There were no options granted during 2006. The following weighted average
  assumptions were used for grants in 2004: expected volatility of 26.74%, risk-free interest rate of 3.09%, expected life of 4.0 years. There was a weighted average dividend yield of 5.00% in 2004.

The intrinsic value of options is the difference between the current market price and the exercise price. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
  and 2004 was approximately $56 million, $72 million and $13 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, cash received from stock options exercised was approximately
  $86 million, $141 million and $59 million, respectively. The tax benefit realized from stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was approximately $13 million, $29
  million and $5 million, respectively.

Approximately 1 million options vested during each of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The weighted average fair value per share for options vested during the years
  ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $41.15, $38.26 and $36.54 respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, there was less than $1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of eight months.

The total intrinsic value of restricted stock vested during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $2 million and $1 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, there was approximately $14 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7
  years.

Performance Units Information

In May 2004, 94,400 performance units were granted to certain key executives, which provide for payment in shares of PSEG Common Stock based on achievement of certain financial goals over the
  2004 through 2006 three-year period. The number of units outstanding and unvested as of January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006 was 83,600 and 82,700, respectively. 11,700 units were forfeited in 2005 and
  900 in 2006. Approximately 9,500 dividend equivalents had accrued on these performance units. The grant date fair value of the performance units is $42.75 per unit.

Assuming performance units are paid out at the 100% performance level, the total intrinsic value of performance units outstanding as of December 31, 2006 was approximately $6
  million.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Outside Directors

During 2006, each director who was not an officer of PSEG or its subsidiaries and affiliates was paid an annual retainer of $50,000. Pursuant to the Compensation Plan for Outside Directors, 50% of the
  annual retainer was paid in PSEG common stock.

PSEG also maintains a Stock Plan for Outside Directors (Stock Plan) pursuant to which directors of PSEG who are not employees of PSEG or its subsidiaries receive a restricted stock award, currently
  1,000 shares per year, for each year of service as a director. The restrictions on the stock granted under the Stock Plan provide that the shares are subject to forfeiture if the director leaves service at any
  time prior to the Annual Meeting of Stockholders following his or her 72nd birthday. This restriction would be deemed to have been satisfied if the director’s service were terminated after a “change in
  control” as defined in the Stock Plan or if the director were to die in office. PSEG also has the ability to waive this restriction for good cause shown. Restricted stock may not be sold or otherwise
  transferred prior to the lapse of the restrictions. Dividends on shares held subject to restrictions are paid directly to the director who has the right to vote the shares. The fair value of these shares is recorded
  as compensation expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Compensation expense for the Stock Plan for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $1 million
  and less than $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

PSEG maintains an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees of PSEG and its subsidiaries. Under the plan, shares of PSEG common stock may be purchased at 95% of the fair market
  value through payroll deductions. In any year, employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 10% of their base pay. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, employees
  purchased 60,351, 76,729, and 99,712 shares at an average price of $61.63, $54.00 and $40.59 per share, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, 1.8 million shares were available for future issuance under this
  plan.

Note 18. Financial Information by Business Segment

Basis of Organization

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

The reportable segments were determined by management in accordance with SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information” (SFAS 131). These segments
  were determined based on how management measures performance based on segment Net Income, as illustrated in the following table, and how it allocates resources to each business.

PSE&G

PSE&G earns revenue from its tariffs, under which it provides electric transmission and electric and gas distribution services to residential, commercial and industrial customers in New Jersey. The rates
  charged for electric transmission are regulated by FERC while the rates charged for electric and gas distribution are regulated by the BPU. Revenues are also earned from several other activities such as
  sundry sales, the appliance service business, wholesale transmission services and other miscellaneous services.

Power

Power earns revenues by selling energy, capacity and ancillary services on a wholesale basis under contract to power marketers and to load serving entities and by bidding energy, capacity and ancillary
  services into the markets for these products. Power also enters into trading contracts for energy, capacity, firm transmission rights, gas, emission allowances and other energy-related contracts to optimize the
  value of its portfolio of generating assets and its electric and gas supply obligations.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Energy Holdings

Global

Global earns revenues from its investment in and operation of projects in the generation and distribution of energy, both domestically and internationally. Global has ownership interests in three
  distribution companies and in electric generation facilities which sell energy, capacity and ancillary services to numerous customers. The generation plants sell power under long-term agreements as well as
  on a merchant basis while the distribution companies are rate-regulated enterprises. Revenues include revenues of consolidated investments. Gains and losses on sales of investments are typically recognized
  in revenues.

Resources

Resources earns revenues from its passive investments in leveraged leases, limited partnerships, leveraged buyout funds and marketable securities. Approximately 95% of Resources’ investments are in
  leveraged leases. DSM investments earn revenues primarily from monthly payments from utilities, representing shared electricity savings from the installation of energy efficient
  equipment. Resources operates both domestically and internationally; however, revenues from all international investments are denominated in U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on sales of investments are
  typically recognized in revenues.

Other

Energy Holdings’ other activities include amounts applicable to Energy Holdings (parent company). The net losses primarily relate to financing and certain administrative and general costs at the
  Energy Holdings parent corporation.

Other

PSEG’s other activities include amounts applicable to PSEG (parent corporation), and intercompany eliminations, primarily relating to intercompany transactions between Power and PSE&G. No gains
  or losses are recorded on any intercompany transactions; rather, all intercompany transactions are at cost or, in the case of the BGS and BGSS contracts between Power and PSE&G, at rates prescribed by
  the BPU. For a further discussion of the intercompany transactions between Power and PSE&G, see Note 21. Related-Party Transactions. The net losses primarily relate to financing and certain
  administrative and general costs at the PSEG parent corporation.

Note 23. Subsequent Events

Energy Holdings:

Global

From about 1995 through 2001, Global and its partners expended approximately $12 million towards the construction of a power plant in the Konya-Ilgin region of Turkey. In 2001, Turkey passed
  legislation and otherwise deprived Global of rights and fair and equitable treatment and expropriated Global’s Concession contract for the power plant project without compensation, despite the Turkish
  Government’s obligation to compensate Global for its costs under the existing contract and Turkish law. In 2002, Global initiated arbitration before the International Centre for Settlement of International
  Disputes seeking return of sunk costs, lost profits, interest and attorney fees and costs. A decision in this matter was made in January 2007 under which the Turkish Government will be required to pay
  approximately $20 million for sunk costs, interest and arbitration fees. After legal contingency fees, Global expects to receive approximately $7 million, after tax, for its share of the project. Global
  expects to receive payment in the second quarter of 2007.

Resources

In 2001, Resources made an investment of $14 million in a collateralized bond obligation fund (CBO fund) which was managed by Credit Suisse First Boston LLC and Credit Suisse First Boston
  (Europe) Limited (collectively, CSFB). Resources was an equal 33% partner in the CBO fund with the CIT Group and Dana. In 2002, the CBO fund was liquidated and Resources recovered a portion of its
  original investment. Resources and its partners filed claims against CSFB for lost interest and principal of its investment. The case was settled in January 2007 and Resources received $11 million, recording
  an after-tax gain of approximately $4 million.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating to
  each company, including their respective consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of each company by others within those entities. PSEG, PSE&G,
  Power and Energy Holdings have established a disclosure committee which is made up of several key management employees and which reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive
  Officer of each respective company. The committee monitors and evaluates the effectiveness of these disclosure controls and procedures. The Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer of each
  company have evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2006 and, based on this evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were
  effective in providing reasonable assurance during the period covered in these annual reports.

Internal Controls

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings

PSEG has conducted an assessment of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Management’s report on PSEG’s
  internal control over financial reporting is included on page 194. The Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm’s report with respect to management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal
  control over financial reporting and the effectiveness of PSEG’s internal control over financial reporting is included on page 195. Management has concluded that internal control over financial reporting is
  effective as of December 31, 2006.

PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings continually review their respective disclosure controls and procedures and make changes, as necessary, to ensure the quality of their financial reporting.
  However, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2006 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
  each registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of
  internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the SEC in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by,
  or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and implemented by the company’s management and other personnel,
  with oversight by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
  purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (generally accepted accounting principles).

PSEG’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
  transactions and dispositions of PSEG’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
  accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of PSEG are being made only in accordance with authorizations of PSEG’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable
  assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of PSEG’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

In connection with the preparation of PSEG’s annual financial statements, management of PSEG has undertaken an assessment, which includes the design and operational effectiveness of PSEG’s
  internal control over financial reporting using the framework promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, commonly referred to as “COSO”. The COSO
  framework is based upon five integrated components of control: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communications and ongoing monitoring.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projection of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the
  risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Based on the assessment performed, management has concluded that PSEG’s internal control over financial reporting is effective and provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of PSEG’s
  financial reporting and the preparation of its financial statements as of December 31, 2006 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Further, management has not identified any material
  weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006.

PSEG’s external auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, have audited PSEG’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this annual report on Form 10-K and, as part of that
  audit, have issued a report on management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting, a copy of which is included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

NCORPORATED

:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated and
  subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” issued by
  the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
  assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
  internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
  reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
  financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
  in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
  similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
  financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
  are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
  in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
  disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or
  fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that
  the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the
  criteria established in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
  material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of
  Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of
  and for the year ended December 31, 2006 of the Company, and our report dated February 27, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial
  statement schedule, and included explanatory paragraphs regarding the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
  Postretirement Plans” and Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations.”

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT

The Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of PSEG has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this Annual Report on Form 10-
  K with management and with Frederic W. Cook, Co., Inc., the Committee’s independent compensation consultant. Based on such review and discussions the Organization and Compensation Committee has

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PSEG and as such has no standing committees of its Board of Directors. Executive compensation is administered under the direction of the Organization
  and Compensation Committee (Committee) of PSEG, which oversees compensation programs and policies for PSEG and its subsidiaries. In light of responsibilities of the Committee, the Board of Directors
  of PSE&G does not believe it is necessary for it to have a separate committee of its own with respect to compensation


matters. The Committee is made up of directors who are independent under NYSE rules and the Company’s requirements for independent directors.

The executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table (NEOs) for PSE&G are as follows: Mr. Ferland, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), who is also the Chairman and
  CEO of PSEG; Mr. Izzo, who was President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) until September 30, 2006, after which he became President and COO of PSEG; Mr. LaRossa, the President and COO since
  October 1, 2006; Mr. Selover, the Executive Vice President and General Counsel, who is also the Executive Vice President and General Counsel of PSEG; Mr. Busch, the Senior Vice President and Chief
  Financial Officer, who retired effective January 18, 2007; and Ms. Rado, the Vice President and Controller, who retired effective January 2, 2007. Under the compensation program administered by the
  Committee, each NEO is compensated on the basis of all positions he or she holds with PSEG and its subsidiaries, including PSE&G. Mr. Ferland will retire from all positions within the PSEG family of
  companies effective March 31, 2007. At that time, Mr. Izzo will become the Chairman and CEO of PSEG and PSE&G.

Compensation Philosophy and Program

Our Executive Compensation Program (Program) is designed to attract, motivate and retain high performing executives who are critical to our long-term success. The Program is structured to link
  executive compensation to how successfully we execute our business plans and meet a number of corporate, financial and operational goals. This design is intended to provide executives increased
  compensation when we do well and to provide less compensation when we do not.

As discussed below under Committee Activity, the Committee has been engaged since the fourth quarter of 2006 in a comprehensive review of executive compensation, including an analysis of its
  compensation philosophy and its use of consultants.

The Committee’s general philosophy is to set compensation of executive officers at the median of compensation of a peer group of companies. The Committee’s specific policies and benchmarking are
  discussed below.

The Committee reviews the philosophy, goals and objectives of the Program at least annually. In assessing their continued appropriateness, the Committee examines our success and the contributions of
  the individual executives in achieving our business plans. The Committee considers the motivational impact of the Program as an incentive in attaining desired business results and in the continued ability to
  attract and retain high-quality executives. Key factors in judging whether the Program has met its goals are the Program’s relationship to our financial results, our future outlook and our ability to attract
  and retain key executive talent.

The Committee has the responsibility to review, approve and modify, as necessary, our Program and each of its constituent elements.

Compensation Consultant

In October 2006, the Committee engaged Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. (Cook) as its executive compensation consultant to perform a comprehensive review of PSEG’s approach to and delivery of executive
  compensation. The scope of the assignment also included review of the CEO’s and other executive officers’ specific compensation levels, including analysis of competitive market data and the mix of base
  salary, equity, incentive and other payments. The results of the review were used in setting executive officer compensation for 2007.

Cook does not and will not perform any other services for PSEG. Its only roles will be advising the Committee on executive compensation, and also the PSEG Corporate Governance Committee on
  matters pertaining to compensation of directors who are not executive officers. Responsibility for assignment to and evaluation of work by Cook is solely that of the Committee and, beginning in April 2007
  with respect to non-officer directors, the Corporate Governance Committee. In furtherance of Cook’s independence, management receives copies of certain materials provided by Cook to the Committee
  only after the materials have been provided to the Committee.

In setting executive base pay levels for 2006 and awards made in January 2006 for 2005 performance under the annual management incentive compensation program (MICP), the Committee utilized
  Hewitt Associates, Inc. (Hewitt) as its executive compensation consultant. Hewitt provided data as to executive


compensation trends and to assist in establishing the CEO’s compensation and in reviewing the CEO’s recommendations for the compensation of other executive officers.

PSEG pays the fees of the compensation consultants retained by the Committee. In addition, it has agreed to indemnify Cook for certain matters related to Cook’s engagement by the Committee, other
  than matters involving negligence or intentional misconduct by Cook.

Committee Activity

In setting 2006 and 2007 compensation, the Committee examined the following elements of compensation: base salary, award targets and performance criteria under the annual management incentive compensation
  plan (MICP) and equity and any other long-term incentive compensation awards under the long-term incentive compensation plan (LTIP).

Following Cook’s review of executive compensation, the Committee, in January 2007, considered the recommendations of Cook with regard to compensation design and effectiveness, compensation for
  the CEO and the NEOs, certain other officers and directors. As a result, the Committee determined to:

•

Change the peer group of companies (the peer groups appear below under Benchmarking) with respect to which executive compensation comparisons would be made to more closely align PSEG
      with its market contemporaries;

•

Change the form of long-term equity awards from one-third each for options, restricted stock and performance units (restricted stock only during the pendency of the proposed Exelon merger),
      to one-half each options and performance units for executive officers and one-half each performance units and restricted stock for other key employees;

•

Change the procedure for conveyance of the consultant’s compensation information so that the Committee would receive the data prior to management receiving it; and

•

Replace the PSEG Directors’ Stock Plan with a new equity compensation plan for outside directors.

The Committee also considered compensation recommendations for the NEOs made by the consultant and the CEO. Based on this review and the recommendations, the Committee, in conjunction
  with all the independent directors, established 2007 base compensation levels for the CEO and the COO of PSEG. The Committee also established the 2007 base compensation levels for the other NEOs
  and certain other officers based on recommendations by the CEO. Also in January 2007, the Committee certified the achievement of performance goals and determined the amounts earned and payable
  under the MICP with respect to 2006 performance.

In reviewing and establishing compensation levels for 2007, the Committee used the revised comparison peer group. The Committee’s decisions in determining compensation for 2006 and 2007, were
  made independent of prior equity awards, outstanding performance units, pensions or future compensation opportunities.

Compensation Policies

PSEG and the Committee have established compensation policies to implement the compensation philosophy stated above. To meet our compensation objectives and to focus executive efforts on
  improving corporate performance, the Committee has developed and currently administers pay delivery systems that fall into three broad categories:

•

Base salary;

•

Annual cash incentive compensation, including annual performance-based incentives; and

•

Long-term incentive compensation, including equity and performance awards, such as restricted stock, stock options and performance units.

Each of these elements of compensation, including our related policies regarding determination and evaluation, is discussed further below. Our policy is to provide a mix of these elements in the
  proportion best designed, as determined by the Committee, to achieve our compensation objectives. The Committee annually reviews the relationships among these elements, including cash, equity,
  performance-based pay, incentives, amount at risk and vesting schedules. The Committee does not have specific proportional factors it takes into account when establishing these elements.


In addition to the above elements of compensation, our practice has been to provide the following benefits (described more fully below) to non-represented employees generally, including the NEOs:

•

Post-employment and post-termination benefits, including defined benefit (pension) plans and severance and change-in-control benefits;

•

Health care programs;

•

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (for the purchase of PSEG Common Stock (Common Stock) at a 5% discount); and

•

A defined contribution (401(k)) plan (the Thrift Plan).

Executive and other key employees are provided with certain additional benefits, such as deferred compensation opportunities, enhanced post-employment benefits and a limited number of perquisites,
  in amounts deemed appropriate by the Committee and management based on the individual’s position and ability to contribute to achievement of our business goals.

Except for certain employment agreements with senior managers, described below, or with respect to certain benefits resulting from a termination of employment following a change in control for
  certain executive officers covered under PSEG’s Key Executive Severance Plan, also described below, we generally do not provide a tax gross-up of benefit amounts deemed to be taxable income under
  federal or state income tax laws and regulations.

Role of Executive Officers

The CEO attends Committee meetings, other than executive sessions, generally acting as Secretary for the Committee. Other executive officers and internal compensation professionals may attend portions of Committee
  meetings. The CEO recommends the compensation of his direct reports within an overall base salary budget and the Committee considers these recommendations in the context of the peer group. This
  includes base salary, incentive compensation targets for the MICP and the LTIP, goals and objectives and performance evaluation. Management’s data provided to the Committee generally includes a
  recommendation with respect to CEO compensation which, historically, has reflected the average base compensation adjustment and average MICP multiplier of other officers.

The design and effectiveness of compensation policies and programs are reviewed by the CEO periodically in light of general industry and peer trends, and recommendations for changes are made to
  the Committee as deemed advisable by the CEO. The CEO reviews such compensation matters with our internal compensation professionals and other consultants. The Committee believes that the role
  played by the CEO in this process is reasonable and appropriate because the CEO is best suited to evaluate the performance of his direct reports.

Benchmarking

As an important element, the Committee sets executive cash compensation so as to be competitive with other large energy services corporations.

The Committee looks at each element of cash compensation within the peer group as well as total compensation within the peer group. General industry data is also taken into consideration for certain
  positions where the talent pool falls outside of the energy sector. Such positions may include the finance, human resources, accounting and information technology fields. For 2006, the following peer group
  was used:

AES Corporation

Ameren Corporation

American Electric Power Company, Inc.

CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

CMS Energy Corporation

Consolidated Edison, Inc.

Constellation Energy Group, Inc.

Dominion Resources, Inc.

DTE Energy Company

Duke Energy Corporation

Edison International

Entergy Corporation

Exelon Corporation

FirstEnergy Corp.

FPL Group, Inc.

JEA

ONEOK, Inc.

PG&E Corporation

Pepco Holdings, Inc.

PPL Corporation

Progress Energy, Inc.

Reliant Resources, Inc.

Sempra Energy

Tennessee Valley Authority

The Southern Company

The Williams Companies, Inc.

TXU Corp.

WPS Resources Corporation

Xcel Energy Inc.


In determining executive compensation for 2007, the following group of energy services firms with reported net income averaging about $1 billion/year and market capitalization averaging about $16
  billion was used. PSEG’s net income and market capitalization are approximately at the median of this group and we believe that this group is more closely aligned with PSEG.

AES Corporation

American Electric Power Company, Inc.

Consolidated Edison, Inc.

Dominion Resources, Inc.

Duke Energy Corporation

Edison International

Entergy Corporation

Exelon Corporation

FirstEnergy Corp.

FPL Group, Inc.

PG&E Corporation

Progress Energy, Inc.

Sempra Energy

The Southern Company

The Williams Companies, Inc.

TXU Corp.

Xcel Energy Inc.

As an initial positioning, the Committee targets the 50th percentile of relative positions within this group for total cash compensation, which is considered the total of salary and annual cash incentive
  compensation. The “mix” of total cash compensation for each of the executive positions is surveyed from this peer group. The reported pay structure from the competitive analysis is used as a general
  guideline in determining the appropriate mix of compensation among base salary, annual incentive opportunity and long-term compensation opportunity. There

is no predetermined formula regarding the
  allocation of salary and incentives. The mix of incentives is selected so as to be reflective of the competitive practice found in this group for each of the pay components listed above.

Compensation Components

Base Salary

The NEOs’ base salary levels are reviewed annually by the Committee using a budget it establishes for merit increases and salary survey data provided by external compensation consultants. Market
  competitive base salary levels are determined and established for all covered executive positions as well as for other officers. Annually, the individual performance of the executives with respect to corporate
  performance criteria is determined and taken into account when setting salaries against the competitive market data. Such corporate performance criteria include attainment of business unit plans and
  financial targets, as well as individual measures for each NEO related to such person’s area of responsibility. In addition, factors such as leadership ability, managerial skills and other personal aptitudes and
  attributes are considered. Base salaries for satisfactory performance are targeted at the median (50

th

percentile) of the competitive market. Generally, for 2006, base salaries as a group were increased 3.6%
  from 2005 levels to reflect general market adjustments for comparable positions.

The Committee attempts to assure that annual salary determinations, on average, fall within the range of median base salaries provided to executives in the peer panel that have duties and
  responsibilities similar to those of our executive officers.

Differences are primarily driven by the executive’s individual

performance and experience.

Base salaries and base salary adjustments for individual NEOs other than the CEO are determined relative to the recommendations of the CEO, considering the individual’s level of responsibilities,
  sustained performance over time and results during the immediately preceding year and the executive’s pay in relation to the market median. Performance metrics included achievement of business plans,
  safety and operational results, customer satisfaction, regulatory outcomes and other factors.

For fiscal year 2006, the base salary of E. James Ferland, Chairman of the Board and CEO, based on overall performance and consideration of market data, was set at a rate of $1,120,000 or a 3.7%
  increase over the rate for 2005, which was approximately the median of base salary provided to CEO’s of other large energy services organizations. In determining base salary for the CEO, individual
  performance in relation to corporate performance factors such as achievement of business plans, financial results, safety, human resources management, nuclear operations and civic leadership was
  considered. For 2007, until Mr. Ferland’s retirement on March 31st, he will be paid a salary at the annual rate of $1,160,000. On his election as President and COO of PSEG in October 2006, Ralph Izzo’s
  annual base salary rate was set at $700,000. For 2007, Mr. Izzo’s annual rate of base salary as COO of PSEG was increased to $725,000. The annual rate of


base salary for 2007 for Mr. Selover is $505,000 and for Mr. LaRossa is $380,000. Mr. Busch and Ms. Rado both retired in January 2007.

Annual Cash Incentive Compensation

The MICP, which was approved by stockholders in 2004, is an annual cash incentive compensation program for executive and other officers. To support the performance based objectives of our
  compensation program, corporate and business unit goals and measures are established each year based on factors deemed necessary to achieve strategic financial and non-financial business objectives. The
  goals and measures are established by the CEO for the NEO’s reporting to him, and for all other officers by the individual to whom he or she reports. The goals and measures applicable to each NEO for
  2006 are further discussed below.

The MICP was designed to comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which, as explained below, limits the Federal income tax deduction for compensation in excess of certain limits.
  The MICP sets a maximum award fund in any year of 2.5% of PSEG’s net income. The CEO’s maximum award cannot exceed 10% of the award fund and the maximum award for each other participant
  cannot exceed 90% of the award fund divided by the number of participants, other than the CEO, for that year. For 2006 performance under the MICP, these limits were $18,475,000 for the total award
  pool (of which $7,919,300 was awarded), $1,847,500 for the CEO’s maximum award and $437,600 for each other participant’s maximum award.

Subject to the overall maximums stated above, NEOs are eligible for annual incentive compensation based on a combination of the achievement of individual performance goals by each officer which
  determines his/her Individual Performance Factor, as adjusted by overall corporate performance, as measured by the Corporate Factor. The Corporate Factor is a financial measure, PSEG’s Return on
  Equity (ROE), which is a relative performance assessment comparing PSEG’s ROE against the median ROE performance of energy companies that comprise the Dow Jones Utility Index (DJUI). This
  Corporate Factor is the significant determinant of MICP awards. A maximum award is based on a comparative performance factor of 1.5 and is achieved if PSEG’s annual ROE, as measured on September
  30, exceeds the median ROE performance of the group of energy companies that make up the DJUI by five hundred basis points. The minimum award threshhold, based on a comparative performance
  factor of 0.5, is reached if PSEG’s ROE is not more than five hundred basis points below the DJUI median. Actual incentive awards for participants in the MICP are computed as follows: (A) the
  participant’s Target Award Amount (% of base salary) is multiplied by (B) the participant’s Individual Performance Factor (0.0 to 1.5), which, in turn, is multiplied by (C) the Corporate Factor to arrive at
  the Final Award. In no case, however, may a Final Award exceed the lesser of (i) 1.5 times the participant’s Target Award Amount or (ii) the maximum amount allowed for that participant under the total
  award pool for that year.

Individual Performance Goals for NEOs include the following measures: OSHA safety performance, operational performance, customer satisfaction, operations and environmental performance and
  compliance. Each NEO position has a targeted incentive award established by the Committee at the beginning of each year ranging from 35% (increased to 40% for 2007) to 100% of base salary. Annual
  incentive awards are intended to provide a competitive level of compensation if the corporation meets its financial goals and the NEO achieves his or her business unit specific and individual goals. Since
  MICP targets are set as a percentage of base salary, increases in salary affect target bonuses. The goals and measures applicable to each NEO for 2006 are further discussed on page 213.

For the 2006 performance year, based on PSEG’s ROE of 15.3%, as compared with the median ROE of the companies comprising the DJUI of 13.4%, the Corporate Factor applied to MICP
  participants was 1.19. Also for 2006, Mr. Ferland’s final award was limited to an overall performance factor of 1.5, the maximum allowed, which was also the average overall performance factor of his direct
  reports. The MICP awards of the NEOs for 2006 are shown below in the Summary Compensation Table. The Committee made its determinations regarding MICP awards for the 2006 performance year in
  January of 2007. Payment was made as soon as practicable thereafter.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation

The LTIP was approved by PSEG’s stockholders at the 2004 Annual Meeting. To permit flexibility, the LTIP provides for different forms of equity awards including:

•

stock options (the right to purchase shares of Common Stock at a stated price);

•

restricted stock (shares of Common Stock subject to forfeiture if certain service requirements or other restrictions are not met); during the restriction period, recipients of shares of restricted


stock may exercise full voting rights with respect to those shares and are entitled to receive all dividends on the shares; and

•

performance units (the right to receive a stated number of shares of Common Stock or cash based upon the value of such stated number of shares upon the attainment of certain performance
      goals).

NEOs, other officers and other key employees, as selected by the Committee, are eligible to participate in the LTIP.

This plan is designed to attract and retain qualified personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, to motivate participants toward goal achievement by means of appropriate incentives, to achieve
  long-range corporate goals, to provide incentive compensation opportunities that are competitive with those of other similar companies and to align participants’ interests with those of our stockholders.

The exercise price of any stock option granted under the LTIP may not be below the closing price of Common Stock on the date of grant, no repricing may be done without stockholder approval and
  no discounted options may be granted. Performance goals are used for any performance based awards.

Neither options nor performance units were granted to NEOs in 2005 and 2006. All grants made were restricted stock awards because the Committee determined that this type of award was most
  compatible with the proposed merger with Exelon. In January 2005, LTIP awards were made with respect to 2005 compensation and in December 2005, LTIP awards were made with respect to 2006
  compensation.

For 2007 grants, the Committee determined that senior officers, including the NEOs, would be granted a long-term award consisting of 50% performance shares and 50% non-qualified stock options.
  For other participants, 2007 awards would consist of 50% performance shares and 50% restricted stock. The Committee structured the grants in this manner to increase the performance related nature of
  the grants to senior officers.

Grant levels are determined by the Committee based upon several factors including the value of long-term incentive awards made by firms in the peer group to executives in similar positions and whose
  cash compensation is similar to each NEO as well as the individual’s ability to contribute to PSEG’s overall success. The level of grants is reviewed annually by the Committee. In general, when making
  LTIP grants, the Committee’s determinations are made independently from any consideration of the individual’s prior LTIP awards.

The CEO determines his recommendations for the size of LTIP grants for NEOs and each other participant by averaging the median of long-term incentive grants for a comparable position in the peer
  group and the median of long-term incentive grants for comparable levels of base salary for positions within the peer group. In making his recommendation for the size of a particular LTIP grant for each
  NEO, the CEO adjusts this average to reflect the individual’s performance and ability to contribute to PSEG’s long-term value.

PSEG has  not granted stock options to NEOs since early 2004, shortly after PSEG’s stockholders approved the LTIP at the 2004 Annual Meeting. Generally, the Committee considers changes regarding
  executive officer salary adjustments, short-term cash incentive goals and equity compensation grants at its December meeting each year. However, because of the ongoing review of executive compensation
  by Cook at year-end 2006, LTIP awards for 2007 were not made until January 2007. For future years, the Committee intends to resume its practice of making compensation decisions and LTIP grants within
  the same period, generally around December of each year. The Committee expects this practice to be followed without consideration of the timing of release of earnings or other non-public information.

The following table discloses LTIP awards made by the Committee to the NEOs in February 2007:

The Stock Options granted have a term of ten years and an exercise price of $65.85 (the closing price on the date of grant). The right to exercise one-quarter of the stock options vests on each of
  December 31, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010.


The performance units are subject to the achievement of certain performance goals related to PSEG’s performance with respect to Total Shareholder Return and ROE relative to the companies in the
  DJUI over a performance period ending on December 31, 2009.

Other Executive Compensation Programs

Retirement

We provide certain retirement benefits to maintain practices that are competitive with companies with which we compete for executive talent. In addition to the qualified pension plan, we maintain
  supplemental plans to provide competitive retirement benefits. These benefits are described below under Pension Benefits.

Severance and Change in Control Benefits

We provide for severance benefits in the event of certain employment terminations. These benefits are available to officers, including the NEOs, in order to be competitive with the companies with
  which we compete for executive talent. We also provide severance benefits upon a change in control to officers, including the NEOs, and to certain key executive level employees. A change in control is by
  its nature disruptive to an organization and to many executives. Such executives are frequently key players in the success of organizational change. To assure the continuing performance of such executives
  in the face of a possible termination of employment in the event of a change in control, PSE&G deems it prudent to provide a competitive severance package. In addition, some executives, not a key party to
  such transaction, may have their employment terminated following its completion. A severance plan with benefits applicable upon a change in control is an important element for attracting and retaining
  key executives. These benefits are described below under Potential Payments upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control.

Perquisites

We also provide certain perquisites that PSEG believes are reasonable to maintain compensation practices that are competitive with companies with which we compete for executive talent. These
  include automobile use, financial planning services, annual physical examinations, spousal travel to accompany executive officers on business trips, PSEG-purchased tickets to entertainment and sporting
  events, home security, home computer services and chartered air travel. These perquisites are described in the Summary Compensation Table.

Stock Ownership Guidelines

To encourage equity ownership of Common Stock by our officers, PSEG has established guidelines for stock ownership over a reasonable period of time as follows:

•

CEO: 5x salary;

•

President/Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President: 3x salary;

•

Senior Vice President: 2x salary; and

•

Vice President: 1x salary.

In fulfilling the stock ownership guidelines, the executive may count all stock owned directly and beneficially. All restricted stock whether or not vested may be included. Also included are shares held
  in the Thrift Plan. Stock options and performance units are not counted.

PSEG’s Insider Trading Policy prohibits the pledging or hedging of such shares.

The Stock Ownership Guidelines will be reviewed annually by the Committee.

In making 2007 grants under the LTIP, the stock ownership policy was not a factor considered by the Committee.


The following table shows, for each NEO, the dollar amount of stock ownership required by the Stock Ownership Guidelines and the dollar amount of these actual stock holdings as of February 16, 2007

Accounting and Tax Implications

The Committee has considered the effect of the adoption of FAS 123R (see Notes 2 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K) regarding the expensing of
  stock options in determining the nature of the grants under the LTIP.

The Committee considers the tax-deductibility of our compensation payments. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) generally denies a deduction for United States federal income tax
  purposes for compensation in excess of $1 million for persons named in the proxy statement, except for compensation pursuant to shareholder-approved performance-based plans. Stockholder approval of
  the LTIP and MICP was received at PSEG’s 2004 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. As a result, performance-based compensation under these plans is not now subject to the limitation on deductions
  contained in Section 162(m) of the IRC.

In 2006, Messrs. Ferland and Izzo had compensation (consisting of base salary and the taxable value of restricted stock that vested during the year) in excess of the amount deductible under Section
  162(m) of the IRC. The Committee will continue to evaluate executive compensation in light of Section 162(m) of the IRC. For 2007, the Committee has determined to make all awards to NEO’s under the
  LTIP performance-based.

In light of Section 162(m), as well as certain New York Stock Exchange rules, the Committee’s general policy is to present all incentive compensation plans in which executive
  officers participate to stockholders for approval prior to implementation.

The amount shown reflects the expense included on PSE&G Financial Statements for 2006 related to restricted stock awards and performance units granted in current or prior years under the LTIP and still
      outstanding as determined under Financial Accounting Standard (FAS)123R. The fair value at the grant date of the number of shares of equity awards granted in 2006 is shown below in the Grants of
      Plan-Based Awards Table. Generally, restricted stock awards vest one-third annually and, during the restricted period, earn dividends as declared on the Common Stock.

Under their terms, all shares of restricted stock vest upon retirement. For Mr. Busch and Ms. Rado, in accordance with FAS 123R, a portion of the market value of unvested shares of restricted stock was
      recognized in 2006 and reflected in the amount shown. The amount expensed by PSE&G was accelerated to reflect earlier vesting following their announcements of anticipated retirement dates.

Performance units are denominated in shares of Common Stock and are subject to achievement of certain performance goals over a three-year period and are payable as determined by PSEG in shares of
      stock or cash. For a discussion of the assumptions made in valuation see Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in PSEG’s 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

      compensation and benefit expense was used; for gasoline and maintenance, estimates were used based on the vehicle’s annual mileage. For each NEO, the amount that exceeded the greater of $25,000 or

Material Factors Concerning Awards Shown in Summary Compensation Table, Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table and Employment Agreements

MICP

The Plan-based awards for annual incentive compensation included in the Summary Compensation Table were paid in 2007 with respect to 2006 performance under the terms of the MICP. The range of
  possible awards for each NEO in relation to his Target Award is set forth in the Grants Based Awards Table above. The results of individual performance goals are multiplied by the overall corporate
  performance factor and applied against the individual’s performance target (see Compensation Discussion and Analysis for an explanation of how the MICP works).

Mr. Ferland’s 2006 MICP award was $1,680,000. The Organization and Compensation Committee evaluates Mr. Ferland’s performance based on overall corporate performance plus the relative
  performance of his direct reports taken as a group.

Mr. Izzo’s 2006 MICP award was $437,600 and was limited by the maximum award allowed for participants in the MICP other than the CEO (see Compensation Discussion and Analysis for an
  explanation). Mr. Izzo had eight performance goals for 2006, with the preponderance related to business integration planning for the proposed merger with Exelon and contingency planning in the event of a
  merger termination. His other goals included responsibility for developing a corporate-wide financial plan for 2007-2011, providing programs to improve employee health and safety and increasing diversity
  in employee recruitment and retention.

Mr. Selover’s 2006 MICP award was $356,250. Mr. Selover had five performance goals for 2006, with the preponderance related to legal support of the merger preparation and integration planning
  processes. His other goals related to support for maintaining the business of PSEG on a stand alone basis in event of a merger termination; restart of operations on merger termination and improving quality
  of the legal and environmental services to the operating companies.

Mr. Busch’s 2006 MICP award was $303,750. Mr. Busch had two performance goals for 2006, both related to the performance of Services. The first related to maintaining the day-to-day operations,
  including staffing levels, of Services during the merger integration process to enable it to support the operating companies effectively. The second was to demonstrate, through client surveys, improvements
  in accuracy, responsiveness, innovation and value of the services provided to the operating companies.

Ms. Rado’s 2006 MICP award was $149,600. Ms. Rado had two performance goals for 2006. The first related to maintaining the design and integrity of PSEG’s financial systems and processes
  during the


merger integration process. The second related to alignment of PSEG’s purchase accounting and accounting policy systems in anticipation of the merger close.

Mr. LaRossa’s 2006 MICP award was $176,400. Mr. LaRossa had four performance goals for 2006, each related to the operations of PSE&G. One related to customer satisfaction as measured by
  customer survey responses; another related to workforce safety as measured by OSHA incident results; a third related to reliability of electric service measured by scores on availability indices and the last
  related to managing capital and O&M expenditures with target levels of $362.7 million for capital expenditures and $295.2 million for O&M expenditures.

LTIP

As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, no LTIP awards were made to NEOs in 2006, except for an award of 3,125 shares of restricted stock to Mr. Izzo upon his election as
  President and COO of PSEG in October 2006. The award was determined based on the proportionate difference between the restricted stock award he received in December 2005 as President and COO of
  PSE&G and the award he would have received had he been President and COO of PSEG at that time.

While no Performance Unit Awards were made during 2006, the performance measurement period with respect to Performance Unit Awards granted by the Committee in 2004 was completed on
  December 31, 2006. Under the terms of the award grants, award recipients were eligible to receive 100% of their grant amount if, for the three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2006,
  (a) PSEG’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) placed it within the third quintile of the companies within the DJUI and (b) PSEG’s ROE was within one percent (1%) of the ROE of the DJUI

.

For
  performance above or below these levels,

the final award could be increased to as much as 200% of the grant amount (TSR in the first quintile and ROE more than 3% above the DJUI) decreased to as little as zero.

See the Option Exercises and Stock Vested During 2006 Table, below, for a list of the NEOs’ target awards. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the comparative data necessary to calculate
  comparative performance and final award amounts was not yet available.

Employment Agreements

PSEG entered into an employment agreement dated as of June 16, 1998 and amended as of November 20, 2001 with Mr. Ferland (together, the Ferland Employment Agreement) covering his
  employment as Chief Executive Officer through March 31, 2007. The Ferland Employment Agreement provides that Mr. Ferland will be renominated for election as a director during his employment
  thereunder. The Ferland Employment Agreement also provides that Mr. Ferland’s base salary, target annual incentive bonus and long-term incentive bonus will be determined based on compensation
  practices for CEOs of similar companies and that his annual salary will not be reduced during its term. The Ferland Employment Agreement also provided for an award to him of 150,000 shares of restricted
  Common Stock as of June 16, 1998 and 60,000 shares of restricted Common Stock as of November 20, 2001, with 60,000 shares vesting in 2002; 20,000 shares vesting in 2003; 30,000 shares vesting in 2004;
  40,000 shares vesting in 2005; 30,000 shares vesting in 2006; and 30,000 shares vesting in 2007. The Ferland Employment Agreement provides for the granting of 22 years of pension credit for Mr. Ferland’s
  prior experience, which was awarded at the time of his initial employment.

When Mr. Ferland retires at the end of his term of employment on March 31, 2007, he will be fully vested in any outstanding shares of restricted stock and any other equity awards he received as a
  long-term incentive award, and he will be paid any previously deferred compensation. He will not receive any special severance payments on retirement.

PSEG entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Izzo dated October 18, 2003, covering his employment as President and COO of PSE&G and in other executive positions to which he may be
  elected through October 18, 2008. The agreement provides that his base salary, target annual incentive bonus and long-term incentive bonus will be determined based on compensation practices of similar
  companies and that annual salary will not be reduced during its term, and awarded him options with respect to 250,000 shares of Common Stock, 50,000 of which vest on each October 18 from 2004 through
  2008, and expire on October 18, 2013, provided he has remained continuously employed through each such vesting date.

All NEOs participate in either a traditional defined benefit pension plan (pension plan) or a cash balance pension plan (cash balance plan) (depending on date of hire), each of which is a qualified plan
      under the IRC. Such plans are available to all other employees under the same terms and conditions. Messrs. Ferland, Izzo, Selover and Ms. Rado participate in the pension plan. Mr. Busch participates in
      the cash balance plan.


Certain employees receive additional years of credited service for the purpose of retirement benefit calculations in recognition of prior work experience before joining employment, including 22 years for
      Mr. Ferland and 15 years for Mr. Busch.


Amounts shown represent actuarial present value of accumulated benefit computed as of the same pension plan measurement date used for PSEG’s financial statements for the year ended December 31,
      2006, with two exceptions: (i) NEOs were assumed to retire at the earliest point at which the benefits were payable on an unreduced basis in the plan providing the largest target benefit and (ii) no pre-
      retirement termination, disability or death was assumed to occur. For a discussion of the valuation method and material assumptions applied in quantifying the present value, see Note 16 to Notes to
      Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.


The actuarial present value of accumulated benefits based on actual years of service is $2,112,000 and the actuarial present value of accumulated benefits based on additional years of service is $1,264,000.


Qualified Pension Plans

All employees are eligible to participate in either a traditional defined benefit pension plan (pension plan) or a cash balance pension plan (cash balance plan). The pension plan covers employees hired
  prior to January 1, 1996 and provides participants with a life annuity benefit at normal retirement (age 65) pursuant to a formula based upon (a) the participant’s number of years of service and (b) the
  average of the participant’s five highest years of compensation after 12/31/94 up to the limit imposed by the IRC.

The benefit formula is A

+

B

+

C:

A

=

1.3% of the lesser of 5-year final average earnings not in excess of $24,600 times years of credited service not exceeding 35 years,

B

=

1.5% of the amount by which 5-year final average earnings exceeds $24,600 times years of credited service not exceeding 35 years,

C

=

1.5% of 5-year final average earnings times years of credited service in excess of 35 years.

An additional benefit equal to $4.00 per month for each year of credited service is payable until the retiree reaches age 65.

Participants become fully vested in their pension plan benefit upon completion of five years of service. Benefits are payable on an unreduced basis (i) at age 65, (ii) at age 60, if the participant’s age, plus
  years of service, equals or exceeds 80 or (iii) at age 55, if the participant has 25 or more years of service. Participants whose age, plus years of service, equals or exceeds 80, but who are not yet age 55, may
  commence their pension plan benefits on a reduced basis. Messrs. Ferland, and Selover are currently eligible for early retirement under the pension plan. Mr. Ferland will retire on March 31, 2007.
  Mr. Busch and Ms. Rado retired in January 2007.

The cash balance plan covers employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 1996 and provides each participant with a life annuity benefit at normal retirement (age 65) equal to the actuarial equivalent
  of a notational amount maintained for him/her. Participants are eligible for retirement under the cash balance plan upon the attainment of age 55 with five or more years of service. Participants’ accounts
  are credited each year with a percentage of compensation, which is determined based on the participant’s age plus years of service measured at year-end.

Each participant’s notional amount grows each year with interest credits based on a 6.0% annual rate of interest. Participants become fully vested in their cash balance plan benefit upon completion of five
  years of service.

Reinstatement Plan

All employees are eligible to participate in a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan, the Retirement Income Reinstatement Plan for Non-Represented Employees (Reinstatement Plan), designed
  to replace earned pension benefits as determined by the qualified pension formula, but which are not eligible for payment from the qualified pension plans as a result of IRC mandated limits for qualified
  plans. The benefits payable under this plan mirror those of the qualified plans described above except that the compensation considered in computing the benefit (i) will not be limited by qualified plan
  limits, (ii) will include any amounts that the participant may have deferred under deferred compensation plans, (iii) will include amounts earned under MICP (which are not considered under the qualified
  pension plans), (iv) will be limited to 150% of average base salary for the applicable five years and (v) will be offset by any benefits received by the participant under the qualified plan.


Mid-Career Plan

Certain employees receive additional years of service for the purpose of retirement benefit calculations in recognition of prior work experience. Such benefits are paid from a non-qualified plan, the
  Mid-Career Hire Supplemental Retirement Income Plan (Mid-Career Plan). Under the Mid-Career Plan, certain participants, including the NEOs, receive an additional five years of credited service for the
  purpose of pension benefit calculations if they retire between ages 60 and 65. The credited years of service reduce by one year for each six-month period such participant works beyond age 65. This feature
  of the plan is designed to encourage retirement on or before age 65. Benefits payable under the Mid-Career Plan mirror those payable under the Reinstatement Plan, except that the additional years of
  service are considered in calculating the amount of benefit. Any benefit payable under this plan is offset by benefits payable under the qualified plan and the Reinstatement Plan.

Limited Plan

Certain employees, including the NEOs, participate in a limited non-qualified supplemental retirement plan, the Limited Supplemental Benefits Plan for Certain Employees (Limited Plan). This plan
  seeks to provide a total target replacement income percentage equal to credited service for qualified pension calculation purposes, Mid-Career Plan calculation purposes plus 30 to a maximum of 75%.
  Compensation covered for the Limited Plan is the same as for the Mid-Career Plan. The target replacement amount under the Limited Plan is reduced by any pension benefits accrued and vested from a
  previous employer at the time of hire, by the participant’s Social Security benefit at normal retirement age and by the pension benefits provided by each other PSEG retirement benefit plan (qualified plans
  and non-qualified plans). The Limited Plan also provides a death benefit equal to 150% of base compensation if death occurs while the participant is actively employed. Participants become entitled to a
  Limited Plan benefit only upon (a) retirement under the terms of the qualified plan in which they participate (pension plan or cash balance plan) or (b) death, at which point the benefit is payable as an
  annuity on an unreduced basis.

Deferred Compensation Plan

Under the PSEG’s Deferred Compensation Plan for Certain Employees (Deferred Compensation Plan), participants, including the NEOs, may elect to defer any portion of their compensation by
  making appropriate elections in the calendar year prior to the year in which the services giving rise to the compensation being deferred is rendered. For performance-based compensation, elections may be
  made up to the date that is six months before the end of the related performance period, as long as a) the performance period is at least 12 months in length, b) the participant performed services
  continuously from the date the performance criteria were established through the date the deferral election is made and c) at the time the deferral election is made, the performance-based compensation is
  not both i) substantially certain to be paid and ii) readily ascertainable. A participant may change an election to defer compensation not later than the date that is the last date that an election to defer may
  be made.

At the same time he/she elects to defer compensation, the participant must make an election as to the timing and the form of distribution from his/her Deferred Compensation Plan account.
  Distributions may commence (a) on the thirtieth day after the date he/she terminates employment or, in the alternative, (b) on January 15th of any calendar year following termination of employment
  elected by him/her, but in any event no later than the later of (i) the January of the year following the year of his/her 70th birthday or (ii) the January following termination of employment. Notwithstanding
  the forgoing, however, for NEOs, distribution of his/her account may not occur earlier than six months following the date of his/her


termination of service. Participants may elect to receive the distribution of their Deferred Compensation account in the form of (x) one lump-sum payment, (y) annual distributions over a five-year period or
  (z) annual distributions over a 10-year period.

Participants may make changes of distribution elections on a prospective basis. Participants may also make changes of distribution elections with respect to prior deferred compensation as long as (a) any
  such new distribution election is made at least one year prior to the date that the commencement of the distribution would otherwise have occurred and (b) the revised commencement date is at least five
  years later than the date that the commencement of the distribution would otherwise have occurred.

Amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan are credited with earnings based on (a) the performance of one or more of the life style investment funds or the S&P 500 Fund available to
  employees under PSEG’s 401K Plans or (b) at the rate of Prime plus


/


%, in such percentages as selected by the participant. A participant who fails to provide a designation of investment funds will
  accrue earnings on his/her account at the rate of Prime plus

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

OR CHANGE-IN-CONTROL

The employment agreements of Messrs. Ferland and Izzo discussed above each provide for certain severance benefits. Each of these agreements provides that if the individual is terminated without
  “cause” (a willful failure to perform his duties) or resigns for “good reason” (a reduction in pay, position or authority) during the term of such agreement, the respective entire restricted stock award and/or
  entire option award becomes vested, the individual will be paid a benefit of two times base salary and target bonus, and his welfare benefits will be continued for two years unless he is sooner employed. In
  the event such a termination occurs after a “change in control” (as defined below), the payment to the individual becomes three times the sum of salary and target bonus, continuation of welfare benefits for
  three years unless sooner reemployed, payment of the net present value of providing three years additional service under our retirement plans and a gross-up for excise taxes due under the IRC on any
  termination payments. Each of the agreements provides that the individual is prohibited for one year (two years for Mr. Ferland) from competing with and for two years from recruiting employees from us
  or its subsidiaries or affiliates, after termination of employment. Violations of these provisions require a forfeiture of the respective restricted stock and option grants and certain benefits.

PSEG’s Key Executive Severance Plan provides severance benefits to Messrs. Selover and LaRossa and, prior to their retirements, Mr. Busch and Ms. Rado and to certain of our key executive-level
  employees whose employment is terminated without cause after a Change in Control.

Under the Key Executive Severance Plan, if Mr. Selover and Mr. LaRossa are terminated without cause or resign their employment for good reason within two years after a change in control, they will receive (1) a pro rata
  bonus based on their respective target annual incentive compensation, (2) three times the sum of their salary and target incentive bonus, (3) accelerated vesting of equity-based awards, (4) a lump sum payment
  equal to the actuarial equivalent of their benefits under all of our retirement plans in which they participate calculated as though the participant remained employed for three years beyond the date their
  employment terminates less the actuarial equivalent of such benefits on the date their employment terminates, (5) three years continued welfare benefits (the first 18 months of which will be provided through
  PSEG-paid COBRA continuation coverage), (6) one year of PSEG-paid outplacement services and (7) vesting of any compensation previously deferred. Similar provisions applied to Mr. Busch and Ms.
  Rado prior to their respective retirements.

Messrs. Selover and LaRossa also participate in PSEG’s Separation Allowance Benefit Plan for Non-Represented Employees (Separation Allowance Plan) which provides certain severance benefits to
  non-represented employees who suffer a termination of employment as a result of a reduction in force or reorganization. Under the Separation Allowance Plan, key managers, including Messrs. Selover and
  LaRossa, are entitled to two weeks of base salary for each year of service, with a minimum of 26 weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks of base salary, as well as a prorated payment of their target incentive
  award and certain outplacement services, educational assistance, health care and life insurance coverage. Similar provisions applied to Mr. Busch and Ms. Rado until their respective retirements.

If a termination without cause, with good reason or for a reduction in force or reorganization had occurred on December 31, 2006, each of the NEOs would have received the following benefits:

Ferland:

$

13,800,729

Izzo:

$

7,880,567

Selover:

$

1,949,381

Busch:

$

1,464,153

Rado:

$

700,259

La Rossa:

$

941,404


If a termination without cause or with good reason had occurred on December 31, 2006 following a change in control, each of the NEOs would have received the following benefits:

Ferland:

$

16,069,885

Izzo:

$

12,872,701

Selover:

$

3,702,722

Busch:

$

3,158,885

Rado:

$

1,365,323

La Rossa:

$

3,812,893

When Mr. Busch and Ms. Rado retired in January 2007, neither received a severance benefit under these plans.

Change in Control under the Employment Agreements of Messrs. Ferland and Izzo and under the Key Executive Severance Plan generally means the occurrence of any of the following events:

(a) any person is or becomes the beneficial owner of our securities representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of PSEG’s then outstanding securities; or

(b) a majority of PSEG’s Board of Directors is replaced without approval of the current Board; or

(c) there is consummated a merger or consolidation of PSEG, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in PSEG’s voting securities outstanding immediately prior to such merger
  continuing to represent at least 75% of the combined voting power of the securities of PSEG or such surviving entity immediately after such merger or consolidation; or

(d) PSEG’s shareholders approve a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of us or there is consummated an agreement for the sale or disposition by us of all or substantially all of PSEG’s
  assets.

PSE&G is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PSEG. PSE&G’s directors consist of five persons who are also directors of PSEG: Ms. Dorsa, and Messrs. Ferland, Gamper, Harper and Izzo. Messrs. Ferland and
      Izzo are employees and are not paid any fees as directors. Ms. Dorsa and Messrs. Gamper and Harper are paid a retainer and meeting fees as PSEG directors and do not receive an additional retainer as
      directors of PSE&G. The amounts shown below include the fees paid to each as PSEG directors.


Includes all meeting fees, chair/committee retainer fees and cash portion ($25,000) of the annual retainer. During 2006, each director who was not an officer of us or our subsidiaries and affiliates was paid
      an annual retainer of $50,000 and a fee of $1,500 for attendance at any Board or committee meeting, inspection trip, conference or other similar activity relating to us or PSE&G. Pursuant to the
      Compensation Plan for Outside Directors, a certain percentage, as determined by the Board, fifty percent during 2006, of the annual retainer is paid in shares of Common Stock. Each Committee Chair
      received an additional annual retainer of $5,000, except for the Chair of the Audit Committee, who received $10,000. In addition, each member of the Audit Committee received an additional annual
      retainer of $5,000.


Includes a payment of the number of shares of Common Stock equal to $25,000, the fair value computed in accordance with FAS 123R, the stock portion of the annual retainer. Also includes the grant
      date fair value computed in accordance with FAS 123R of 1,000 shares granted under the Stock Plan for Outside Directors, pursuant to which directors who are not employees of us or our subsidiaries
      receive shares of restricted stock for each year of service as a director. For 2006, this amount was 1,000 shares.

The restrictions on the shares of Common Stock granted under the Stock Plan for Outside Directors provide that the shares are subject to forfeiture if the director leaves service at any time prior to the
      Annual Meeting of Stockholders following his or her 72nd birthday. This restriction would be deemed to


have been satisfied if the director’s service were terminated after a change in control as defined in the Plan or if the director were to die in office. The Plan’s administrative committee (comprised of the
      directors who do not participate in the plan) has the ability to waive these restrictions for good cause shown. Restricted stock may not be sold or otherwise transferred prior to the lapse of the restrictions.
      Dividends on shares of Common Stock held subject to restrictions are paid directly to the director and the director has the right to vote the shares of Common Stock.

In November 2006, the Committee recommended changes to the Directors Restricted Stock Plan, to provide that grants would be made on May 1 of each year, rather than on the first business day
      following the Annual Meeting, and to reflect the change from age 70 to age 72 in the mandatory retirement age for Directors previously made by the Board. The Board subsequently approved these
      changes. Subsequently, the Board, based on the recommendation of the Organization and Compensation Committee, determined to replace the Directors’ Stock Plan with a new equity compensation plan
      for outside directors.


Includes interest earned under the Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan at Prime plus


/


% to the extent that it exceeds 120% of the applicable Federal long-term rate. The directors do not participate
      in a PSEG-sponsored pension plan.

Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan

Under PSEG’s Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan), directors who are not employees may elect to defer any portion of their retainer and meeting
  attendance fees by making appropriate elections in the calendar year prior to the year in which the services giving rise to the compensation being deferred is rendered. A participant may change an election
  to defer compensation not later than the date that is the last date that an election to defer may be made.

At the same time he/she elects to defer compensation, the participant must make an election as to the timing and the form of distribution from his/her Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan account.
  Distributions may commence (i) on the thirtieth day after the date he/she terminates service as a director or, in the alternative, (ii) on January 15th of any calendar year following termination of service
  elected by the him/her, but in any event no later than the later of (A) the January of the year following the year of the his/her 71st birthday or (B) the January following termination of service. Participants
  may elect to receive the distribution of their Directors’ Deferred Compensation account in the form of (i) one lump-sum payment, (ii) annual distributions over a period selected by the participant, up to 10
  years.

Participants may make changes of distribution elections on a prospective basis. Participants may also make changes of distribution elections with respect to prior deferred compensation as long (A) any
  such new distribution election is made at least one year prior to the date that the commencement of the distribution would otherwise have occurred and (B) the revised commencement date is at least five
  years later than the date that the commencement of the distribution would otherwise have occurred.

Amounts deferred under the Directors’ Deferred Compensation Plan are credited with earnings based on (i) the performance of one or more of the lifestyle investment funds or the S&P 500 fund
  available to employees under PSEG’s 401K Plans, (ii) at the rate of Prime plus


/


% or (iii) by reference to the performance of the Common Stock, in such percentages designated by the participant. A
  participant who fails to provide a designation will accrue earnings on his/her account at the rate of Prime plus
