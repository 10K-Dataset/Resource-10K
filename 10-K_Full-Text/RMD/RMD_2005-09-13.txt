General

We are a leading developer, manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating, diagnosing, and managing sleep-disordered breathing and other
respiratory disorders. Sleep-disordered breathing or “SDB”, includes obstructive sleep apnea, or “OSA”, and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep. When we were formed in 1989, our primary purpose was to
commercialize a treatment for OSA developed by Professor Colin Sullivan. This treatment, nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, or “CPAP”, was the first successful noninvasive treatment for OSA. CPAP systems deliver pressurized air,
typically through a nasal mask, to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep.

Since the development of CPAP, we have developed a number of innovative products for SDB and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators, diagnostic products, mask systems, headgear and other accessories.
Our growth has been fuelled by geographic expansion, increased awareness of respiratory conditions as a significant health concern among physicians and patients, and our research and product development effort.

We employ 1,927 people and sell our products in over 60 countries through a
combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors.

Our web site address is www.resmed.com. We make our periodic reports, together with any amendments, available on our web site, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish the reports with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Corporate History

ResMed Inc, a Delaware corporation, was formed in March
1994 as the ultimate holding company for our Americas, Asia-Pacific, and European operating subsidiaries. On June 1, 1995, we completed an initial public offering of common stock and on June 2, 1995 our common stock commenced trading on
the NASDAQ National Market. On September 30, 1999 we transferred our principal public listing to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), or “NYSE”, trading under the ticker symbol RMD. On November 25, 1999, we established a secondary
listing of our common stock via Chess Depositary Instruments, or “CDI’s”, on the Australian Stock Exchange, or “ASX”, also under the symbol RMD. Ten CDI’s on the ASX represent one share of our common stock on the NYSE.
On July 1, 2002, we converted our ASX listing status from a foreign exempt listing to a full listing.

Our Australian subsidiary, ResMed Holdings Limited, was originally organized in 1989 by Dr. Peter Farrell to acquire from Baxter Center for Medical
Research Pty Limited, or “Baxter”, the rights to certain technology relating to CPAP treatment as well as Baxter’s existing CPAP device business. Baxter had sold CPAP devices in Australia since 1988, having acquired the rights to the
technology in 1987.

Since formation we have acquired a number of operating businesses including:

The Market

Sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two
distinct states: rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep and non-rapid eye movement, or non-REM, sleep. REM sleep, which is about 20-25% of total sleep experienced by adults, is characterized by a high level of brain activity, bursts of rapid eye
movement, increased heart and respiration rates, and paralysis of many muscles. Non-REM sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth; stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest.

The upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction
of upper airway muscles. Normally, during REM sleep and deeper levels of non-REM sleep, upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows. Individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway
during sleep, called apneas, and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas. These breathing irregularities result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration, causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased
carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond. Typically, the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep, causing the throat muscles to contract, opening the airway. After a few gasping breaths, blood oxygen levels increase and the individual
can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself. Sufferers of OSA typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour. While these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep, the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions.
In addition, OSA has recently been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant co-morbidity for heart disease, stroke and diabetes.

Scientists estimate that one in five adults have some form of obstructive sleep apnea. In the U.S. alone, this represents approximately 43 million
people. Despite the high prevalence of OSA, there is a general lack of awareness of OSA among both the medical community and the general public. It is estimated that less than 10% of those with OSA have been diagnosed or treated. Many health care
professionals are often unable to diagnose OSA because they are unaware that such non-specific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, hypertension and irritability are characteristic of OSA.

While OSA has been diagnosed in a broad cross-section of the population, it
is predominant among middle-aged men and those who are obese, smoke, consume alcohol in excess or use muscle-relaxing and pain-killing drugs. A strong association has been discovered between OSA and a number of cardiovascular diseases. Recent
studies have shown that SDB is present in approximately 80% of

- 4 -

patients with drug-resistant hypertension, approximately 60% of stroke patients and approximately 50% of patients with congestive heart failure. More
recently, studies have shown a connection between SDB and diabetes: recent reports indicate that SDB is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance.

Sleep-Disordered Breathing and Obstructive Sleep Apnea

Sleep-disordered breathing encompasses all physiological processes that cause detrimental breathing patterns during sleep.
Manifestations include OSA, central sleep apnea, or CSA, and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep. Hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity, chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease. OSA is the
most common form of SDB.

Sleep fragmentation and the loss of
the deeper levels of sleep caused by OSA can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness, reduced cognitive function, including memory loss and lack of concentration, depression and irritability. OSA sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and
an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas. Several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation, increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by OSA may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality due to angina, stroke and heart attack. Patients with OSA have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving, response speed and visual motor coordination, and studies have
linked OSA to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents.

Generally, an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of OSA is referred by a general practitioner to a specialist for further evaluation. The diagnosis of OSA typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep
clinic or the patient’s home. During overnight testing, respiratory parameters and sleep patterns maybe monitored, along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels. Simpler tests, using devices such as our Apnealink, or
our automatic positive airway pressure devices, monitor airflow during sleep, and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns. These tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas, hypopneas or subconscious
awakenings. We estimate that there are currently around 3,000 sleep clinics in the United States, a substantial portion of which are affiliated with hospitals. The number of sleep clinics has expanded significantly from approximately 100 such
facilities in 1985.

Existing Therapies

Before 1981, the primary treatment for OSA was a tracheotomy, a surgical
procedure to cut a hole in the patient’s windpipe to create a channel for airflow. Most recently, alternative treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, or UPPP, in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess
tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway, implanting a device to add support to the soft palate, or mandibular advancement, in which the lower jaw is moved forward to widen the patient’s airway. UPPP alone has a poor success rate;
however, when performed in conjunction with multi-stage upper airway surgical procedures, a greater success rate has been claimed. These combined procedures, performed by highly specialized surgeons, are expensive and involve prolonged and often
painful recovery periods.

CPAP, by contrast, is a non-invasive
means of treating OSA. CPAP was first used as a treatment for OSA in 1980 by Dr. Colin Sullivan, the past Chairman of our Medical Advisory Board. CPAP systems were commercialized for treatment of OSA in the United States in the mid 1980’s.
Today, use of CPAP is generally acknowledged as the most effective and least invasive therapy for managing OSA.

During CPAP treatment, a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable airflow generator that delivers room air at a positive
pressure. The patient breathes in air from the flow

- 5 -

generator and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface. Continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the
upper airway open and unobstructed. Interfaces include nasal masks, and nasal pillows. Sometimes, when a patient leaks air through their mouth, a full-face mask may need to be used, rather than a nasal interface.

CPAP is not a cure and therefore, must be used on a nightly basis as long as
treatment is required. Patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of CPAP treatment. Early generations of CPAP units provided limited patient comfort and convenience. Patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks
and had difficulty falling asleep with the CPAP device operating at the prescribed pressure. In more recent years, product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed. These include more comfortable patient interface
systems; delay timers which gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily; bilevel air flow generators, including VPAP systems, which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation; heated humidification
systems to make the airflow more comfortable; and auto titration devices which reduce the average pressure delivered during the night.

Business Strategy

We believe that the SDB market will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of OSA, improved
understanding of the role of SDB treatment in the management of cardiac, neurologic, metabolic and related disorders, and an increase in home-based diagnosis. Our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the
SDB market consists of the following key elements:

Continue
Product Development and Innovation.

We are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of SDB. We have been a leading innovator of products designed to more effectively treat SDB,
increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy. For example, in 1999 we introduced the Mirage Full Face Mask. This mask contains an inflatable air pocket, which conforms to the patient’s facial contours, creating a
more comfortable and better seal. In 2002 we introduced the AutoSet Spirit flow generator, our second-generation autotitrating device that adapts to the patient’s breathing patterns to more effectively treat OSA. In 2003, we introduced the
Mirage Activa nasal mask, with active cushion technology to automatically seal mask leaks. In 2004, we introduced the Mirage Swift nasal pillows system, a less obtrusive, lightweight, and flexible alternative to nasal masks. We believe that
continued product development and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success. Approximately 13% of our employees are devoted to research and development activities. In fiscal year 2005, we invested $30.0 million, or 7% of our revenues, in
research and development.

Expand Geographic
Presence.

We market our products in over 60 countries to sleep clinics, home health care dealers and third party payers. We intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal markets, as well as expand the
depth of our presence in other geographic regions.

Increase
Public and Clinical Awareness.

We intend to continue to expand our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of SDB and our treatment alternatives. These promotional activities target the population with
predisposition to SDB as well as primary care physicians and specialists, such as cardiologists, neurologists and pulmonologists. In addition, we also target special interest groups, including the National Stroke Association, the American Heart
Association and the National Sleep Foundation.

During fiscal
2005, 2004, and 2003, we donated $0.5 million, $0.5 million and $nil respectively to the ResMed Foundation in the United States, and the ResMed Foundation Limited in Australia, to further enhance research and awareness of SDB. The contributions to
the Foundations reflect ResMed’s commitment to medical research into sleep-disordered breathing, particularly the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.

- 6 -

Expand into New Clinical Applications.

We continually seek to identify new
applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs. Recent studies have established a clinical association between OSA and both stroke and congestive heart failure, and have recognized SDB as a cause of hypertension or high blood
pressure. Research also indicates that SDB is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. We have developed a device for the treatment of Cheyne-Stokes breathing in patients with congestive heart failure. In addition,
we maintain close working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology.

Leverage the Experience of our Management Team and Medical Advisory Board.

Our senior management team has extensive
experience in the medical device industry in general, and in the field of SDB in particular. Our Medical Advisory Board is comprised of experts in the field of SDB. We intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these individuals
to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused by SDB.

Products

Our portfolio of products for the treatment of OSA and other forms of SDB includes airflow generators, diagnostic products, mask systems, headgear and
other accessories.

Air Flow Generators

We produce CPAP, VPAP and AutoSet systems for the titration and treatment of
SDB. The flow generator systems deliver positive airway pressure through a patient interface, either a small nasal mask, nasal pillows system, or full-face mask.

Our VPAP units deliver ultra-quiet, comfortable bilevel therapy. There are two preset pressures: a higher pressure as the
patient breathes in, and a lower pressure as the patient breathes out. Breathing out against a lower pressure makes treatment more comfortable, particularly for patients who need high pressure levels or for those with impaired breathing ability.

AutoSet systems are based on a proprietary technology to
monitor breathing and can also be used in the diagnosis, treatment and management of OSA. CPAP and VPAP flow generators, accounted for approximately 49%, 50% and 53% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

- 7 -

With the recent acquisition of Saime, we have increased our presence in the European homecare ventilation
market. The VS and Elisée range of products are sophisticated, yet easy to use for physicians, clinicians and patients. We believe these devices complement our VPAP III and Autoset CS2 for patients who need ventilatory assistance.

Mask Systems and Diagnostic Products

Mask systems are one of the most important elements of SDB treatment
systems. Masks are a primary determinant of patient comfort and as such may drive or impede patient compliance with therapy. We have been a consistent innovator in masks, improving patient comfort while minimizing size and weight. Masks,
accessories, motors and diagnostic products accounted for approximately 51%, 50% and 47% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Accessories and Other Products

To enhance patient comfort, convenience and compliance, we market a variety of other products and accessories. These
products include humidifiers, such as the HumidAire, H2i, and H3i, which connect directly with the CPAP, VPAP and AutoSet flow generators to humidify and heat the air delivered to the patient. Their use helps prevent the drying of nasal passages
that can cause discomfort. Other optional accessories include cold passover humidifiers, carry bags and breathing circuits. MAP also offers a range of accessories, including the Twister remote, an intelligent remote control for use in the sleep
laboratory environment to set and monitor flow generators, the Aero-Click connection system, which allows a quick, simple connect/disconnect between the mask and CPAP air delivery source and the AeroFix headgear, for the comfortable adjustment of
masks for CPAP therapy. Since the May 2002 acquisition of Servo Magnetics Inc., we have sold custom electric motors, primarily for use in data storage and aerospace applications. But we do not expect custom electric motor sales to contribute
material revenues in the future.

Product Development and
Clinical Trials

We have a strong track record in
innovation in the sleep market. In 1989, we introduced our first CPAP device. Since then we have been committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development. Currently, our product development efforts are focused on not only
improving our current product offerings, but also expanding into new product applications. For example, in 1997, we introduced the Mirage Mask. This mask was based on the innovative Bubble Mask technology introduced in 1991, which used the principle
of air inflation of the mask cushion to create a more comfortable and better seal by better conforming to patient facial contours.

In 1999, we introduced the AutoSet T flow generator, an autotitrating device that adapts to the patient’s breathing patterns to effectively prevent
apneas. In 2001, we introduced our next generation autotitrating device, the AutoSet Spirit. The AutoSet Spirit is an autotitrating modular device with optional integrated humidifier. In September 2003 we introduced the Activa nasal mask using our
patented Active Cushion Technology, which automatically seals mask leaks. In August 2004, we launched an improved AutoSet CS 2 (outside the U.S. only) to treat congestive heart failure patients with significant central sleep apnea and also launched
our Mirage Swift mask, a light and unobtrusive nasal cannula mask system.

We continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs. SDB is associated with a number of symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness and irritability. Recent studies
have established a clinical association between SDB and hypertension, stroke, congestive heart failure, and diabetes. We support clinical trials in the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Swtizerland and Australia to develop
new clinical applications for our technology.

We consult with
physicians at major sleep centers throughout the world to identify technological trends in the treatment of SDB. Some of these physicians currently serve on our Medical Advisory Board. New product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff,
direct sales force, network of distributors, manufacturers’ representatives, customers, and patients. Typically, our internal development staff then develop these ideas, where appropriate, into new products.

In fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003 we invested $30.0 million, $26.2 million
and $20.5 million, respectively, on research and development.

Sales and Marketing

We currently market our
products in over 60 countries using a network of distributors, independent manufacturers’ representatives and our direct sales force. We attempt to tailor our marketing approach

- 13 -

to each national market, based on regional awareness of SDB as a health problem, physician referral patterns, consumer preferences and local reimbursement
policies.

North America and Latin
America.

Our products are typically purchased by a home health care dealer who then sells the products to the patient. The decision to purchase our products, as opposed those of our competitors, is made or influenced by
one or more of the following individuals or organizations: the prescribing physician and his or her staff; the home health care dealer; the insurer and the patient. In the United States, our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a
field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives, program development specialists, regional sales directors, and independent manufacturers’ representatives. Our United States field sales organization markets and sells
products to home health care dealer branch locations throughout the United States. Our direct sales force receives a base salary, plus commissions, while our independent sales representatives receive higher commissions, but no base salary.

We also promote and market our products directly to sleep
clinics. Patients who are diagnosed with OSA and prescribed CPAP treatment are typically referred by the diagnosing sleep clinic to a home health care dealer to fill the prescription. The home health care dealer, in consultation with the referring
physician, will assist the patient in selecting the equipment, fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the flow generator pressure to the prescribed level.

In the United States, our sales employees and manufacturers’ representatives are managed by the Chief Operating Officer
Americas and Vice President of Marketing. Our Canadian and Latin American sales are conducted through independent distributors. Sales in North and Latin America accounted for 51%, 49% and 48% of our net revenues for fiscal years 2005, 2004, and
2003, respectively.

Europe.

We
market our products in most major European countries. We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. We use independent distributors to sell our products in other areas of
Europe. Distributors are selected in each country based on their knowledge of respiratory medicine and a commitment to SDB therapy. In each country in which we have a subsidiary, a local senior manager is responsible for direct national sales. In
many countries in Europe, we sell our products to home health care dealers who then sell the products to the patients. In Germany, we also operate a home health care company, in which we provide products and services directly to patients, and
receive reimbursement directly from third party payers.

Our
European Chief Operating Officer is responsible for coordination of all European activities and, in conjunction with local management, the direct sales activity in Europe. Sales in Europe accounted for 41%, 43% and 42% of our total net revenues for
fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Asia
Pacific.

Marketing in Asia Pacific and the rest of the world is the responsibility of our Senior Vice President Sales & Marketing Asia Pacific. We have wholly–owned subsidiaries in Australia, Hong Kong,
Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand and Singapore. We use a combination of direct sales force and independent distributors in Australia and New Zealand, and use independent distributors to sell our products elsewhere in Asia Pacific. Sales in Asia Pacific
and the rest of the world accounted for 8%, 8% and 10% of our total net revenues for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Other Marketing Efforts.

In addition to our, and our distributors’ sales efforts, we work with the following
cardiovascular disease associations to raise awareness of the co-morbidity of SDB in

- 14 -

cardiovascular disease patients (cardiovascular disease includes coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension and stroke):

(i) American College of Cardiology.    We work with the
American College of Cardiology and its more than 20,000 cardiologist members to increase education and awareness in the cardiology community regarding the morbidity associated with sleep apnea in their patients. We have co-sponsored educational
symposia with Guidant Corp at ACC in 2003 and ACC 2004 on sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease. We have exhibited at ACC national conferences since 2001. Sleep apnea was included in the formal ACC scientific sessions in 2004.

(ii) American Heart Association.    We have worked with
the American Heart Association and we have attended the annual Scientific Sessions since 2001. Sleep apnea has been on the official program of the Scientific Sessions since 2002. We work with various regional and local AHA affiliates to increase
awareness regarding sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease.

(iii) Heart Failure Society of America.    We have attended the Heart Failure Society of America national conferences since 2002. We have co-sponsored CME-level educational symposia with Guidant at HFSA 2003 and HFSA
2004 on sleep apnea and heart failure. We continue to see a very high level of interest amongst heart failure physicians, due to the significant (approximately 50%) prevalence of sleep apnea in heart failure patients, and the outcome improvements in
blood pressure and ejection fraction observed in peer-reviewed studies using CPAP treatment.

Strategic Alliances

Guidant Corporation

.    The Guidant Corporation is a world leader in the treatment of cardiac and vascular disease. Guidant and ResMed have entered into an agreement pursuant to which the companies will work
together in the areas of sleep-disordered breathing and cardiac rhythm disorders, disease states with a significant patient population overlap. The companies plan to co-market to each other’s physician partners and customers, and to collaborate
on research and development projects, clinical studies, as well as physician and patient education.

MedCath Corporation.

MedCath develops, owns, and operates hospitals in partnership with cardiologists and cardiovascular
surgeons. Our alliance allows MedCath to offer SDB screening, diagnosis, and treatment in conjunction with services currently offered through the company’s cardiovascular diagnostic centers.

We believe that our affiliations and continued work with these organizations
raises the awareness of SDB as a significant health concern.

Manufacturing

Our principal manufacturing
facility is located in Sydney, Australia and comprises a 215,000 square foot manufacturing facility. Our manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly and testing of our flow generators, masks and accessories. Of the numerous raw materials,
parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products, most are off-the-shelf items available from multiple vendors. We generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as
received. Over the last few years, the manufacturing processes have been transformed along lean manufacturing guidelines to flow lines staffed by dedicated teams. Each team is responsible for manufacture and quality of their product group and
decisions are based on performance and quality measures including customer feedback.

Our quality management system is based upon the requirements of ISO 9001, EN46001 (European Medical Standards), FDA Quality System Regulations for Medical Devices (21 CFR part 820) and the

- 15 -

Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC). Our Sydney, Australia facility is accredited to ISO 9001 and EN46001 and our San Diego, California facility is
accredited to ISO 9002 and EN46002. These two sites have third party audits conducted by the ISO certification bodies at regular intervals.

Our German manufacturing operation based in Munich operates in a facility of approximately 24,000 square feet. This facility is accredited to ISO 9001 and
EN46001 and primarily assembles and tests flow generators for sale by our German subsidiary. Appropriate quality controls monitor and measure product assembly and performance.

As part of the acquisition of Saime SA on May 19, 2005, we also acquired a new 7,000 square feet manufacturing
facility. This facility is accredited to ISO 13485 and is primarily responsible for the assembly of the Saime brand of mechanical ventilators and associated accessories.

We also manufacture high quality electric motors for both our flow generator devices and external customers, primarily in
the data storage and aerospace sectors, at our Servo Magnetics Inc., or “SMI” facility at Canoga Park, California. The SMI facility is approximately 35,500 square feet.

Third-Party Reimbursement

The cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs. In
Germany, we receive payments directly from these payers. Outside Germany, although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payers, our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of patients to obtain
adequate reimbursement for our products.

In the United States,
our products are purchased primarily by home health care dealers, hospitals or sleep clinics, which then invoice third-party payers directly. Domestic third-party payers include Medicare, Medicaid, and corporate health insurance plans. These payers
may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, or is experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. The long-term trend towards managed health care, or legislative proposals to
reform health care, could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products and could result in lower prices for our products.

Even though we do not file claims or bill governmental programs and other third-party payers directly for reimbursement for
our products sold in the United States, we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental programs, and any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties, including fines. In particular, the
federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending or arranging
for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a Federal health care program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and
distributors like us. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Law. We are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any third-party payer. These laws prohibit persons from knowingly and
willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payers. These laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage, coding and
reimbursement of their products to persons who bill third-party payers. We continuously strive to comply with these laws and believe that our arrangements do not violate these laws. Liability may still arise from the intentions or actions of the
parties with whom we do business or from a different governmental agency interpretation of the laws.

- 16 -

In some foreign markets, such as Spain, France and Germany, government reimbursement is currently
available for purchase or rental of our products, however, subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations. In Australia and in some other foreign markets, there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat
OSA.

Service and Warranty

We generally offer one-year and two-year limited warranties on our flow
generator products. Warranties on mask systems are for 90 days. In most markets, we rely on our distributors to repair our products with parts supplied by us. In the United States, home health care dealers generally arrange shipment of products to
our San Diego facility for repair.

We receive returns of our
products from the field for various reasons. We believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices. We provide for warranties and returns based on historical
data.

Competition

The markets for our products are highly competitive. We believe that the
principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features, reliability and price. Customer support, reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors.

We compete on a market-by-market basis with various companies, some of which have greater financial, research, manufacturing
and marketing resources than ourselves. In the United States, our principal market, Respironics, Inc., DeVilbiss, a division of Sunrise Medical Inc., and Nellcor Puritan Bennett, a subsidiary of Tyco Inc., and Fisher & Paykell Healthcare
Corporation Limited are the primary competitors for our CPAP products. Our principal European competitors are also Respironics, DeVilbiss, and Nellcor Puritan Bennett, as well as regional European manufacturers. The disparity between our resources
and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the health care industry. In addition, our products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed to treat OSA and other SDB related
respiratory conditions. The development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive, which would harm our revenues and financial condition.

Any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to
compete for market acceptance and market share. An important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing
and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors. In addition, our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on the extent to which we are successful in
protecting our patents and other intellectual property.

Patents and Proprietary Rights and Related Litigation

Through our subsidiaries ResMed Limited, Medizintechnik fur Arzt und Patient GmbH, SMI and Saime SA, we own or have licensed rights to 192 issued United States patents (including 56 design patents) and 242 issued foreign patents. In
addition, there are 182 pending United States patent applications (including 41 design patent applications), 369 pending foreign patent applications, 312 registered foreign designs and 107 pending foreign designs. Some of these patents, patent
applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products.

Of our patents, nine United States patents and four foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years, with one foreign patent due to expire in each of the years 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2010 and one United States
patent in 2005, two United States patents in 2007, four United States patents in 2008 and two United States patents in 2010. We believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position.

- 17 -

We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and non-disclosure agreements
to protect our proprietary technology and rights.

Litigation
may be necessary to attempt to enforce patents issued to us, to protect our rights, or to defend third-party claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others. Patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to
country. Therefore, there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved, or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits.

Government Regulations

Our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety, efficacy and adherence to FDA Quality System Regulation, and related
manufacturing standards. Medical device products are subject to rigorous FDA and other governmental agency regulations in the United States and regulations of relevant foreign agencies abroad. The FDA regulates the introduction, manufacture,
advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution, and record keeping for such products, in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the United States are safe and effective for their intended use. In addition, the FDA is
authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions, fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspensions
or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, and criminal prosecution.

The FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a
new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval, or PMA, before introducing it into the U.S. market. Our products currently marketed in the United
States are marketed in reliance on 510(k) pre-marketing clearances as either Class I or Class II devices. The process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data, which
in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the FDA to be “substantially equivalent” to such a
pre-1976 device. As a result, FDA approval requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time. In addition, in some cases, the FDA may require additional review by an advisory panel, which can further lengthen the
process. The PMA process, which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for high-risk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life, may take several years and requires the
submission of extensive performance and clinical information.

As a medical device manufacturer, all of our domestic and Australian manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA. We believe that our design, manufacturing and quality control procedures are in
substantial compliance with the FDA’s regulatory requirements. MAP’s and Saime’s facilities are not subject to FDA regulation, because none of their products are currently marketed in the United States.

Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to regulatory
requirements that vary widely from country to country. Approval for sale of our medical devices in Europe is through the CE mark process. Where appropriate, our products are CE marked to the European Union’s Medical Device Directive. Under the
CE marketing scheme, our products are classified as either Class I or Class II; our devices are listed in the United States with FDA; in Australia with the Therapeutic Goods Administration, or TGA; and in Canada with Health Canada.

- 18 -

On August 16, 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized ResMed to market its VPAP Adapt
SV device in the United States. The device is indicated for use to provide non-invasive ventilatory support to treat adult patients with OSA and respiratory insufficiency caused by central and/or mixed apneas and periodic breathing. ResMed does not
expect to sell material quantities of the VPAP Adapt SV until the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, or later.

Employees

As of June 30, 2005, we had 1,927 employees or full time consultants, of which 728 persons were employed in warehousing and manufacturing, 255 in
research and development, 944 in sales, marketing and administration. Of our employees and consultants, 952 were located in Australia, 429 in the United States, 530 in Europe and 16 in Asia.

We believe that the success of our business will depend, in part, on our
ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.

ROCEEDINGS

The Company was engaged in litigation relating to the enforcement and defense of certain of its patents during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005.

2005 Litigation.

On
December 23, 2002 three former contractors of our subsidiary MAP Medizin-Technologie GmbH initiated proceedings in Munich 1 Regional Court (Proceedings No. 7 O 23286/02), petitioning the Court for a declaration of inventorship with respect
to MAP German Patent Applications identified as No. 100 31 079 and 101 92 802.5 and European Patent Application No. EP 01 967 819.7. On March 10, 2005 the Court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, finding that they should be identified
as co-inventors in place of certain individual defendants. In April 2005, MAP filed an appeal of that decision. We do not expect the outcome of this litigation to have an adverse material effect on us.

- 21 -

Other Litigation.

In addition to the matters described above, in the normal
course of business, we are subject to routine litigation incidental to our business. While the results of this litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that their final outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

Overview

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and
consolidated financial statements and notes, included herein.

We design, manufacture and market equipment for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea. Our net revenues are generated from the sale and rental of our various flow generator
devices, nasal mask systems, accessories and other products, and, to a lesser extent from royalties and sales of custom motors.

We have invested significant resources in research and development and product enhancement. Since 1989, we have developed several innovations to the
original CPAP device to increase patient comfort and to improve ease of product use. We have been developing products for automated treatment, titration and monitoring of OSA, such as the AutoSet T and AutoSet Spirit flow generators. We have also
developed numerous innovations associated with our mask product offerings and they now form a significant part of our product portfolio.

Business Acquisitions

Fiscal year ended June 30, 2005

Saime SA (“Saime”).

On May 19, 2005 we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Financiere ACE SAS, the
holding company for Saime SA and its affiliates, for net cash consideration of $40.5 million. This was comprised of $51.0 million in consideration, including acquisition costs, less $10.5 million of cash acquired. Additionally, as part of the
acquisition we assumed (and immediately repaid) debt of $65.8 million. The acquisition and the immediate repayment of the assumed debt was funded with cash on hand and a five-year secured loan of 50 million Euro, equivalent to $62.7 million,
from HSBC Bank Australia Limited.

Saime is a leading developer
of ventilation products and distributes its products directly in France and Germany and through a network of distributors in Europe and Asia-Pacific.

The acquisition has been accounted for using purchase accounting and has been included in the company’s operations since the date of acquisition. The
company has not yet completed the purchase price allocation as the appraisals associated with the valuation of certain tangible assets are not yet complete. The company does not believe that the appraisals will materially modify the preliminary
purchase price allocation. We expect to complete our purchase price allocation in the six months ended December 31, 2005.

- 26 -

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
from Saime at the date of acquisition based on an independent appraisal and internal studies (in thousands):

Since its
formation in 1987, Saime has developed a complete range of ventilators for use in the home and hospital markets. Saime distributes its products directly in France and Germany and through a network of distributors in Europe and Asia Pacific. Saime
develops, manufactures and markets products from its headquarters near Paris, with a staff of approximately 100.

The company believes that the Saime acquisition resulted in the recognition of goodwill primarily because of its industry position and management
strength. In addition, Saime’s products complete our line of homecare ventilation products and will immediately expand our market presence and distribution network in Europe and other regions. The Saime devices will complement our VPAPIII and
Autoset CS devices and will allow us to provide the full range of options for patients who need ventilatory assistance.

Hoefner Medizintechnick GmbH (“Hoefner”).

On February 14, 2005 we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of
Hoefner Medizintechnick GmbH (“Hoefner”), for net cash consideration of $8.2 million. This was comprised of the $10.7 million in total consideration, including acquisition costs, less $2.5 million of cash acquired. Under the purchase
agreement, we may also be required to make additional future payments of up to $0.9 million based on the achievement of certain performance milestones following the acquisition through December 31, 2006. Hoefner is a German-based company that
distributes medical equipment and associated services for the treatment of sleep and respiratory patients. Hoefner was our Bavarian distributor before the acquisition, and the acquisition is consistent with our strategy for ongoing expansion of our
international operations. We have been particularly successful in selling directly in Europe. We believe selling directly improves our understanding of local markets as well as our relationships with physicians and payers. The acquisition also
brings us into closer contact with patients and allows us to more directly respond to their needs.

- 27 -

The acquisition has been accounted for using purchase accounting and has been included within our
consolidated financial statements from February 14, 2005. An amount of $8.2 million, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired of $2.5 million, has been recorded as goodwill.

The cost of the acquisition was allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The fair values were determined by an independent appraisal and internal studies. The following table summarizes the final purchase price
allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Hoefner at the date of acquisition (in thousands):

Resprecare
BV.

On December 1, 2004 we acquired substantially all the assets of Resprecare BV, our Dutch distributor, for initial consideration of $5.9 million in cash, including acquisition costs. The acquisition of the
exclusive Dutch distributor is consistent with our strategy for ongoing expansion of our international operations. Under the purchase agreement, we potentially were also required to make up to $1.4 million of additional future payments based on the
achievement of certain milestones. Of these potential additional payments, $0.6 million was paid in January 2005 as a result of the successful achievement of a performance milestone and a further $0.7 million was accrued at June 30, 2005 as a
result of the integration of the Dutch subsidiary of our subsidiary MAP with the newly-acquired Resprecare business. The decision to integrate these operations determined the amount of the final future payment, which will be paid in January 2006.

The acquisition has been accounted for using purchase
accounting and accordingly, the results of operations of Resprecare have been included within our consolidated financial statements from December 1, 2004. An amount of $4.4 million, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of identifiable net assets acquired of $2.8 million, has been recorded as goodwill, which will be tax deductible. An independent third party has completed a valuation of identifiable intangible assets associated with the Resprecare
acquisition. As a result of this valuation, $1.7 million that was preliminarily allocated to goodwill has been recorded as a customer relationship intangible asset and is being amortized over its estimated useful life of seven years.

- 28 -

We expect that the acquisitions of Resprecare, Hoefner and Saime will not have a significant impact on
the historical relationship of our gross profit, selling, general and administrative expense and research and development expense, expressed as a percentage of our net revenue.

Fiscal year ended June 30, 2004

Respro Medical Company Limited (“Respro”).

On July 2, 2003 we acquired the
assets of Respro Medical Company Limited (“Respro”), our Hong Kong distributor for total consideration of $184,000 in cash. The acquisition has been accounted for using purchase accounting and accordingly, the results of operations of
Respro have been included within our consolidated financial statements from July 2, 2003. An amount of $89,000, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired of $95,000, has been recorded
as goodwill.

Fiscal year ended June 30, 2003

John Stark and
Associates.

On July 24, 2002 we acquired the business of John Stark and Associates, our Texas representative, for total consideration of $300,000 in cash. The acquisition has been accounted for using purchase
accounting and accordingly, the results of operations of John Stark and Associates were included within our consolidated financial statements from July 24, 2002. An amount of $300,000, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of net identifiable assets acquired of $nil, has been recorded as goodwill.

In-Process Research and Development Charge (IPR&D)

On acquisition of Saime in May 2005, we recognized as an expense a charge of $5.3 million with respect to IPR&D programs under active development by Saime that, at date of acquisition, had not reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The estimated fair value assigned to IPR&D was based on an independent appraisal and was comprised of the following projects (in thousands):

The value of
IPR&D was calculated by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established, estimating the costs to develop the purchased in-process technology into commercially viable products, estimating the
resulting net cash flows from such products, discounting the net cash flows to present value, and applying the reduced percentage completion of the projects thereto. The discount rate used in the analysis was 25%, which was based on the risk profile
of the acquired assets.

As of the date of acquisition, these
projects have estimated costs to complete totaling approximately $1.1 million. The projects were in various stages of development but are expected to reach completion at various dates ranging from 1 to 3 years.

We believe that the assumptions used to value the acquired intangible assets
were reasonable at the time of acquisition. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project revenues, development costs or profitability, or events associated with such projects, will transpire
as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary from the projected results.

- 29 -

Tax Expense

Our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized. To date, a substantial portion
of our income has been subject to income tax in Australia where the statutory rate was 30% in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003. During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, our effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately 31% and approximately 33%. These
fluctuations have resulted from, and future effective tax rates will depend upon, numerous factors, including the amount of research and development expenditures for which a 125% Australian tax deduction is available, the level of non-deductible
expenses, and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws.

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2005 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2004

Net Revenues.

Net revenue increased for the
year ended June 30, 2005 to $425.5 million from $339.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2004, an increase of $86.2 million or 25%. The increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators, masks
and accessories. Sales also benefited from an appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar (increasing sales by approximately $10.4 million). Net revenue in North and Latin America increased for the year ended June 30, 2005
to $218.1 million from $166.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2004, an increase of $52.0 million or 31%. This growth has been generated by increased public and physician awareness of sleep-disordered breathing together with our continued
investment in our sales force and marketing initiatives. Product releases during the year, in particular our Mirage Swift mask, have also contributed strongly to our sales growth.

Net revenue in markets outside the Americas increased for the year ended June 30, 2005 to $207.4 million from $173.2
million for the years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 respectively, an increase of 20%. International sales growth for the year ended June 30, 2005 reflects organic growth in the overall sleep-disordered breathing market, appreciation of
international currencies against the U.S. dollar and the acquisition during the year of Resprecare, Hoefner and Saime. These acquisitions contributed incremental revenue of $11.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2005. Excluding the impact of
acquisitions, international sales grew by 13%.

Sales of flow
generators for the year ended June 30, 2005 totaled $209.8 million, an increase of 24% compared to the year ended June 30, 2004, including increases of 22% in North and Latin America and 25% elsewhere. Sales of mask systems, motors and
other accessories totaled $215.7 million, an increase of 27%, including increases of 38% in North and Latin America and 12% elsewhere, for the year ended June 30, 2005, compared to the year ended June 30, 2004. These increases primarily
reflect growth in the overall sleep-disordered breathing market, acquisitions during the year, appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar and new product releases.

Gross Profit.

Gross profit increased for the year ended June 30, 2005 to $274.9 million
from $216.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2004, an increase of $58.2 million or 27%. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased for the year ended June 30, 2005 to 65% from 64% for the year ended June 30, 2004. The
improvement in gross margin reflects a more favorable product mix due to increased sales of higher margin mask products and new product introductions.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.

Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased for the year ended June 30, 2005 to $135.7 million from $104.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2004, an increase of $31.0 million or 30%. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and
administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2005 was 32%, marginally higher than 31% in the year ended June 30, 2004. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of
sales and administrative personnel to support our growth, the acquisitions of Resprecare, Hoefner and Saime, continued infrastructure investment, particularly in our European businesses, and other expenses related to the increase in our sales. The
increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was also attributable to appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar, which added approximately $4.0 million to our expenses as reported in U.S. dollars. As a percentage
of net revenue, we expect our future selling, general and administrative expense to continue in the historical range of 31% to 33%.

Donations to Foundations.

In the years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 we donated $0.5 million and $0.5 million,
respectively, to the ResMed Foundation in the U.S., and the Resmed Foundation Limited in Australia. The Foundation’s overall mission includes the education of both the public and physicians about the inherent dangers of untreated SDB/OSA,
particularly as it relates to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease.

Research and Development Expenses.

Research and development expenses increased for the year ended June 30, 2005 to $30.0 million from $26.2 million for the year ended June 30,
2004, an increase of $3.8 million or 15%. As a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 7% for the year ended June 30, 2005 compared to 8% for the year ended June 30, 2004. The increase in research and development
expenses was primarily due to higher employee compensation and increased charges for consulting fees and technical assessments incurred to facilitate development of new products. The increase also reflects an appreciation of the Australian dollar
against the U.S. dollar, as the majority of research and development costs are incurred in Australian dollars. The appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar added approximately $1.3 million to our research and development
expenses as reported in U.S. dollars. As a percentage of net revenue, we expect our future research and development expense to continue in the range of 5% to 7%.

In-process Research and Development Charge.

Purchased in-process research and development of
$5.3 million was expensed upon acquisition of Saime as technological feasibility of the products under development had not been established and no further alternative uses existed. The nature of this charge is explained more fully in note 20 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Amortization of Acquired
Intangible Assets.

Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended June 30, 2005 totaled $0.9 million ($nil for the year ended June 30, 2004) and related to acquired intangible assets totaling $46.0
million associated with the acquisitions of Saime, Hoefner and Resprecare.

Restructure.

Restructuring expenses incurred for the year ended June 30, 2005 were $5.2 million and consisted of restructure charges associated with our integration of the separate
operations of ResMed Germany and MAP into a single operating unit. We have completed the relocation of our ResMed Germany operation, previously located in Moenchengladbach, to Munich and associated integration of the back office functions including
customer service, logistics and administration. We will continue to monitor the progress of this restructure and adjust our business strategies and personnel accordingly to achieve maximum efficiencies and cost savings.

Other Income (Expense), Net.

Other expense, net
for the year ended June 30, 2005 was $0.7 million, consistent with the year ended June 30, 2004. In fiscal year 2005, other expense, net reflected lower net foreign currency exchange gains, partially offset by lower interest expense due to
the reduction in our convertible note debt that occurred in the 2004 fiscal year.

- 31 -

Income Taxes.

Our effective income tax rate increased to approximately 33%
for the year ended June 30, 2005 from approximately 32% for the year ended June 30, 2004. However, adding back the impact of the non-deductible in-process research and development charge of $5.3 million taken in the year ended
June 30, 2005 would result in an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 31%. The lower adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to our geographical mix of taxable income. In particular, we continue to benefit from the Australian
corporate tax rate of 30% and certain Australian R&D tax benefits because we generate a majority of our taxable income in Australia.

Net Income.

As a result of the factors above, our net income for the year ended June 30, 2005 was $64.8 million or
$1.82 per diluted share compared to net income of $57.3 million or $1.63 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2004. The restructuring expenses, in-process research and development charge and amortization of acquired intangible assets
described above constituted a reduction of $0.24 and $0.00 per diluted share on an after-tax basis, respectively, for the years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004.

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2004 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2003

Net Revenues.

Net revenue increased for the
year ended June 30, 2004 to $339.3 million from $273.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2003, an increase of $65.7 million or 24%.

The increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators, masks and accessories. Sales also benefited from an
appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar (increasing sales by approximately $18.6 million). Net revenue in North and Latin America increased to $166.1 million from $130.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2004 and
2003 respectively. This growth primarily reflects increased public and physician awareness of sleep-disordered breathing. Net revenue in international markets increased to $173.2 million from $142.8 million for the years ended June 30, 2004 and
2003 respectively. International sales growth for the year ended June 30, 2004 reflects organic growth in the overall sleep-disordered breathing market and appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar.

Sales for the previous year ended June 30, 2003 included non-recurring
SARS-related sales to China of approximately $5.0 million. Excluding the impact of these sales, international sales grew by 26%. Excluding both the impacts of the appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar and SARS-related
sales, international sales grew by 12%.

Sales of flow
generators for the year ended June 30, 2004 increased by 18% compared to the year ended June 30, 2003, including increases of 20% in North and Latin America and 16% elsewhere. Sales of mask systems, motors and other accessories increased
by 31%, including increases of 33% in North and Latin America and 29% elsewhere, for the year ended June 30, 2004 compared to the year ended June 30, 2003. These increases primarily reflect growth in the overall sleep-disordered breathing
market and appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar.

Gross Profit.

Gross profit increased for the year ended June 30, 2004 to $216.7 million from $173.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2003, an increase of $43.6 million or
25%. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased for the year ended June 30, 2004 to 64% from 63% for the year ended June 30, 2003. The small improvement in gross margin reflects a more favorable product mix due to increased
sales of higher margin products, partially offset by the impact of higher manufacturing costs resulting from a stronger Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar, as the majority of manufacturing labor and overhead costs are incurred in Australia.

Selling, General and Administrative
Expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended June 30, 2004 to $104.7 million from $85.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2003, an increase of $19.4 million or 23%. As a
percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2004 was 31%, consistent with the year

- 32 -

ended June 30, 2003. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and
administrative personnel and other expenses related to the increase in our sales. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was also attributable to appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar which added
approximately $8.1 million to our expenses as reported in U.S. dollars.

Donations to Foundation.

In the year ended June 30, 2004 we donated $0.5 million to the ResMed Foundation in the U.S., and the Resmed Foundation Limited in Australia. The Foundation’s overall mission
includes the education of both the public and physicians about the inherent dangers of untreated SDB/OSA, particularly as it relates to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease.

Research and Development Expenses.

Research and development expenses increased for the year
ended June 30, 2004 to $26.2 million from $20.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2003, an increase of $5.7 million or 28%. As a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 7.7% for the year ended June 30, 2004
compared to 7.5% for the year ended June 30, 2003. The increase in research and development expenses was due to increased salaries associated with an increase in personnel and increased charges for consulting fees, clinical trials and technical
assessments incurred to facilitate development of new products. The increase also reflects an appreciation of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar, as the majority of research and development costs are incurred in Australian dollars.

The appreciation of international currencies against the U.S.
dollar added approximately $3.8 million to our research and development expenses as reported in U.S. dollars.

Other Income (Expense), Net.

Other expense, net increased for the year ended June 30, 2004 to net expense of $0.7
million from net expense of $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2003. The increase in other expense was attributable to no gains on extinguishment of debt this year compared to $0.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2003, and lower
net foreign currency exchange gains, partially offset by lower interest expense due to the reduction in convertible note debt.

Income Taxes.

Our effective income tax rate increased to 32.3% for the year ended June 30, 2004 from 31.9% for the year
ended June 30, 2003. The marginally higher tax rate was primarily due to the geographical mix of taxable income. We continue to benefit from the Australian corporate tax rate of 30%, because we generate a majority of our taxable income in
Australia.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of June 30, 2005 and June 30, 2004, we had cash and cash
equivalents and marketable securities available-for-sale of $142.2 million and $140.9 million, respectively. Working capital was $141.7 million and $222.2 million at June 30, 2005 and June 30, 2004 respectively. The reduction in working
capital predominantly reflects the classification of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due June 20, 2006 from a non- current liability as at June 30, 2004, to a current liability as at June 30, 2005.

Inventories at June 30, 2005 increased by $33.3 million or 60% to $89.1
million compared to June 30, 2004 inventories of $55.8 million. Excluding the incremental inventories from acquisitions, our inventories increased by $22.0 million or 39%. This percentage increase in inventories was higher than the increase of
25% in revenues in the year ended June 30, 2005 compared to the year ended June 30, 2004. The higher inventory growth reflects management’s decision to increase inventory levels, particularly in raw materials, to accommodate our
increasing production volumes. In addition to this, raw material inventories have increased to support production of our recently launched S8 flow generator. Accounts receivable at June 30, 2005 were $104.0 million, an increase of $36.8

- 33 -

million or 55% over the June 30, 2004 accounts receivable balance of $67.2 million. Excluding the incremental increase from acquisitions, our accounts
receivables have increased by $27.3 million or 41%. This increase was higher than the 25% incremental increase in revenues for the year ended June 30, 2005 compared to the year ended June 30, 2004. The deterioration in ageing largely
reflects higher than normal receivable balances relative to sales in Germany as delays in processing of invoices have also resulted in timing of collections being delayed. Accounts receivable days outstanding increased to 71 days for the year ended
June 30, 2005, compared to 64 days for the year ended June 30, 2004. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total accounts receivable at June 30, 2005 and 2004 was 3.0% and 4.5%, respectively. The credit quality of our
customers remains consistent with our past experience.

During
the year ended June 30, 2005, we generated cash of $71.1 million from operations. This was lower than the cash generated from operations for the year ended June 30, 2004 of $76.5 million and primarily reflects the increase in inventory and
receivables attributable to the factors described above.

Capital expenditures for the years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 aggregated $39.7 million and $57.2 million respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2005, $23.5 million of the expenditure related to the construction of our new
manufacturing facility. The capital expenditures in the year ended June 30, 2005 primarily reflected the construction of our new manufacturing, research and development building, office facilities, computer hardware and software, rental and
loan equipment and purchase of production tooling equipment and machinery. As a result of these capital expenditures, our balance sheet reflects net property, plant and equipment of approximately $174.2 million at June 30, 2005 compared to
$147.3 million at June 30, 2004.

We are currently
building our new research and development and office facilities at our existing site in Sydney, Australia and expect this to be completed by the second half of calendar 2006. We estimate that the additional building costs for the new research and
development and office facilities will be approximately $49.0 million. We expect to fund the project through a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.

On May 16, 2005 we obtained a five-year loan of 50 million Euro, equivalent to $62.7 million, from HSBC Bank
Australia Limited, to fund the acquisition of Saime SA.

On
July 7, 2005, we purchased a 9.78-acre parcel of land in San Diego for $21.0 million. The new location at Kearney Mesa, San Diego will allow us to develop a new corporate headquarters. We expect to commence building during calendar year 2006
and begin moving into the facility in calendar 2007. As part of the funding of the purchase we drew down $10.0 million from our existing $15.0 million revolving line of credit with Union Bank of California.

Details of contractual obligations at June 30, 2005 are as follows:

- 34 -

Details of other commercial commitments at June 30, 2005 are as follows:

*

The
above guarantees relate to guarantees required by statutory authorities as a pre-requisite to developing our site at Norwest and requirements under contractual obligations with insurance companies transacting with our German subsidiaries.

We expect to satisfy all of our short-term liquidity
requirements through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations and a $5.0 million undrawn revolving line of credit with Union Bank of California. Beyond this, we are currently reviewing our funding needs and existing facilities
to provide flexibility for future business needs and facilitate the refinancing of our convertible notes should they not convert to common stock before maturity on June 20, 2006.

During the year ended June 30, 2005, we did not repurchase any convertible subordinated notes. Our convertible
subordinated notes are due to mature on June 20, 2006.

We
may from time to time seek to retire our convertible subordinated notes through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any,
will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, and our current or future contractual obligations, if any, that may directly or indirectly apply to such transactions.

The results of our international operations are affected by changes in
exchange rates between currencies. Changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated net revenue and gross profit margins from international operations. We are exposed to the risk that the dollar value equivalent of anticipated cash
flows would be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage this risk through foreign currency option contracts.

Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, including those related to
allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, warranty obligations, goodwill, impaired assets, intangible assets, income taxes, deferred tax valuation allowances and contingencies.

We state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and
analysis. The estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.

We believe that the following
critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:

(1)    Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.    We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments, which

- 35 -

results in bad debt expense. We determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables, considering a
customer’s financial condition, credit history and current economic conditions. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be
required.

(2)    Inventory
Adjustments.    Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the first-in, first-out method. We review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on
estimated future usage and sales. The likelihood of any material inventory write-downs is dependent on changes in competitive conditions, new product introductions by us or our competitors, or rapid changes in customer demand.

(3)    Valuation of Goodwill, Intangible and Other
Long-Lived Assets.    We use assumptions in establishing the carrying value, fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets. The criteria used for these evaluations include
management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset, as well as the strategic significance of any
identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives. If assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Useful lives and related
amortization or depreciation expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. Factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include
significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow, loss of legal ownership or title to the asset, a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends, significant changes in our
strategic business objectives, utilization of the asset, and a significant change in the economic and/or political conditions in certain countries.

(4)    Valuation of Deferred Income Taxes.    Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable
income, the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in, and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations.

(5)    Provision for Warranty.    We
provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The amount of this provision is determined by using a financial model, which takes into consideration actual, historical expenses and potential risks
associated with our different products. This financial model is then used to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision. Although we engage in product improvement programs and
processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures. Should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates,
revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required.

(6)    Revenue Recognition.    Revenue on product sales is recorded at the time of shipment, at which time title transfers to the customer. Revenue on product sales which require customer acceptance
is not recorded until acceptance is received. Royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded when earned. Service revenue received in advance from service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the service
contract. Revenue received in advance from rental unit contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract. Revenue from sale of marketing and distribution rights is initially deferred and recognized ratably
as revenue over the life of the contract. Freight charges billed to customers are included in revenue. All freight-related expenses are charged to cost of sales.

We do not offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products or similarly offer variable
sale prices for subsequent events or activities. However, as part of our sales processes

- 36 -

we may provide upfront discounts for large orders, one time special pricing to support new product introductions, sales rebates for centralized purchasing
entities or price-breaks for regular order volumes. The costs of all such programs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue. In our domestic sales activities we use a number of Manufacturer Representatives to sell our products. These representatives
are paid a direct commission on sales and act as an integral component of our domestic sales force. We do not sell our products to these representatives, and do not recognize revenue on such shipments. Our products are predominantly therapy-based
equipment and require no installation. As such, we have no significant installation obligations.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, (“FASB”), issued SFAS 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”, which is a revision
of SFAS 123. Generally, the approach in SFAS 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income
statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative. This statement also eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using APB Opinion No. 25. The statement, which was
delayed, is effective at the beginning of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. Early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued. The accounting provision SFAS 123(R) is effective
beginning in our interim period ending September 30, 2005.

SFAS 123(R) permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods: (1) A “modified prospective” method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the
requirements of SFAS 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees before the effective date of SFAS 123(R) that remain unvested on the
effective date; or (2) A “modified retrospective” method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS
123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either (a) all prior periods presented or (b) prior interim periods of the year of adoption. We expect to adopt the modified prospective method.

As permitted by SFAS 123, we currently account for share-based payments to
employees using Opinion 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options, which are granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of
grant. We are currently reviewing the impact of the adoption of SFAS 123(R) however we expect the adoption of SFAS 123(R) will have a significant impact on our results of operations.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, (“FASB”), issued SFAS 153, “Exchanges of
Non-monetary Assets, an Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29,’ Accounting for Non-monetary Transactions’.” The amendments are based on the principle that exchanges of non-monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the
assets exchanged. SFAS 153 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005, however earlier application is permitted for non-monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after the date of issuance. The provisions
of this statement will be applied prospectively. We do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), issued SFAS 151, “Inventory Costs”,
which sought to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage. SFAS 151 also requires that the allocation of fixed

- 37 -

production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal operating capacity of the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Foreign Currency Market Risk

Our functional
currency is the U.S. dollar, although the financial statements of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are maintained in their respective local currencies. We transact business in various foreign currencies, including a number of major European currencies as
well as the Australian dollar. We have significant foreign currency exposure through both our Australian manufacturing activities and international sales operations.

We have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased currency options to hedge
foreign-currency-denominated financial assets, liabilities and manufacturing expenditure. The goal of this hedging program is to economically guarantee or lock-in the exchange rates on our foreign currency exposures denominated in Euro’s and
the Australian dollar. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated financial assets, liabilities, and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments. We have determined our
hedge program to be a non-effective hedge as defined under SFAS 133. The foreign currency derivatives portfolio is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and included in other assets or other liabilities. All movements in the fair
value of the foreign currency derivatives are recorded within other income, net on our consolidated statements of income.

- 38 -

The table below provides information (in U.S. dollars) on our foreign-currency-denominated financial
assets by legal entity functional currency as of June 30, 2005 (in thousands):

- 39 -

The table below provides information about our foreign currency derivative financial instruments and
presents the information in U.S. dollar equivalents. The table summarizes information on instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates, including foreign currency call options held at June 30, 2005. The
table presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by contractual maturity dates for our foreign currency derivative financial instruments. These notional amounts generally are used to calculate payments to be exchanged under
the options contracts.

Interest Rate
Risk

We are exposed to risk associated with changes in
interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents and debt. At June 30, 2005 we had total long-term debt, including the current portion of those obligations, of $174.4 million. Of this debt, $113.9 million is at fixed
interest rates and $60.5 million is subject to variable interest rates.

A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during the twelve months ended June 30, 2005, would not have a material impact on pretax income. We have no interest rate hedging agreements.

Forward-Looking Statements

This report on Form 10-K contains or may contain certain forward-looking
statements and information that are based on our management’s beliefs, as well as on estimates and assumptions made by, and information currently available to our management. The words “believe,” “expect,”
“anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “future” and other similar expressions generally identify forward-looking statements, including, in particular, statements regarding the development and approval of new
products and product applications, market expansion, pending litigation and the development of new markets for our products, such as the cardiovascular and stroke markets. These forward-looking statements are made under the safe harbor provisions of
the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should not unduly rely on these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect the views of our management at the time the statements are made and are subject to a number
of risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions, including, without limitation, and in addition to those identified in the text surrounding such statements, those identified under the caption “Risk Factors” below and elsewhere in this
report. In addition, important factors to consider in evaluating such forward-looking statements include changes or developments in social, economic, market, legal or regulatory circumstances, changes in our business or growth strategy or an
inability to execute our strategy due to changes in our industry or the economy generally, the emergence of

- 40 -

new or growing competitors, the actions or omissions of third parties, including suppliers, customers, competitors and governmental authorities, and various
other factors. Should any one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or the underlying estimates or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from those expressed in such forward-looking statements, and there
can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this report will in fact occur.

Risk Factors

The risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations include the following:

Our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our
business.

The markets for our sleep-disordered breathing products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology. Our ability to compete successfully depends, in part,
on our ability to develop, manufacture and market innovative new products. The development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could
make our products noncompetitive or obsolete.

Additionally,
some of our competitors have greater financial, research and development, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. The past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the health care industry and in the markets for our
products. Industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources or if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours. This competition could increase pressure on us to
reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing. If we are unable to develop innovative new products, maintain competitive pricing, and offer products that
consumers perceive to be as reliable as those of our competitors, our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business.

Our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home health care products and sleep clinics.

We
market our products primarily to home health care dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep disorders. We believe that home health care dealers and sleep clinics play a significant role in determining which
brand of product a patient will use. The success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to home health care dealers and sleep clinics to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these third parties.

We have limited resources to market to approximately 3,000
U.S. sleep clinics and the more than 6,000 home health care dealer branch locations, most of which use, sell or recommend several brands of products. In addition, home health care dealers have experienced price pressures as government and
third-party reimbursement have declined for home care products, and home health care dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us. We cannot assure you that sleep clinic physicians will
continue to prescribe our products, or that home health care dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written.

We have expanded our marketing activities to target the population with a predisposition to sleep- disordered breathing as
well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists. We cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products.

Any inability to effectively market our products outside the U.S. could impact our
profitability.

Approximately half our revenues are generated outside the U.S., in approximately 60 different countries. Many of these countries have unique regulatory, medical, and business environments. If we are unable
to effectively market our products outside the U.S., our overall financial performance could decline.

- 41 -

If we are unable to support our continued growth, our business could
suffer.

We have experienced rapid and substantial growth. As we continue to grow, the complexity of our operations increases, placing greater demands on our management. Our ability to manage our growth effectively depends
on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business. Unexpected difficulties during expansion, the failure to attract and retain qualified employees,
the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems, the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop. If we fail to manage our
growth, our business could suffer.

If we fail to integrate
our recent acquisitions with our operations, our business could suffer.

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 we acquired Saime SA, Hoefner and Resprecare. We are currently in the process of integrating our
operations with these recent acquisitions. The integration will require significant efforts from each company. We may find it difficult to integrate the operations as personnel may leave, licensees, distributors or suppliers may terminate their
arrangements, or demand amended terms to these arrangements. Additionally, our management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate these companies. This diversion or these difficulties in integration could have an adverse impact
on us. If we are not able to successfully integrate the operations, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions

If we fail to properly implement restructure plans, our business could suffer.

We recently merged the operations of ResMed
Germany and MAP into a single operating unit as part of our German restructure plan. We have relocated our ResMed Germany operations to Munich, and are integrating the back office functions, including customer service, logistics and administration.
We will continue to monitor the progress of this restructure and adjust our business strategies and personnel accordingly to achieve maximum efficiencies, cost savings and success. If we are not able to successfully integrate the operations we may
not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the restructure.

Changes in assumptions used in the purchase accounting of our recent acquisitions may impact our future operating results.

The acquisitions have been accounted for using purchase accounting and accordingly have
been included in the company’s operations since the date of acquisition. We allocate the purchase price according to the fair value of assets and liabilities assumed, intangible assets and in process research and development as at the date of
acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of acquired net assets is recorded as goodwill. We utilize independent appraisals with our own internal studies and management assumptions to estimate the fair values. If our
estimates change due to inaccurate assumptions or other circumstances our future financial results maybe impacted. This may result in goodwill becoming impaired and changes to the amount of amortization charges of certain identifiable intangible
assets.

We manufacture substantially all of our products
outside the U.S. and sell a significant portion of our products in non-U.S. markets, subjecting us to various risks relating to international activities that could adversely affect our overall profitability.

Sales outside
North and Latin America accounted for approximately 49%, 51%, and 52% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 50% of our net revenues in the
foreseeable future. Our sales outside of North America and our operations in Europe, Australia and Asia are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in our U.S. operations, including:

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•

tariffs and other trade barriers;

- 42 -

•

compliance with foreign medical device manufacturing regulations;

•

reduction in third party payer reimbursement for our products;

•

inability to obtain import licenses;

•

changes in trade policies and in U.S. and foreign tax policies;

•

possible changes in export or import restrictions; and

•

the modification or introduction of other governmental policies with potentially adverse effects.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and
earnings.

Since our international sales and a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in local currencies and not in U.S. dollars, our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates. We had foreign currency transaction losses in recent periods and may have further losses in the future. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our business and that a significant
portion of our manufacturing costs will continue to be denominated in Australian dollars.

Government and private insurance plans may not reimburse patients for our products, which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products.

Our ability to sell our
products depends in large part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of our products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. These third party payers are
increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Therefore, even if a product is approved for marketing, we cannot assure you that reimbursement will be allowed for the product, that the reimbursement amount will be
adequate or, that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate, will not subsequently be reduced. For example, in some markets, such as Spain, France and Germany, government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our
products but is subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations. In other markets, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleep-disordered breathing
conditions. Additionally, future legislation or regulation concerning the health care industry or third party or governmental coverage and reimbursement, particularly legislation or regulation limiting consumers’ reimbursement rights, may harm
our business.

As we continue to develop new products, those
products will generally not qualify for reimbursement, if at all, until they are approved for marketing. In the United States, we sell our products primarily to home health care dealers and to sleep clinics. We do not file claims and bill
governmental programs and other third party payers directly for reimbursement for our products. However, we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental reimbursement programs, particularly Medicaid and Medicare.

In particular, the federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits persons from knowingly
and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under
a federal health care program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us. Many states and other governments
have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Law. We are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any third party payer. These laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or
executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third party payers. These laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage, coding, and reimbursement of their products to persons
who do bill third party payers. Any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties, including fines.

- 43 -

In addition to reimbursement for our products, our customers depend in part on reimbursement by
government and private health insurers for other products. During fiscal year 2004, the US Government proposed reductions in reimbursement rates for some of these other products. Such proposed reductions, if they occur, may have a material impact on
our customers. Any material impact on our customers may indirectly affect our sales to those customers, or the collectibility of receivables we have from those customers.

Complying with Food and Drug Administration and other regulations is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any
failure to comply could result in substantial penalties.

We are subject to various federal, state, local and international regulations regarding our business activities. Failure to comply with these regulations could
result in, among other things, recalls of our products, substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees. A recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs, damage our reputation, and materially affect operating
results.

Product sales, introductions or modifications may
be delayed or canceled as a result of the FDA or similar foreign regulations, which could cause our sales and profits to decline.

Before we can market or sell a new medical device in the United States, we must obtain FDA
clearance, which can be a lengthy and time-consuming process. We generally receive clearance from the FDA to market our products in the United States under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or our products are exempt
from the 510(k) clearance process. We have modified some of our 510(k) approved products without submitting new 510(k) notices, which we do not believe were required. However, if the FDA disagrees with us and requires us to submit new 510(k)
notifications for modifications to our existing products, we may be required to stop marketing the products while the FDA reviews the 510(k) notification.

Any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier, more rigorous FDA examination process. For example, in
certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510(k) notice. Additionally, we may be required to obtain premarket approvals for our products. The requirements of these more rigorous processes could delay
product introductions and increase the costs associated with FDA compliance. Marketing and sale of our products outside the United States are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals, and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals,
our sales could suffer.

We cannot assure you that any new
products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from U.S. or foreign regulatory agencies.

Off-label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties.

Clearance under Section 510(k) only permits
us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the FDA. We may request additional label indications for our current products, and the FDA may deny those requests outright, require additional expensive clinical data to
support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance. If the FDA determines that we have marketed our products for off-label use, we could be subject to fines, injunctions
or other penalties.

Disruptions in the supply of components
from our single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability.

We purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from various suppliers, including some who are single-source
suppliers for us. We cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or, in the alternative, that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement
part.

- 44 -

A reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components, or while we
reconfigure our devices for the replacement part, would limit our ability to manufacture our devices, which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability. We cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our
production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply.

Our intellectual property may not protect our products, and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties.

We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and non-disclosure
agreements to protect our intellectual property. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain United States and foreign patent protection for our products, their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to
operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. We have a number of pending patent applications, and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications. We do not know whether any of the claims in our
issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable. Legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are
still evolving, and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims. Additionally, there may be third party patents, patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not
known to us and that block or compete with our products.

We
face the risks that:

•

third parties will infringe our intellectual property rights;

•

our non-disclosure agreements will be breached;

•

we will not have adequate remedies for infringement;

•

our trade secrets will become known to or independently developed by our competitors; or

•

third parties will be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or require us to license and pay fees or royalties in order for us to be able to market some of our
products.

Litigation may be necessary to enforce
patents issued to us, to protect our proprietary rights, or to defend third party claims that we have infringed upon proprietary rights of others. The defense and prosecution of patent claims, including these pending claims, as well as participation
in other inter-party proceedings, can be expensive and time consuming, even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us. If the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse, we could be subject to
significant liabilities to third parties, could be required to obtain licenses from third parties or could be required to cease sales of the affected products. Additionally, the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to
country, and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved, or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits.

We are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage,
which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims.

We are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. Any product liability claim brought
against us, with or without merit, could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates. In addition, we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits. Our insurance policies have various exclusions,
and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage, in which case, we may have to pay the entire amount of any award. We cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims
brought against us will be covered by our insurance. Insurance varies in cost and can be difficult to obtain, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. A successful product
liability

- 45 -

claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage, if any, may require us to pay substantial amounts, which could harm our business.

We are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many
jurisdictions.

From time to time we may be audited by the tax authorities and are still subject to an ongoing German tax audit. Any final assessment resulting from this audit could result in material changes to our past or
future taxable income, tax payable or deferred tax assets, and could require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results.

Our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons.

Our
operating results have, from time to time, fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future. These fluctuations may result from a number of factors, including:

•

the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;

•

the geographic mix of product sales;

•

the success of our marketing efforts in new regions;

•

changes in third party reimbursement;

•

timing of regulatory clearances and approvals;

•

timing of orders by distributors;

•

expenditures incurred for research and development;

•

competitive pricing in different regions;

•

seasonality;

•

the cost and effect of promotional and marketing programs;

•

the effect of foreign currency transaction gains or losses; and

•

other activities of our competitors.

If a natural or man-made disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities, we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time
and our sales and profitability will decline.

Our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead-time to repair or replace. The
facilities may be affected by natural or man-made disasters and in the event it was affected by a disaster, we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers. Although we believe we possess adequate insurance for damage to our property and the
disruption of our business from casualties, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.

Delaware law, provisions in our charter and our shareholder rights plan
could make it difficult for another company to acquire us.

Provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or
our security holders. In particular, our board of directors is divided into three classes, serving for staggered three-year terms. Because of this classification it will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors constituting a majority
of our board of directors.

Additionally, our board of
directors has the authority to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders.
Under our stockholder rights plan, we have also issued purchase rights to the holders of our common stock that entitle those holders to purchase our Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a discount, under certain circumstances. The rights
of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be

- 46 -

adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect
of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights
of the holders of our common stock.

You may not be able to
enforce the judgments of U.S. courts against some of our assets or officers and directors.

A substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States. Additionally, two of our eight directors and two of our
six executive officers reside outside the United States, along with all or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments of U.S. courts relating to any liabilities under
U.S. securities laws against our assets, those persons or their assets. In addition, we have been advised by our Australian counsel that some doubt exists as to the ability of investors to pursue claims based on U.S. securities laws against these
assets or these persons in Australian courts.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures.

As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out
an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
June 30, 2005. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting
during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that:

(i)

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

(ii)

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

(iii)

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.

Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

- 48 -

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
of June 30, 2005. Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of ResMed, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial
reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Based on our assessment and those criteria, management has concluded that the Company did maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as
of June 30, 2005.

KPMG LLP, independent registered public
accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of ResMed, Inc. included in this report, has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting.

Scope of Management’s Report

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting excludes the evaluation of the internal controls over financial reporting of Saime, Hoefner and Resprecare, which were acquired purchase business combinations on May 19, 2005, February 8, 2005 and December 14,
2004, respectively. Purchase combinations excluded from fiscal 2005 scope represents approximately 20% of the total assets and approximately 3% of the net sales, respectively, of our consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2005 and the
year ended June 30, 2005.

ResMed Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that ResMed Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). ResMed Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that ResMed Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, is fairly stated,
in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, ResMed Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

ResMed Inc. acquired Saime, Hoefner and Resprecare during
2005, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of ResMed Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, Saime, Hoefner and Resprecare’s internal control over financial reporting
associated with total assets of 20% and total revenues of 3% included in the consolidated financial statements of ResMed Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended June 30, 2005. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of
ResMed Inc. also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Saime, Hoefner and Resprecare.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of ResMed Inc.
and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2005, and
our report dated September 10, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ResMed Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2005, and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2005. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule II. These consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ResMed Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of ResMed Inc.’s internal
control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated September
10, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1)

Organization and Basis of Presentation

ResMed Inc (the “Company”) is a Delaware Corporation formed in March 1994 as a holding company for the ResMed Group. Through our subsidiaries,
we design, manufacture and market devices for the evaluation and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing, primarily obstructive sleep apnea. Our manufacturing operations are located in Australia, Germany, France, and the United States of America.
Major distribution and sales sites are located in the United States of America, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Australia and Sweden.

(2)

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions
and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ from management’s estimates.

(b)

Revenue Recognition

Revenue on product sales is generally recorded upon shipment, at which time title transfers to the customer. Revenue on product sales which require
customer acceptance is not recorded until acceptance is received. Royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded when earned. Service revenue received in advance from service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life
of the service contract. Revenue received in advance from rental unit contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract. Revenue from sale of marketing or distribution rights is initially deferred and
recognized ratably as revenue over the life of the contract. Freight charges billed to customers are included in revenue. All freight-related expenses are charged to cost of sales.

We do not offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products, other than returns for product
defects or other warranty claims, nor do we offer variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities. However, as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders, one time special pricing to support new product
introductions, sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or price-breaks for regular order volumes. The costs of all such programs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue. In our U.S. sales activities we use a number of manufacturer
representatives to sell our products. These representatives are paid a direct commission on sales and act as an integral component of our U.S. sales force. We do not sell our products to these representatives and do not recognize revenue on such
shipments. Our products are predominantly therapy-based equipment and require no installation. As such, we have no significant installation obligations.

(c)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents include certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and other highly liquid investments and are stated at cost, which approximates market.
Investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are considered to be cash equivalents for purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows.

(d)

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined principally by the first-in, first-out method, or net realizable value. We review and provide for any product obsolescence in our manufacturing and distribution
operations with assessments of individual products and components (based on estimated future usage and sales) being performed throughout the year.

(e)

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment, including rental equipment, is recorded at cost. Depreciation expense is computed using the straight–line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to ten years except for buildings, which are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 40 years. Straight–line and accelerated methods of depreciation are used for tax purposes.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.

(f)

Intangible Assets

The registration costs for new patents are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the patent, generally five years. In the event of a
patent being superseded, the unamortized costs are written off immediately.

Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from seven to nine years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into
account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. No impairment of intangible assets have been identified during any of
the periods presented.

(g)

Goodwill

We conducted our annual review for goodwill impairment as at June 30, 2005. In conducting our review of goodwill impairment, we identified reporting units, being components of our operating segment, as each of
the entities acquired and giving rise to the goodwill. The fair value for each reporting unit was determined based on estimated discounted cash flows. Our goodwill impairment review involved a two-step process as follows:

Step 1-

Compare the fair value for each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. For each reporting unit where the carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds the reporting unit’s
fair value, move on to step 2. If a reporting unit’s fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary.

Step 2-

Allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non-goodwill intangible assets and liabilities. This will derive an implied fair value for the goodwill. Then,
compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill,
an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess.

The results of the
review indicated that no impaired goodwill exists.

(h)

Foreign Currency

The consolidated financial statements of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, whose functional currencies are other than U.S. dollars, are translated into U.S.
dollars for financial reporting purposes. Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated at period end exchange rates, and revenue and expense transactions are translated at
average exchange rates for the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are recognized as part of comprehensive income, as described in Note 6, and are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet until such
time as the subsidiary is sold or substantially or completely liquidated. Gains and losses on transactions denominated in other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in operations.

Research and Development

Research and development costs are expensed in the period incurred.

(j)

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, net income is adjusted for the after-tax amount of interest associated with convertible debt, and the denominator includes both the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding and the number of dilutive common stock equivalents such as stock options and convertible notes.

The weighted average shares used to calculate basic earnings per share were 34,322,000, 33,694,000, and 33,054,000 for the years ended June 30, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The difference between basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share is attributable to the impact of outstanding stock options during the periods presented and the assumed conversion of our convertible notes.
Stock options had the effect of increasing the number of shares used in the calculation (by application of the treasury stock method) by 1,280,000, 1,431,000 and 1,385,000 for the years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
conversion of our convertible notes had the effect of increasing the number of shares used in the calculation by 1,869,000, NIL and NIL for the years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Stock options of 284,000, 751,000 and 1,408,000 for the years ended
June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect of exercising these options would have been anti-dilutive.

Basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods ended 30 June
2005, 2004 and 2003 are calculated as follows (in thousands except per share data):

(1)

Diluted earnings per share has been calculated after adjusting the numerator (net income) by
$3,285,000, $NIL and $NIL for the years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively for the effect of assumed conversion of our convertible notes, and the related reduction in interest expense, net of tax.

(k)

Financial Instruments

The carrying value of financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities available-for-sale, accounts receivable and accounts
payable approximate their fair value because of their short-term nature. The estimated fair value of the Company’s convertible subordinated notes, which are included within long-term debt, at June 30, 2005 approximates $129.2 million
compared with the carrying value of $113.3 million. Foreign currency option contracts are marked to market and therefore reflect their fair value. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

The fair value of financial instruments is defined as the amount at which
the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.

(l)

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

We enter into various types of foreign exchange contracts in managing our foreign exchange risk, including derivative financial instruments encompassing
forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options.

The
purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect us from adverse exchange rate fluctuations with respect to net cash movements resulting from the sales of products to foreign customers and Australian manufacturing activities. We
enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated sales and manufacturing costs, principally denominated in Australian dollars and Euros. The terms of such foreign currency option contracts generally do not exceed three years.

Our foreign currency derivatives portfolio represents a cash
flow hedge program against the net cash flow of our international manufacturing operations. We have determined our hedge program to be a non-effective hedge as defined under SFAS 133. The foreign currency derivatives portfolio is recorded in the
consolidated balance sheets at fair value and included in other assets or other liabilities.

All movements in the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives are recorded within other income, net on our consolidated statements of income.

We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counter parties to financial instruments. The
credit exposure of foreign exchange options at June 30, 2005 and June 30, 2004 was $3.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, which represents the positive fair value of options held by us.

We held foreign currency option contracts with notional amounts totaling
$145.5 million and $140.6 million at June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, to hedge foreign currency items. These contracts mature at various dates before July 2007.

(m)

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Marketable Securities

Management determines the appropriate classification of our investments in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such
determination at each balance sheet date. Debt securities for which we do not have the intent or ability to hold to maturity are classified as available-for-sale. Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and
losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive income.

At June 30, 2005 and 2004, the investments in debt securities were classified on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as marketable securities-available-for-sale. These investments are diversified among high credit quality
securities in accordance with our investment policy.

(o)

Warranty

Estimated future warranty costs related to certain products are charged to operations in the period in which the related revenue is recognized. The liability for warranty costs are included in accrued expenses in our
condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Changes in the liability
for product warranty for the year ended June 30, 2005 are as follows (in thousands):

(p)

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used, including certain identifiable intangible assets, when events and
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the
carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

(q)

Cost-Method Investments

The aggregate carrying amount of our cost-method investments at June 30, 2005 and June 30, 2004 was $5.3 million and $5.3 million respectively.
At June 30 2005 we reviewed the carrying value of these investments. In fiscal 2005 and 2004, we recognized $0.1 million and $Nil respectively of impairment losses related to our cost method investments, which include investments in privately
held service companies, research companies and publicly traded companies. After recognition of the impaired loss we have determined that the fair value of the investments exceeded the carrying values and no unrealized losses existed.

Stock-based Employee Compensation

We have granted stock options to personnel, including officers and directors, under both our 1995 Option Plan and our 1997 Equity Participation Plan.
These options have expiration dates of ten years from the date of grant and vest over three or four years. We granted these options with the exercise price equal to the market value as determined at the date of grant.

We apply APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for our equity plans and as
all stock options are issued at market price on the date of issue, no compensation cost has been recognized for the grant of stock options. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation:

Compensation
costs for the options granted for years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $13,340,000 (net of tax $9,792,000), $12,695,000 (net of tax $9,394,000), and $21,696,000 (net of tax $14,102,000), respectively.

Compensation costs for the ESPP purchase rights for June 30, 2005, 2004
and 2003 was $763,000 (net of tax $531,000), $nil and $nil, respectively.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, (“FASB”), issued SFAS 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”, which is a revision
of SFAS 123. Generally, the approach in SFAS 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income
statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative. This statement also eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using APB Opinion No. 25. The statement, which was
delayed, is effective at the beginning of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. Early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued. The accounting provision SFAS 123(R) is effective
beginning in our interim period ending September 30, 2005.

SFAS 123(R) permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods: (1) A “modified prospective” method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the
requirements of SFAS 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees before the effective date of SFAS 123(R) that remain unvested on the
effective date; or (2) A “modified retrospective” method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS
123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either (a) all prior periods presented or (b) prior interim periods of the year of adoption. We expect to adopt the modified prospective method.

As permitted by SFAS 123, we currently account for share-based payments to
employees using Opinion 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options, which are granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of
grant. We are currently reviewing the impact of the adoption of SFAS 123(R) however we expect the adoption of SFAS 123(R) will have a significant impact on our results of operations.

New Accounting Pronouncements, Continued

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, (“FASB”), issued SFAS 153,
“ Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets, an Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, ’Accounting for Non-monetary Transactions’.” The amendments are based on the principle that exchanges of non-monetary assets should be measured based on the
fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS 153 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005, however earlier application is permitted for non-monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after the date of
issuance. The provisions of this statement will be applied prospectively. We do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”), issued SFAS 151, “Inventory Costs”, which sought to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage. SFAS 151 also requires that the allocation of fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal operating capacity of the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not believe the adoption of this statement will
have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Long-term debt, Continued

As at June 30, 2005, we had convertible subordinated notes outstanding of $113.3 million.

The notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, at any
time on or before maturity, into shares of common stock of ResMed Inc. The notes are currently convertible at a conversion price of $60.60 per share, which is equal to a conversion rate of 16.5017 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes,
subject to adjustment.

We may redeem some or all of the notes
at any time on or after June 22, 2005, at a redemption price of 100.8% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded 130% of the
conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day before the date of mailing of the optional redemption notice.

The notes are general unsecured obligations and are subordinated to all of
our existing and future senior indebtedness and will be effectively subordinated to all of the indebtedness and liabilities of our subsidiaries. The indenture governing the notes does not limit us or our subsidiaries from incurring senior
indebtedness or other indebtedness.

Interest is to be paid on
the notes on June 20 and December 20 of each year.

Syndicated Facility

On May 16, 2005, our
wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, ResMed Ltd. entered into a Syndicated Facility Agreement (the “Syndicated Facility Agreement”) with HSBC Bank Australia Limited, as Initial Lender, Facility Agent and Security Trustee, which provides for
a 5 year term loan of EUR 50,000,000 (the “Loan”), the proceeds of which are required to be used solely to fund the obligations of our wholly-owned French subsidiary ResMed SA under its agreement to acquire Saime SA.

The Loan bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR for deposits denominated in
Euro plus a margin of 0.90% or 1.00%, depending on the ratio of the total debt to EBITDA, as defined in the Syndicated Facility Agreement, of ResMed Ltd. and its subsidiaries for the most recently completed fiscal year for the applicable interest
period, and is payable quarterly. The effective interest rate is currently 3.03%. Payments of principal must be made to reduce the total outstanding principal amount of the Loan to EUR 48,250,000 on June 30, 2006, EUR 44,500,000 on
June 30, 2007, EUR 37,750,000 on June 30, 2008, EUR 27,500,000 on June 30, 2009, EUR 15,000,000 on December 31, 2009, and the entire outstanding principal amount must be repaid in full on May 15, 2010. As at June 30,
2005, the facility loan with HSBC had an amount outstanding of $60.4 million.

The Loan is secured by a pledge of one hundred percent of the shares of Saime SA, and a Guarantee by ResMed SA and Take Air Medical Handels GmbH. The Syndicated Facility Agreement also contains customary covenants,
including certain financial covenants and an obligation that ResMed Ltd. maintain certain financial ratios, including a minimum debt service cover ratio, a maximum ratio of total debt to EBITDA and a minimum tangible net worth. The entire principal
amount of the Loan and any accrued but unpaid interest may be declared immediately due and payable in the event of the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the Syndicated Facility Agreement, which include, among other items, failure to
make payments when due, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, the occurrence of certain insolvency events, the occurrence of an event or change which could have a material adverse effect on ResMed Ltd. and its subsidiaries, and if
ResMed Inc. ceases to control ResMed Ltd, ResMed SA, Saime SA or any of Saime SA’s subsidiaries

Restructuring expenses incurred during the year ended June 30, 2005 were $5.3 million ($3.2 million net of tax). Restructuring expenses
(predominantly one-time employee termination benefits) are associated with the integration of the separate operations of ResMed Germany and MAP into a single operating unit. We have substantially completed the relocation of our ResMed Germany
operation (previously located in Moenchengladbach) to Munich and integration of the back office functions including customer service, logistics and administration. We will continue to monitor the progress of this restructure and adjust our business
strategies and personnel accordingly to achieve maximum efficiencies and cost savings.

Following is a summary of the restructuring liabilities related to the restructure and integration of the separate operations of ResMed Germany and MAP into a single operating unit, that were recorded during the year
ended June 30, 2005 (in thousands):

Stockholders’ Equity, Continued

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”).

The ESPP was
approved by our shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in November 2003. Under the ESPP, participants are offered the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount during successive offering periods. Each offering period under the
ESPP will be for a period of time determined by the Board of Directors’ Compensation Committee of no less than 3 months and no more than 27 months. The purchase price for our common stock under the ESPP will be the lower of 85% of the fair
market value of our common stock on the date of grant or 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of purchase. An individual participant cannot subscribe for more than $25,000 in common stock during any calendar year. There is a
maximum of 3,250,000 shares of our common stock authorized for sale under the ESPP.

During fiscal year 2005, the company issued 66,735 shares in two offerings at an average share price of $39.70 to our employees.

Preferred Stock.

In April 1997, the board of directors authorized 2,000,000 shares of $0.01 par value preferred stock. No
such shares were issued or outstanding at June 30, 2005.

Stock Purchase Rights.

In April 1997, the Company implemented a plan to protect stockholders’ rights in the event of a proposed takeover of the Company. Under the plan, each share of the Company’s
outstanding common stock carries one right to purchase Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the “Right”). The Right enables the holder, under certain circumstances, to purchase common stock of the Company or of the acquiring
person at a substantially discounted price ten days after a person or group publicly announces it has acquired or has tendered an offer for 20% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The Rights are redeemable at $0.01 per Right and
expire in 2007.

Common
Stock.

On June 6, 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 4.0 million shares of outstanding common stock. During fiscal year 2005 and 2004, the Company repurchased 241,000 and
471,000 shares at a cost of $11.0 million and $19.0 million respectively. As of June 30, 2005, we have repurchased a total of 1,127,459 shares at a cost of $41.4 million. Shares that are repurchased are classified as treasury stock pending
future use and reduce the number of shares outstanding used in calculating earnings per share.

Stock Split.

On August 10, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split of our Common Stock to be payable in the form of a 100% stock dividend. Shareholders will receive
one additional share of Common Stock for every share held on September 15, 2005. No amounts in these financial statements have been adjusted for this stock split.

The valuation allowance at June 30, 2005, relates primarily to a provision for uncertainty as to
the utilization of foreign tax credits of $8,422,000 and net operating loss carryforwards of $482,000 for certain non-US countries. We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefits of deferred tax assets, net of any valuation allowance,
will be realized.

The Company has not provided U.S. income
taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries. The total amount of these undistributed earnings at June 30, 2005 amounted to approximately $251,030,000. Should the Company repatriate foreign earnings, the Company would
have to adjust the income tax provision in the period management determined that the Company would repatriate earnings. Under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 enacted on October 22, 2004, a one-time favorable foreign dividend provision
would be available to the Company for certain earnings repatriated during its fiscal year ending June 30, 2006. The Company may decide to repatriate earnings under this provision and will complete an evaluation of this opportunity before
June 30, 2006. The effects of any decision cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

(15)

Employee Retirement Plans

The Company contributes to a number of employee retirement plans for the benefit of its employees. These plans are detailed as follows:

(1) Australia - The Company contributes to defined contribution pension plans
for each employee resident in Australia. All Australian employees after serving a qualifying period, are entitled to benefits on retirement, disability or death. Employees may contribute additional funds to the plans. The Company contributes to the
plans at the rate of 9% of the salaries of all Australian employees. Total Company contributions to the plans for the years ended June 30, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $2,612,000, $2,410,000 and $1,663,391, respectively.

(2) United Kingdom - The Company contributes to a defined contribution plan
for each permanent United Kingdom employee. All employees, after serving a three-month qualifying period, are entitled to benefit on retirement, disability or death. Employees may contribute additional funds to the plan. The Company contributes to
the plans at the rate of 5% of the salaries of all United Kingdom employees. Total Company contributions to the plan were $67,000, $33,000 and $23,000 in fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003 respectively.

(3) United States - The Company sponsors a defined contribution pension plan
available to substantially all domestic employees. Company contributions to this plan are based on a percentage of employee contributions to a maximum of 3% of the employee’s salary. Total Company contributions to the plan were $514,000,
$362,000 and $326,000 in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively.

(4) Switzerland - The Company sponsors a fixed return defined contribution fund for each permanent Swiss employee. As part of the Company’s contribution to the fund the company guarantees a fixed 3% net return on accumulated
contributions per annum. The Company contributes to the plans at variable rates that have averaged 10% of salaries over the last three years. Total Company contributions to the plan were $85,000, $139,000 and $133,000 in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003
respectively.

Business Acquisitions

Fiscal year ended June 30, 2005

Saime SA (“Saime”).

On May 19, 2005 we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Financiere ACE SAS, the
holding company for Saime SA and its affiliates, for net cash consideration of $40.5 million. This was comprised of $51.0 million in consideration, including acquisition costs, less $10.5 million of cash acquired. Additionally, as part of the
acquisition we assumed (and immediately repaid) debt of $65.8 million. The acquisition and the immediate repayment of the assumed debt was funded with cash on hand and a five-year secured loan of 50 million Euro, equivalent to $62.7 million,
from HSBC Bank Australia Limited (note 10).

Saime is a leading
developer of ventilation products and distributes its products directly in France and Germany and through a network of distributors in Europe and Asia-Pacific.

The acquisition has been accounted for using purchase accounting and has been included within our consolidated financial statements from May, 19, 2005.
The company has not yet completed the purchase price allocation as the appraisals associated with the valuation of certain tangible assets are not yet complete. The company does not believe that the appraisals will materially modify the preliminary
purchase price allocation. We expect to complete our purchase price allocation in the six months ended December 31, 2005.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed from Saime at the date of acquisition based on an independent appraisal and internal studies (in thousands):

Since its
formation in 1987, Saime has developed a complete range of ventilators for use in the home and hospital markets. Saime distributes its products directly in France and Germany and through a network of distributors in Europe and Asia Pacific. Saime
develops, manufactures and markets products from its headquarters near Paris, with a staff of approximately 100.

The company believes that the Saime acquisition resulted in the recognition of goodwill primarily because of its industry position and management
strength. In addition, Saime’s products complete our line of homecare ventilation products and will immediately expand our market presence and distribution network in Europe and other regions. The Saime devices will complement our VPAPIII and
Autoset CS devices and will allow us to provide the full range of options for patients who need ventilatory assistance.

Hoefner Medizintechnick GmbH (“Hoefner”).

On February 14, 2005 we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of
Hoefner Medizintechnick GmbH (“Hoefner”), for net cash consideration of $8.2 million. This was comprised of the $10.7 million in total consideration, including acquisition costs, less $2.5 million of cash acquired. Under the purchase
agreement, we may also be required to make additional future payments of up to $0.9 million based on the achievement of certain performance milestones following the acquisition through December 31, 2006. Hoefner is a German-based company that
distributes medical equipment and associated services for the treatment of sleep and respiratory patients. Hoefner was our Bavarian distributor before the acquisition, and the acquisition is consistent with our strategy for ongoing expansion of our
international operations. We have been particularly successful in selling directly in Europe, which improves our understanding of local markets as well as our relationships with physicians and payers. The acquisition also brings us into closer
contact with patients and allows us to more directly respond to their needs.

Business Acquisitions, Continued

The acquisition has been accounted for using purchase accounting and has been included within our
consolidated financial statements from February 14, 2005. An amount of $8.2 million, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired of $2.5 million, has been recorded as goodwill.

The cost of the acquisition was allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The fair values were determined by an independent appraisal and internal studies. The following table summarizes the final purchase price
allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Hoefner at the date of acquisition (in thousands):

Resprecare
BV.

On December 1, 2004 we acquired substantially all the assets of Resprecare BV, our Dutch distributor, for initial consideration of $5.9 million in cash, including acquisition costs. The acquisition of the
exclusive Dutch distributor for our Resmed-branded products is consistent with our strategy for ongoing expansion of our international operations. Under the purchase agreement, we potentially were also required to make up to $1.4 million of
additional future payments based on the achievement of certain milestones. Of these potential additional payments, $0.6 million was paid in January 2005 as a result of the successful achievement of a performance milestone and a further $0.7 million
was accrued as additional consideration at June 30, 2005 as a result of the integration of the Dutch subsidiary of our subsidiary MAP with the newly-acquired Resprecare business. The decision to integrate these operations determined the amount
of the final future payment, which will be paid in January 2006.

The acquisition has been accounted for using purchase accounting and accordingly, the results of operations of Resprecare have been included within our consolidated financial statements from December 1, 2004. An amount of $4.4 million,
representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired of $2.8 million, has been recorded as goodwill, which will be tax deductible under Dutch Law. An independent third party has completed a valuation
of identifiable intangible assets associated with the Resprecare acquisition. As a result of this valuation, $1.7 million that was preliminarily allocated to goodwill has been recorded as a customer relationship intangible asset and is being
amortized over its estimated useful life of seven years.

Legal Actions and Contingencies

In the normal course of business, we are subject to routine litigation incidental to our business. While the results of this litigation cannot be

Legal Actions and Contingencies, Continued

During September and October 2004, the Company received tax assessment notices for the audit of one
of its German subsidiaries by the German tax authorities for the years 1996 through 1998. Certain of these adjustments are being contested and appealed to the German tax authority office. We believe no additional provision is necessary for any tax
adjustment that may result from the tax audit. However, the outcome of the audit cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any tax audit issues be resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the Company could be
required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period of resolution.

On December 23, 2002 three former contractors of our subsidiary MAP Medizin-Technologie GmbH initiated proceedings in Munich 1 Regional Court (Proceedings No. 7 O 23286/02), petitioning the Court for a
declaration of inventorship with respect to MAP German Patent Applications identified as No. 100 31 079 and 101 92 802.5 and European Patent Application No. EP 01 967 819.7. On March 10, 2005 the Court entered judgment in favor of the
plaintiffs, finding that they should be identified as co-inventors in place of certain individual defendants. In April 2005, MAP filed an appeal of that decision. We do not expect the outcome of this litigation to have an adverse material effect on
our consolidated financial statements.

(20)

In-Process Research and Development Charge (“IPR&D”)

On acquisition of Saime in May 2005, we recognized as an expense a charge of $5.3 million with respect to IPR&D programs under active development by
Saime that, at date of acquisition, had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The estimated fair value assigned to IPR&D was based on an independent appraisal and was comprised of the following projects (in
thousands):

The value of
IPR&D was calculated by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established, estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products, estimating the
resulting net cash flows from such products, discounting the net cash flows to present value, and applying the reduced percentage completion of the projects thereto. The discount rate used in the analysis was 25%, which was based on the risk profile
of the acquired assets.

As of the date of acquisition, these
projects have estimated costs to complete totaling approximately $1.1 million. The projects were in various stages of development but are expected to reach completion at various dates ranging from 1 to 3 years.

We believe that the assumptions used to value the acquired intangible assets
were reasonable at the time of acquisition. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project revenues, development costs or profitability, or events associated with such projects, will transpire
as estimated. For these reasons, among others, actual results may vary from the projected results.

Subsequent Events

On July 1, 2005 we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Pulmomed Medizinisch-technische Geräte GmbH (“Pulmomed), for cash
consideration of $1.5 million. Under the purchase agreement we may also be

required to make additional future payments of up to $0.9 million based on the achievement of certain performance milestones following the acquisition
through July 15, 2007. Pulmomed is an Austrian based company that distributes medical equipment and associated services for the treatment of sleep and respiratory patients.

On July 7, 2005, we purchased a 9.78-acre parcel of land in San Diego for $21.0 million. The new location at Kearney
Mesa, San Diego will allow us to develop our new corporate headquarters. We expect to commence building during calendar year 2006 and begin moving into the facility in calendar 2007.

On August 10, 2005 we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a two-for-one split of its common stock,
payable in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend. Shareholders of record will receive one additional share of common stock for every share held on September 15, 2005.
