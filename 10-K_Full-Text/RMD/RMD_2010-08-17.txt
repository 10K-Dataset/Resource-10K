General

We are a leading developer, manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating, diagnosing, and managing sleep-disordered
breathing and other respiratory disorders. Sleep-disordered breathing, or SDB, includes obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA, and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep. When we were formed in 1989, our primary purpose was to commercialize a
treatment for OSA developed by Professor Colin Sullivan. This treatment, nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, or CPAP, was the first successful noninvasive treatment for OSA. CPAP systems deliver pressurized air, typically through a nasal
mask, to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep.

Since the development of CPAP, we have developed a number of innovative products for SDB and other respiratory disorders including airflow
generators, diagnostic products, mask systems, headgear and other accessories. Our growth has been fuelled by geographic expansion, increased awareness of respiratory conditions as a significant health concern among physicians and patients, and our
research and product development efforts.

We
employ approximately 3,200 people and sell our products in over 70 countries through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors.

Corporate
History

ResMed Inc., a Delaware corporation,
was formed in March 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our Americas, Asia-Pacific and European operating subsidiaries. On June 1, 1995, we completed an initial public offering of common stock and on June 2, 1995 our common stock
commenced trading on the NASDAQ National Market. On September 30, 1999 we transferred our principal public listing to the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, trading under the ticker symbol RMD. On November 25, 1999, we established a
secondary listing of our common stock via Chess Depositary Instruments, or CDI’s, on the Australian Stock Exchange (now known as the Australian Securities Exchange), or ASX, also under the symbol RMD. Ten CDI’s on the ASX represent one
share of our common stock on the NYSE. On July 1, 2002, we converted our ASX listing status from a foreign exempt listing to a full listing.

Our Australian subsidiary, ResMed Holdings Limited, was originally organized in 1989 by Dr. Peter Farrell to acquire from Baxter
Center for Medical Research Pty Limited, or Baxter, the rights to certain technology relating to CPAP treatment as well as Baxter’s existing CPAP device business. Baxter had sold CPAP devices in Australia since 1988, having acquired the rights
to the technology in 1987.

Since formation we
have acquired a number of operating businesses including:

On October 1,
2009 we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Laboratoires Narval SA. Based in France, Laboratoires Narval manufactures and distributes a mandibular repositioning device (“MRD”) that offers a solution to patients for snoring and
obstructive sleep apnea (“OSA”), especially for those with mild OSA. With this acquisition, we add another therapy to supplement our existing positive airway pressure-based solutions, providing a broader offering for this patient group.

Segment Information

We believe that, given the single market focus of our
operations solely in the sleep-disordered breathing sector of the respiratory medicine industry, and the inter-dependence of its products, we operate as a single operating segment. See Note 16 – Segment Information of the Notes to
Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for financial information regarding segment reporting. Financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to our consolidated financial
statements.

The Market

Sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two
distinct states: rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep and non-rapid eye movement, or non-REM, sleep. REM sleep, which is about 20-25% of total sleep experienced by adults, is characterized by a high level of brain activity, bursts of rapid eye
movement, increased heart and respiration rates, and paralysis of many muscles. Non-REM sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth; stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest.

The upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by
active contraction of upper airway muscles. Normally, during REM sleep and deeper levels of non-REM sleep, upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows. Individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses
of the upper airway during sleep, called apneas, and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas. These breathing irregularities result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration, causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of
oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond. Typically, the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep, causing the throat muscles to contract, opening the airway. After a few gasping breaths, blood oxygen levels increase
and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself. Sufferers of OSA typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour. While these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep, the individual is not normally aware of
these disruptions. In addition, OSA has recently been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant co-morbidity for heart disease, stroke and diabetes.

Scientists estimate that one in five adults have some form of
obstructive sleep apnea. In the United States alone, this represents approximately 40 million people. Despite the high prevalence of OSA, there is a general lack of awareness of OSA among both the medical community and the general public. It is
estimated that less than 10% of those with OSA have been diagnosed or treated. Many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose OSA because they are unaware that such non-specific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring,
hypertension and irritability are characteristic of OSA.

While OSA has been diagnosed in a broad cross-section of the population, it is predominant among middle-aged men and those who are obese,
smoke, consume alcohol in excess or use muscle-relaxing and pain-killing drugs. A strong association has been discovered between OSA and a number of cardiovascular diseases. Studies have shown that SDB is present in approximately 80% of patients
with drug-resistant hypertension, approximately 72% of patients with type 2 diabetes and approximately 80% of patients with congestive heart failure. In relation to diabetes, recent studies indicate that SDB is independently associated with glucose
intolerance and insulin resistance.

Sleep-Disordered Breathing and Obstructive Sleep Apnea

Sleep-disordered breathing encompasses all physiological
processes that cause detrimental breathing patterns during sleep. Manifestations include OSA, central sleep apnea, or CSA, and hypoventilation

- 4 -


syndromes that occur during sleep. Hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity, chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease. OSA is the most common form of SDB.

Sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper
levels of sleep caused by OSA can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness, reduced cognitive function, including memory loss and lack of concentration, depression and irritability. OSA sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an
elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas. Several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation, increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by OSA may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality due to angina, stroke and heart attack. Patients with OSA have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving, response speed and visual motor coordination, and studies have
linked OSA to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents.

Generally, an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of OSA is referred by a general practitioner to a specialist for further
evaluation. The diagnosis of OSA typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home. During overnight testing, respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored, along with other vital
signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels. Simpler tests, using devices such as our Apnealink, or our automatic positive airway pressure devices, monitor airflow during sleep, and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns. These tests
allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas, hypopneas or subconscious awakenings. We estimate that there are currently around 3,000 sleep clinics in the United States, a substantial portion of which are affiliated with
hospitals. The number of sleep clinics has expanded significantly from approximately 100 such facilities in 1985.

Existing Therapies

Before 1981, the primary treatment for OSA was a tracheotomy, a surgical procedure to cut a hole in the patient’s windpipe to create
a channel for airflow. Most recently, alternative treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, or UPPP, in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway, implanting a
device to add support to the soft palate, or mandibular advancement, in which the lower jaw is moved forward to widen the patient’s airway. UPPP alone has a poor success rate; however, when performed in conjunction with multi-stage upper airway
surgical procedures, a greater success rate has been claimed. These combined procedures, performed by highly specialized surgeons, are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods.

CPAP, by contrast, is a non-invasive means of treating OSA.
CPAP was first used as a treatment for OSA in 1980 by Dr. Colin Sullivan, the past Chairman of our Medical Advisory Board. CPAP systems were commercialized for treatment of OSA in the United States in the mid 1980’s. Today, use of CPAP is
generally acknowledged as the most effective and least invasive therapy for managing OSA.

During CPAP treatment, a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable airflow generator that delivers room air at a
positive pressure. The patient breathes in air from the flow generator and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface. Continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and
unobstructed. Interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows. Sometimes, when a patient leaks air through their mouth, a full-face mask may need to be used, rather than a nasal interface.

CPAP is not a cure and therefore, must be used on a nightly
basis as long as treatment is required. Patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of CPAP treatment. Early generations of CPAP units provided limited patient comfort and convenience. Patients experienced soreness from the

- 5 -


repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the CPAP device operating at the prescribed pressure. In more recent years, product innovations to improve patient comfort and
compliance have been developed. These include more comfortable patient interface systems; delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily; bilevel air flow generators, including Variable Positive Airway
Pressure, or VPAP systems, which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation; heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable; and autotitration devices that reduce the average pressure delivered during the
night.

Business Strategy

We believe that the SDB market will continue to grow in the
future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of OSA, improved understanding of the role of SDB treatment in the management of cardiac, neurologic, metabolic and related disorders, and an increase in home-based diagnosis. Our
strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the SDB market consists of the following key elements:

Continue Product Development and Innovation.

We are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products
for the diagnosis and treatment of SDB. We have been a leading innovator of products designed to more effectively treat SDB, increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy. For example, in 1999 we introduced the Mirage
Full Face Mask. This mask conforms to the patient’s facial contours, creating a more comfortable and better seal. In 2005, we introduced the S8 range of CPAP, a small flow generator with optional integrated humidification. In 2007, we
introduced the Mirage Quattro, a full face mask that offers dual-wall cushion with spring air technology which accommodates movement during sleep, and the Mirage Liberty, which combines our nasal pillow technology in a full face mask product with a
minimalist design. In 2008, we launched several new patient interfaces including the Mirage Micro, a new generation nasal mask with a microfit dial and the Swift LT which offers a pillow system for additional support and comfort. In 2008, we also
launched an updated version of our S8 flow generator and the VPAP Auto, a new bi-level device incorporating our new motor technology including the easy-breathe waveform. In 2009, we launched Activa LT and the Swift LT for Her, which was the first
nasal pillow product released that is designed and marketed specifically for female patients. In 2010, we launched the ApneaLink™ Plus, our type 3 device for home sleep testing, the Swift™ FX mask, the Mirage™ SoftGel mask and the S9
AutoSet and Elite range of flow generator products. We believe that continued product development and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success. Approximately 11% of our employees are devoted to research and development activities. In fiscal
year 2010, we invested $75.2 million, or 7% of our revenues, in research and development.

Expand Geographic Presence.

We market our products in over 70 countries to sleep clinics, home healthcare
dealers and third party payers. We intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal markets, as well as expand the depth of our presence in other geographic regions.

Increase Public and Clinical
Awareness.

We intend to continue to expand our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of SDB and our treatment alternatives. These promotional activities target the population with predisposition to SDB as
well as specialists, such as cardiologists, neurologists and pulmonologists. In addition, we also target special interest groups, including the National Stroke Association, the American Heart Association and the National Sleep Foundation. In concert
with another industry participant we are sponsoring educational programs targeted at the primary care physician community, which should further enlighten both doctors and patients about the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing/obstructive
sleep apnea and co-morbidities such as cardiac disease, diabetes, hypertension and obesity. The programs should also support our efforts to inform the community of the dangers of sleep apnea with regard to occupational health and safety, especially
in the transport industry.

- 6 -


During fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, we donated $3.0 million, $3.5 million and $2.0
million, respectively, to the ResMed Foundation in the United States, and the ResMed Foundation in Australia, to further enhance research and awareness of SDB. The contributions to the Foundations reflect ResMed’s commitment to medical research
into sleep-disordered breathing, particularly the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.

Expand into New Clinical Applications.

We continually seek to identify new applications of our technology
for significant unmet medical needs. Studies have established a clinical association between OSA and both stroke and congestive heart failure, and have recognized SDB as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure. Research also indicates that
SDB is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. We have developed a device for the treatment of Cheyne-Stokes breathing in patients with congestive heart failure. In addition, we maintain close working relationships
with a number of prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology. In 2007, we received Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, clearance and launched a new product in the United States for the treatment of
respiratory insufficiency due to central sleep apnea, mixed apnea and periodic breathing, called the Adapt SV. The Adapt SV uses a technology known as adaptive servo-ventilation and was first made available to a select group of U.S. key opinion
leader sites beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006. Adapt SV utilizes an advanced algorithm to calculate a patient-specific minute ventilation target and automatically adjusts pressure support to maintain the target. We believe this
technology has allowed physicians to successfully treat complex breathing disorders in some patients who had previously tried and failed traditional positive airway pressure therapy.

Leverage the Experience of our Management
Team.

Our senior management team has extensive experience in the medical device industry in general, and in the field of SDB in particular. We intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these
individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused by SDB.

Products

Our portfolio of products for the treatment of OSA and other forms of SDB includes airflow generators, diagnostic products, mask systems,
headgear and other accessories.

Air Flow
Generators

We produce CPAP, VPAP and AutoSet
systems for the titration and treatment of SDB. The flow generator systems deliver positive airway pressure through a patient interface, either a small nasal mask, nasal pillows system, or full-face mask.

Our VPAP units deliver ultra-quiet, comfortable bilevel
therapy. There are two preset pressures: a higher pressure as the patient breathes in, and a lower pressure as the patient breathes out. Breathing out against a lower pressure makes treatment more comfortable, particularly for patients who need high
pressure levels or for those with impaired breathing ability.

AutoSet systems are based on a proprietary technology to monitor breathing and can also be used in the diagnosis, treatment and management
of OSA. CPAP and VPAP flow generators together accounted for approximately 58%, 58% and 50% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

With the acquisition of ResMed Paris SAS, previously Saime
SA, in May 2005, we increased our presence in the European homecare ventilation market. The VS and Elisée range of products are

- 7 -


sophisticated, yet easy to use for physicians, clinicians and patients. We believe these devices compliment our VPAP III, VPAP Adapt SV and Autoset CS2 for patients who need ventilatory
assistance.

Masks, Accessories, Motors and Diagnostic Products

Masks, accessories, motors and diagnostic products together
accounted for approximately 42%, 42% and 50% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Mask Systems and Diagnostic Products

Mask systems are one of the most important elements of SDB treatment systems. Masks are a primary determinant of patient comfort and as
such may drive or impede patient compliance with therapy. We have been a consistent innovator in masks, improving patient comfort while minimizing size and weight.

- 11 -


We market sleep recorders for the diagnosis and titration of SDB in sleep clinics and
hospitals. These diagnostic systems record relevant respiratory and sleep data, which can be analyzed by a sleep specialist or physician who can then tailor an appropriate OSA treatment regimen for the patient.

Accessories and Other Products

To assist those professionals diagnosing or managing the
treatment of patients there are data communications and control products such as the ResLink, ResControl, ResControl II, TxControl, ResScan and ResTraxx modules that facilitate the transfer of data and other information to and from the flow
generators. To enhance patient comfort, convenience and compliance, we market a variety of other products and accessories. These products include humidifiers, such as the HumidAire, H2i and H3i, which connect directly with the CPAP, VPAP and AutoSet
flow generators to humidify and heat the air delivered to the patient. Their use helps prevent the drying of nasal passages that can cause discomfort. Other optional accessories include cold passover humidifiers, carry bags and breathing circuits.

- 12 -


Product Development and Clinical Trials

We have a strong track record in innovation in the sleep
market. In 1989, we introduced our first CPAP device. Since then we have been committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development. Currently, our product development efforts are focused on not only improving our current product
offerings, but also expanding into new product applications.

In 1999, we introduced the AutoSet T flow generator, an autotitrating device that adapts to the patient’s breathing patterns to
effectively prevent apneas. In 2001, we introduced our next generation autotitrating device, the AutoSet Spirit. The AutoSet Spirit is an autotitrating modular device with optional integrated humidifier. In 2003, we introduced the Activa nasal mask
using our patented Active Cushion Technology. In 2004, we launched our Mirage Swift mask, a light and unobtrusive nasal pillows mask system. Also, in 2004 we launched an improved AutoSet CS 2 (outside the United States only) to treat congestive
heart failure patients with significant central sleep apnea. In 2006, we launched the Adapt SV within the United States. This product is for the treatment of respiratory insufficiency due to central sleep apnea, mixed apnea and periodic breathing
and uses a technology which we call adaptive servo-ventilation.

We continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs. SDB is associated with a number of
symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness and irritability. Recent studies have established a clinical association between SDB and hypertension, stroke, congestive heart failure and diabetes. We support clinical trials in the United States,
Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Switzerland and Australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology.

We consult with physicians at major sleep centers throughout the world to identify technological trends in the treatment of SDB. New
product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff, direct sales force, network of distributors, manufacturers’ representatives, customers and patients. Typically, our internal development staff then develops these ideas, where
appropriate, into new products.

In fiscal years
2010, 2009 and 2008 we invested $75.2 million, $63.1 million and $60.5 million, respectively, on research and development.

- 13 -


Sales and Marketing

We currently market our products in over 70 countries using
a network of distributors, independent manufacturers’ representatives and our direct sales force. We attempt to tailor our marketing approach to each national market, based on regional awareness of SDB as a health problem, physician referral
patterns, consumer preferences and local reimbursement policies. See Note 16 – Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for financial information about our geographic areas.

North America and Latin
America.

Our products are typically purchased by a home healthcare dealer who then sells the products to the patient. The decision to purchase our products, as opposed to those of our competitors, is made or influenced by
one or more of the following individuals or organizations: the prescribing physician and his or her staff; the home healthcare dealer; the insurer and the patient. In the United States, our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a
field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives, program development specialists and regional sales directors. Our U.S. field sales organization markets and sells products to home healthcare dealer branch locations throughout
the United States.

We also market our products
directly to sleep clinics. Patients who are diagnosed with OSA and prescribed CPAP treatment are typically referred by the diagnosing sleep clinic to a home healthcare dealer to fill the prescription. The home healthcare dealer, in consultation with
the referring physician, will assist the patient in selecting the equipment, fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the flow generator pressure to the prescribed level.

Sales in North and Latin America accounted for 54%, 54% and
49% of our net revenues for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Europe.

We market our products in most major European countries. We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in
Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We use independent distributors to sell our products in other areas of Europe. Distributors are selected in each country based on their
knowledge of respiratory medicine and a commitment to SDB therapy. In each country in which we sell our products direct, a local senior manager is responsible for direct national sales. In many countries in Europe, we sell our products to home
healthcare dealers who then sell the products to the patients. In Germany, we also operate a home healthcare company, in which we provide products and services directly to patients, and receive reimbursement directly from third party payers.

Sales in Europe accounted for 37%, 38% and 43% of
our total net revenues for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Asia Pacific.

We have wholly–owned subsidiaries in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, China and
India. We use a combination of our direct sales force and independent distributors to sell our products in Asia Pacific. Sales in Asia Pacific and the rest of the world accounted for 9%, 8% and 8% of our total net revenues for the fiscal years 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively.

Other Marketing
Efforts.

We continue to pursue other suitable opportunities with professional and healthcare associations to raise awareness of the co-morbidity of SDB in cardiovascular disease patients, including coronary artery disease,
congestive heart failure, hypertension and stroke. We also continue to work to raise awareness of SDB in diabetes. Current research is increasingly showing an independent association between OSA and type 2 diabetes. Accordingly, we initiated a study
investigating the prevalence of OSA in the type 2 diabetic population. Due to the high prevalence of the SDB and type 2 diabetes, we are now actively supporting the American Association of Diabetes Educators and are in the process of setting up
further initiatives to develop the SDB market in the

- 14 -


diabetic population. ResMed is also reaching out to diabetes patients. Through our partnership with the American Diabetes Association, a sleep laboratory is now present at every

Diabetes
Expo

meeting where patients have the opportunity to learn about diabetes self-management.

In June 2008, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) released a statement on SDB and type 2 diabetes. The IDF Taskforce on
Epidemiology and Prevention strongly recommended that health professionals working in both type 2 diabetes and SDB adopt clinical practices to ensure that a patient presenting with one condition is considered for the other. Furthermore, the IDF
recommended that people with type 2 diabetes should be screened for OSA particularly when they present classical symptoms such as witnessed apneas, heavy snoring or daytime sleepiness and poor workplace performance.

In September 2008, the European Society of Cardiologists
published guidelines for the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure. The guidelines noted that patients with symptomatic heart failure frequently have sleep-related disorders (central or obstructive sleep apnea) and recommended treatment with
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, or CPAP, for patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. We believe that the increasing awareness among the co-morbidity specialists supports the efforts and investment we are making in new markets,
including diabetes and cardiology.

Manufacturing

Our principal manufacturing facility is located in Sydney, Australia and comprises a 155,000 square foot manufacturing facility. Our
manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly and testing of our flow generators, masks and accessories. Of the numerous raw materials, parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products,
most are off-the-shelf items available from multiple vendors. We generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received. Over the last few years, the manufacturing processes have been transformed along lean manufacturing
guidelines to flow lines staffed by dedicated teams. Each team is responsible for the manufacture and quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures, including customer feedback.

We have a 32,000 square foot manufacturing facility in
Singapore to complement the Sydney manufacturing site. The plant commenced with the assembly of masks but now has a flow generator assembly line and an electric motor assembly line.

We have a 43,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Paris,
France. This facility is accredited to ISO 13485 and is primarily responsible for the assembly of mechanical ventilators and associated accessories.

We also manufacture high-quality electric motors for our flow generator devices at the ResMed Motor Technologies Inc. facility which
comprises a 72,000 square foot facility at Chatsworth, California.

Our quality management system is based upon the requirements of ISO 9001, ISO 13485, FDA Quality System Regulations for Medical Devices
and the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC). Our Sydney, Australia and San Diego, California and Singapore facilities are each accredited to ISO 9001 and ISO 13485. These three sites have third party audits conducted by the ISO certification bodies
at regular intervals.

Legislation Affecting
Reimbursement, Taxes

The cost of medical
care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs. In Germany, we receive payments directly from these

- 15 -


payers. Outside Germany, although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payers, our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of patients to
obtain adequate reimbursement for our products.

In the United States, our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers, hospitals or sleep clinics, which then invoice
third-party payers directly for reimbursement. Domestic third-party payers include Medicare, Medicaid and corporate health insurance plans. These payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with
cost-effective treatment methods, or is experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. The long-term trend towards managed healthcare, or legislative proposals to reform healthcare, could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare
services and products and could result in lower prices for our products. In some foreign markets, such as Spain, France and Germany, government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products, however, subject to
constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations. In Australia and in some other foreign markets, there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat OSA.

Recent United States legislation contains provisions that
negatively impact reimbursement to our customers for their sale or rental of products that we provide. These laws, each of which has been signed into law, include the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and
Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the PPACA), Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, (MIPPA) Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA), and the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of
2003 (MMA).

The MMA reduced payment amounts for
five categories of covered home medical equipment items beginning in 2005, froze payment amounts for certain items through 2007, established a competitive acquisition program and implemented quality standards and accreditation requirements for HME
suppliers.

The DRA capped the Medicare rental
period for certain capped rental items, including CPAP devices, at 13 months of continuous use, after which time title of the equipment would transfer to the beneficiary.

MIPPA retroactively delayed the implementation of competitive bidding for eighteen months and decreased the 2009 fee schedule
payment amounts by 9.5 percent for product categories included in competitive bidding. Because the annual update factor for 2010 was 0 percent, the 2009 fee schedule payment rates remain effective for 2010.

The PPACA, among other things, imposes a deductible excise
tax equal to 2.3 percent of the price for which medical devices are sold in the United States on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices, with limited exceptions, beginning in 2013; new face to face encounter requirements for durable
medical equipment and home health services; and a requirement that by 2016, the competitive bidding process must be nationalized or prices in non-competitive bidding areas must be adjusted to match competitive bidding prices.

We cannot predict the impact that any federal legislation
enacted in the future will have on our revenues, profit margins, profitability, operating cash flows and results of operations. While our product line in the United States does not include oxygen and oxygen related equipment, reductions in
reimbursement levels for oxygen could indirectly impact us.

Even though we do not submit claims or bill governmental programs and other third-party payers directly for reimbursement for our products
sold in the United States, we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental programs, and any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties, including fines. In particular, the federal
Anti-Kickback Law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing

- 16 -


remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a
Federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us. Many states have adopted laws similar to
the federal Anti-Kickback Law. We are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any third-party payer. These laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud
any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. These laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage, coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who bill third-party payers. We
continuously strive to comply with these laws and believe that our arrangements do not violate these laws. Liability may still arise from the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business or from a different governmental agency
interpretation of the laws.

Service and
Warranty

We generally offer one-year and
two-year limited warranties on our flow generator products. Warranties on mask systems are for 90 days. In most markets, we rely on our distributors to repair our products with parts supplied by us. In the United States, home healthcare dealers
generally arrange shipment of products to our San Diego facility for repair.

We receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons. We believe that the level of returns experienced to date is
consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices. We provide for warranties and returns based on historical data.

Competition

The markets for our products are highly competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product
features, reliability and price. Customer support, reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors.

We compete on a market-by-market basis with various companies, some of which have greater financial, research, manufacturing and marketing
resources than us. In the United States, our principal market, Philips BV, who acquired Respironics Inc., a previous competitor; DeVilbiss, a division of Sunrise Medical Inc.; Nellcor Puritan Bennett, a division of Covidien Ltd.; and
Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited are the primary competitors for our products. Our principal international competitors are also Philips BV, DeVilbiss, and Nellcor Puritan Bennett, as well as regional manufacturers. The
disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry. In addition, our products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed to treat
OSA and other SDB related respiratory conditions. The development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive, which would harm our revenues and financial condition.

Any product developed by us that gains regulatory
clearance will have to compete for market acceptance and market share. An important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop products,
complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors. In addition, our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on the extent to which we
are successful in protecting our patents and other intellectual property.

Patents and Proprietary Rights and Related Litigation

Through our subsidiaries ResMed Limited, MAP
Medizin-Technologie GmbH, ResMed Motor Technologies Inc. and ResMed Paris SAS, we own or have licensed rights to approximately 450 issued United States patents (including approximately 200 design patents) and approximately 550 issued foreign
patents. In addition, there are approximately 400 pending United States patent applications (including approximately 80 design patent applications), approximately 800 pending foreign patent applications, approximately 1,000 registered foreign
designs and approximately 30 pending foreign designs. Some of these patents, patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products.

Of our patents, 31 United States patents and 59 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years, with 18 foreign
patents due to expire in 2011, 11 in 2012, 3 in 2013, 5 in 2014, and 32 in 2015; and with 4 United States patents due to expire in 2011, 2 United States patents in 2013, 6 United States patents in 2014, and 19 United States patents in 2015. We
believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and non-disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary
technology and rights.

Litigation may be
necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect our rights, or to defend third-party claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others. For example, we are currently appealing the decision of a court in Germany that entered
judgment in favor of certain plaintiffs that had claimed they should be listed as co-inventors on two of our German patent applications. The defense and prosecution of patent claims, including these pending claims, as well as participation in other
inter-party proceedings, can be expensive and time consuming, even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us. Patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country. Therefore, there can be no assurance
that patent issues will be uniformly resolved, or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits.

Government Regulations

Our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety, efficacy and adherence to FDA Quality System Regulation, and
related manufacturing standards. Medical device products are subject to rigorous FDA and other governmental agency regulations in the United States and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad. The FDA regulates the introduction, manufacture,
advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution and record keeping for such products, in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the United States are safe and effective for their intended use. In addition, the FDA is
authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions, fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspensions
or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, and criminal prosecution.

The FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new
medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval, or PMA, before introducing it into the U.S. market. Our products currently
marketed in the United States are marketed in reliance on 510(k) pre-marketing clearances as either Class I or Class II devices. The process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often
clinical data, which in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the FDA to be “substantially
equivalent” to such a pre-1976 device. As a result, FDA clearance requirements may extend the development process for a

- 18 -


considerable length of time. In addition, in some cases, the FDA may require additional review by an advisory panel, which can further lengthen the process. The PMA process, which is reserved for
new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for high-risk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life, may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical
information.

As a medical device manufacturer,
all of our domestic and Australian manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA. We believe that our design, manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the FDA’s regulatory
requirements.

Sales of medical devices outside
the United States are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Approval for sale of our medical devices in Europe is through the CE mark process. Where appropriate, our products are CE marked to the European
Union’s Medical Device Directive. Under the CE marketing scheme, our products are classified as either Class I or Class II. Our devices are listed in Australia with the Therapeutic Goods Administration, or TGA, and in Canada with Health Canada.

Employees

As of June 30, 2010, we had approximately 3,200
employees or full time consultants, of which approximately 1,300 persons were employed in warehousing and manufacturing, 400 in research and development and 1,500 in sales, marketing and administration. Of our employees and consultants,
approximately, 1,300 were located in Australia, 700 in North and South America, 1,000 in Europe and 200 in Asia.

We believe that the success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. None of our
employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.

During 2009-10, the Bella Vista Campus continued its commitment to providing a safe and healthy workplace for our employees, contractors
and visitors. This commitment is underpinned by an OHS policy with its focus to systematically eliminate hazards and statement of objectives as guidance. The Occupational Health and Safety Management System further integrated with the Quality
Management System, developing in maturity and ensuring compliance with local legislative requirements. The introduction of Positive Performance Indicators in 2009 continues to drive OHS continuous improvement and for the third consecutive year the
Bella Vista Campus has achieved a significant reduction in the rate of injury.

ACTORS

Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the
other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere, and the other information contained, in this Report and in our other filings with the SEC, including our subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. The risks and uncertainties
described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs
with material adverse effects on us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our common stock will likely decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.

Our inability to compete successfully in our
markets may harm our business.

The markets for our sleep-disordered breathing products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent

- 19 -


product improvements and evolving technology. Our ability to compete successfully depends, in part, on our ability to develop, manufacture and market innovative new products. The development of
innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete. Current competitors, new entrants, academics, and
others are trying to develop new devices, alternative treatments or cures, and pharmaceutical solutions to the conditions our products treat.

Additionally, some of our competitors have greater financial, research and development, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do.
The past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry and in the markets for our products. Industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources or if our
competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours. This competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and
sales and marketing. If we are unable to develop innovative new products, maintain competitive pricing, and offer products that consumers perceive to be as reliable as those of our competitors, our sales or gross margins could decrease which would
harm our business.

Our business depends on our
ability to market effectively to dealers of home healthcare products and sleep clinics.

We market our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose OSA and other sleep disorders. We
believe that home healthcare dealers and sleep clinics play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use. The success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to home healthcare dealers and sleep
clinics to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these third parties.

We have limited resources to market to approximately the 3,000 U.S. sleep clinics and the more than 6,000 home healthcare dealer branch
locations, most of which use, sell or recommend several brands of products. In addition, home healthcare dealers have experienced price pressures as government and third-party reimbursement has declined for home healthcare products, and home
healthcare dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us. We cannot assure you that sleep clinic physicians will continue to prescribe our products, or that home healthcare dealers or patients
will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written.

We have expanded our marketing activities to target the population with a predisposition to sleep-disordered breathing as well as primary
care physicians and various medical specialists. We cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products.

Any inability to market effectively our products outside the United States could impact our
profitability.

Approximately half our revenues are generated outside the United States, in over 70 different countries. Many of these countries have unique regulatory, medical and business environments, which may adversely
impact our ability to market our products. If we are unable to market effectively our products outside the United States, our overall financial performance could decline.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and
earnings.

Since our international sales and a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in local currencies and not in U.S. dollars, our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates. We had foreign currency transaction losses in recent periods and may have further losses in the future. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our business and that a significant
portion of our manufacturing costs and research and development costs will continue to be denominated in Australian dollars.

- 20 -


If we are unable to support our continued growth, our business could
suffer.

We have experienced rapid and substantial growth. As we continue to grow, the complexity of our operations increases, placing greater demands on our management. Our ability to manage our growth effectively depends
on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business including, the ability to monitor and improve manufacturing systems, information technology, and
quality and regulatory compliance systems, among others. Unexpected difficulties during expansion, the failure to attract and retain qualified employees, the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems, the failure
to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop. If we fail to manage our growth effectively and efficiently, our costs could increase faster than our revenues and our
business could suffer.

If we fail to integrate
our recent acquisitions with our operations, our business could suffer.

During the year ended June 30, 2010 we acquired Laboratories Narval. We continue to integrate this acquisition into our operations and we may
find it difficult to integrate the operations as personnel may leave and licensees, distributors or suppliers may terminate their arrangements or demand amended terms to these arrangements. Additionally, our management may have their attention
diverted while trying to integrate these companies. If we are not able to successfully integrate the operations, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions.

We are subject to various risks relating to international
activities that could affect our overall profitability.

We manufacture substantially all of our products outside the United States and sell a significant portion of our products in non-U.S. markets. Sales outside
North and Latin America accounted for approximately 46% and 46% of our net revenues in the years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 50% of our net revenues in the
foreseeable future. Our sales outside of North America and our operations in Europe, Australia and Asia are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in our U.S. operations, including:

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•

tariffs and other trade barriers;

•

compliance with foreign medical device manufacturing regulations;

•

difficulty in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;

•

reduction in third party payer reimbursement for our products;

•

inability to obtain import licenses;

•

changes in trade policies and in U.S. and foreign tax policies;

•

possible changes in export or import restrictions; and

•

the modification or introduction of other governmental policies with potentially adverse effects.

Any of the above factors may have a material adverse effect
on our ability to increase or maintain our foreign sales.

Government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse our customers for our products, which could result in reductions in
sales or selling prices for our products.

Our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for our products will be available from government health administration
authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. These third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can, without notice, deny coverage for treatments that may include the use
of the Company’s products. Therefore, even if a product is approved for

- 21 -


marketing, we cannot make assurances that coverage and reimbursement will be available for the product, that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or, that the reimbursement amount, even if
initially adequate, will not subsequently be reduced. For example, in some markets, such as Spain, France and Germany, government coverage and reimbursement are currently available for the purchase or rental of our products but is subject to
constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations. In other markets, such as Australia, there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleep-disordered breathing conditions. As we continue to develop new products,
those products will generally not qualify for coverage and reimbursement, if at all, until they are approved for marketing.

In the United States, we do not submit claims and bill governmental programs or other third party payors directly for
reimbursement for our products. We sell our products primarily to home healthcare dealers, hospitals and to sleep clinics. Any proposed reductions in reimbursement, if they occur, may have a material impact on our customers. Any material impact on
our customers may indirectly affect our sales to those customers, or the collectibility of receivables we have from those customers. For example, in 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) instructed
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program (CMS), to establish and implement programs under which competitive bidding areas (“CBAs”), would be established throughout
the United States for contract award purposes for the furnishing of competitively priced items of home medical equipment, including oxygen and oxygen equipment, CPAP and respiratory assist devices, and related supplies and accessories. On
July 2, 2010 CMS announced the single payment amount for round 1 of the competitive bidding, which included 9 CBAs, and began offering contracts to certain bidders. The average reduction from current Medicare payment rates in this

st

round of competitive bidding across the CBAs for CPAP
and respiratory assist devices is approximately 32%. If implemented, the proposed changes would be effective January 1, 2011. The expansion of round 2 of competitive bidding to a total of 91 CBA’s, if implemented, would be effective
January 1, 2013, and by 2016, the process must be nationalized or prices in non-competitive bidding areas must be adjusted to match competitive bidding prices. We cannot predict at this time which proposals CMS will adopt and what impact, if
any, they will have on our business and financial condition.

Health care reform, including recently enacted United States legislation, may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our
results of operations.

In March 2010, the President signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the
“PPACA”), which makes changes that are expected to impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. One of the principal aims of the PPACA as currently enacted is to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million
Americans who are currently uninsured. We cannot predict the impact of these coverage expansions, if any, on the sales of our products.

The PPACA also contains a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions among other
things. This includes new fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers. Beginning in 2013, with limited exceptions, entities that manufacture, produce or import medical devices will be required to pay a
deductible excise tax in an amount equal to 2.3 percent of the price for which such devices are sold in the United States. Though there are some exceptions to the excise tax, this excise tax does apply to all of the Company’s products. The
PPACA also includes, among other things, the expansion of round 2 of competitive bidding to a total of 91 CBA’s, and by 2016, the process must be nationalized or prices in non-competitive bidding areas must be adjusted to match competitive
bidding prices; and the establishment of a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research.

- 22 -


Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level in the United
States. We cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us. The taxes imposed by the new federal legislation and, the expansion
in the federal government’s role in the U.S. healthcare industry and the increased funding and focus on comparative clinical effectiveness research that compares and evaluates the risks and benefits, clinical outcomes, effectiveness and
appropriateness of products may result in decreased profits to us, lower reimbursements by payors for our products, and reduced medical procedure volumes. The PPACA as well as other state and/or federal healthcare reform measures that may be adopted
in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Failure to comply with anti-kickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business
operations.

In particular, the federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an
individual, or the furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The U.S. government has interpreted this law broadly to
apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us.

The recently enacted PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal health care fraud
statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a
violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. Many states and other governments have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Law. We are also subject to
other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any third party payer. These laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private
third party payers. These laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage, coding, and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill third party payers. Any violation of these laws and regulations could
result in civil and criminal penalties (including fines), increased legal expenses and exclusions from governmental reimbursement programs, all of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial conditions and results of
operations.

The PPACA also imposes new reporting
and disclosure requirements on device and drug manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers, effective March 30, 2013. Such information will be made publicly available in
a searchable format beginning September 30, 2013. In addition, device and drug manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding
calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of
value or ownership or investment interests not reported.

Complying with Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other regulations is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure
to comply could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, or results of operations.

We are subject to various federal, state, local and international regulations regarding our
business activities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in, among other things, recalls of our products, substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees. Furthermore, our products could be subject to
recall if the FDA or we determine, for any reason, that our products are not safe or effective. Any recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs, damage our reputation, affect

- 23 -


our ability to supply customers with the quantity of products they require and materially affect our operating results. For example, in April 2007 we announced a worldwide voluntary product
recall of approximately 300,000 of our S8 flow generators manufactured between July 2004 and May 2006. We determined that there was a remote potential for a short circuit in the power connector. To date, no significant property damage or patient
injury has been reported. The cost of this action was $62.8 million which accounted for factors such as the return of affected units, unit replacement costs, legal, consulting, logistical and temporary contractor expenses directly associated with
the recall. There is no remaining recall accrual for fiscal year 2010.

Product sales, introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of FDA regulations or similar foreign regulations,
which could cause our sales and profits to decline.

Before we can market or sell a new medical device in the United States, we must obtain FDA clearance, which can be a lengthy and time-consuming process. We generally
receive clearance from the FDA to market our products in the United States under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or our products are exempt from the Section 510(k) clearance process. We have modified some of our
Section 510(k) approved products without submitting new Section 510(k) notices, which we do not believe were required. However, if the FDA disagrees with us and requires us to submit new Section 510(k) notifications for modifications
to our existing products, we may be required to stop marketing the products while the FDA reviews the Section 510(k) notification.

Any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier, more rigorous FDA examination process.
For example, in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510(k) notice. We may also be required to obtain premarket approvals for certain of our products. In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating
the Section 510(k) clearance process and may make substantial changes to the process and associated industry requirements, including the requirements related to which devices are eligible for Section 510(k) clearance and which devices
which may be used as predicates in demonstrating substantial equivalence, and the grounds and procedures under which FDA may rescind a Section 510(k) clearance. The requirements of the more rigorous premarket approval process and/or significant
changes to the Section 510(k) clearance process could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with FDA compliance. Marketing and sale of our products outside the United States are also subject to regulatory clearances and
approvals, and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals, our sales could suffer. We cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from U.S. or foreign regulatory agencies.

We are subject to substantial regulation related to
quality standards applicable to its manufacturing and quality processes. Our failure to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

The FDA
regulates the approval, manufacturing, and sales and marketing of many of our products in the U.S. Significant government regulation also exists in Canada, Japan, Europe, and other countries in which we conduct business. As a device manufacturer, we
are required to register with the FDA and is subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain
regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a
device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is
rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. In the European Community, we are required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and
maintain these certifications. Failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing

- 24 -


shutdowns, product recalls or related field actions, product shortages or delays in product manufacturing. Efficacy or safety concerns, an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace,
and/or manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls or related field actions, withdrawals, and/or declining sales.

Off-label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties.

Clearance under
Section 510(k) only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the FDA. We may request additional label indications for our current products, and the FDA may deny those requests outright, require
additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance. If the FDA determines that we have marketed our products for off-label use, we
could be subject to fines, injunctions or other penalties.

Disruptions in the supply of components from our single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and
profitability.

We purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from various suppliers, including some who are single-source suppliers for us. We cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to
configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or, in the alternative, that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part. A reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its
components, or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part, would limit our ability to manufacture our devices, which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability. We cannot assure you that our inventories would
be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply.

We are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage, which would expose
us to liability for uninsured claims.

We are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. In April 2007 we announced a worldwide voluntary product
recall of approximately 300,000 of our S8 flow generators manufactured between July 2004 and May 2006. We determined that there was a remote potential for a short circuit in the power connector. To date, no significant property damage or patient
injury has been reported. However, we would likely be subject to product liability claims should any of these devices malfunction, resulting in injury to a patient or damage to property. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or
without merit, could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates. In addition, we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits. Our insurance policies have various exclusions, and thus we may be
subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage, in which case, we may have to pay the entire amount of any award. We cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us
will be covered by our insurance and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. A successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage, if
any, may require us to pay substantial amounts, which could harm our business.

Our intellectual property may not protect our products, and/or our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third
parties.

We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain United States and foreign
patent protection for our products, their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. We have a number of pending patent applications, and we do not know whether
any patents will issue from any of these applications. We do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially
valuable. Legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving, and there is no

- 25 -


consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims. Additionally, there may be third party patents, patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and
technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products.

We face the risks that:

•

third parties will infringe our intellectual property rights;

•

our non-disclosure agreements will be breached;

•

we will not have adequate remedies for infringement;

•

our trade secrets will become known to or independently developed by our competitors; or

•

third parties will be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or require us to license and pay fees or royalties in order for us to be
able to market some of our products.

Litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect our proprietary rights, or to defend third party claims that we
have infringed upon proprietary rights of others. The defense and prosecution of patent claims, including these pending claims, as well as participation in other inter-party proceedings, can be expensive and time consuming, even in those instances
in which the outcome is favorable to us. If the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse, we could be subject to significant liabilities to third parties, could be required to obtain licenses from third parties, could
be forced to design around the patents at issue or could be required to cease sales of the affected products. A license may not be available at all or on commercially viable terms, and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid
infringement. Additionally, the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country, and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved, or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights
and benefits.

We are subject to tax audits by
various tax authorities in many jurisdictions.

From time to time we may be audited by the tax authorities and are still subject to an ongoing German tax audit. Any final assessment resulting from this audit could result in
material changes to our past or future taxable income, tax payable or deferred tax assets, and could require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results.

Our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation
for a variety of reasons.

Our operating results have, from time to time, fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future. These fluctuations may result from a number of factors,
including:

•

the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;

•

the geographic mix of product sales;

•

the success and costs of our marketing efforts in new regions;

•

changes in third party reimbursement;

•

timing of regulatory clearances and approvals;

•

timing of orders by distributors;

•

expenditures incurred for research and development;

•

competitive pricing in different regions;

•

the effect of foreign currency transaction gains or losses; and

•

other activities of our competitors.

- 26 -


Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common
stock to fluctuate.

If a natural or man-made
disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities, we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability will decline.

Our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we
use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead-time to repair or replace. The facilities may be affected by natural or man-made disasters and in the event they were affected by a disaster, we would be
forced to rely on third party manufacturers. Although we believe we possess adequate insurance for the disruption of our business from casualties, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be
available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.

Delaware law and provisions in our charter and could make it difficult for another company to acquire
us.

Provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security holders. In particular, our Board of
Directors is divided into three classes, serving for staggered three-year terms. Because of this classification it will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors constituting a majority of our Board of Directors. Additionally, our
Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without further vote or action by the
stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect
of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights
of the holders of our common stock.

We may not
be able to enforce the judgments of U.S. courts against some of our assets or officers and directors.

A substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States. Additionally, two of our eight directors and
three of our six executive officers reside outside the United States, along with all or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments of U.S. courts relating to any
liabilities under U.S. securities laws against our assets, those persons or their assets. In addition, we have been advised by our Australian counsel that some doubt exists as to the ability of investors to pursue claims based on U.S. securities
laws against these assets or these persons in Australian courts.

Our results of operations may be materially affected by global economic conditions generally, including conditions in the financial
markets.

Recently, concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the United States mortgage market and a declining residential real estate market in the United States have
contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets going forward. These factors, combined with volatile oil prices, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have
precipitated an economic slowdown. It is difficult to predict how long the current economic conditions will continue and whether the economic conditions will continue to deteriorate. If the economic climate in the United States or outside
the United States continues to deteriorate or there is a shift in government spending priorities, customers or potential customers could reduce or delay their purchases, which could impact our revenue, our ability to manage inventory levels, collect
customer receivables, and ultimately decrease our profitability.

ROCEEDINGS

In the normal course of business, we are subject to routine litigation incidental to our business. While the results of this litigation
cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that their final outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

During September and October 2004, we began receiving tax assessment notices for the audit of one of our German subsidiaries
by the German tax authorities for the years 1996 through 1998. Certain aspects of these assessment notices are being contested and appealed to the German tax authority office. As the outcome of the appeal cannot be predicted with certainty, any tax
issues resolved in a manner not consistent with our expectations may require us to adjust our provision for income tax in the period of resolution.

In February 2007, the University of Sydney commenced legal action in the Federal Court of Australia against us, claiming breach of a
license agreement and infringement of certain intellectual property. The claim has been amended to include an allegation of breach of confidentiality. The university is seeking various types of relief, including an injunction against manufacturing,
supplying, offering for sale, selling or exporting certain mask devices, payment of license fees, damages or an account of profits, interest, costs and declaration of a constructive trust over and assignment of certain intellectual property. In
October 2007, we filed a defense denying the university’s claim, as well as a cross-claim against the university seeking an order for rectification of the contract and alleging the university violated the Australian Trade Practices Act. The
matter is ongoing. We do not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In January 2010, Vaughn Medical Equipment Repair Service, L.L.C., filed a complaint in the
U.S. District court in Louisiana, against us and other defendants, alleging, among other things, anti-competitive conduct, conspiracy, defamation and tortious interference. We have filed our initial response to the suit, asking the court
to dismiss the case. We do not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Overview

Management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the
reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Resmed Inc. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes, included
herein.

We are a leading developer, manufacturer
and distributor of medical equipment for treating, diagnosing, and managing sleep-disordered breathing (“SDB”) and other respiratory disorders. During the fiscal year, we continued our efforts to build awareness of the consequences of
untreated SDB and to grow our business in this market. In our efforts, we have attempted to raise awareness through market and clinical initiatives and by highlighting the increasing link between the potential effects SDB can have on cardiovascular
diseases and Type 2 diabetes.

In September 2008,
the European Society of Cardiologists published guidelines for the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure. The guidelines noted that patients with symptomatic heart failure frequently have sleep-related disorders (central or obstructive sleep
apnea) and recommended treatment with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, or CPAP, for patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. In June 2008, the International Diabetes Federation issued a consensus statement on sleep disordered breathing
and Type 2 Diabetes, where the substantial value of identifying and treating diabetic patients suffering from sleep disordered breathing was recognized and recommended. The National Institutes of Health released a clinical study in April 2010
reporting that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of stroke in middle-aged and older adults, especially men. In a recently released study in Circulation, it was reported that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an
increased risk of incident heart failure in a general community of middle-aged and older men. Specifically, men ages 40 to 70 with AHI

³

30 were 68% more likely to develop coronary heart disease than those
with AHI<5. This is just one of many studies being conducted that provide new evidence that treating sleep-disordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea can improve health, quality of life and also mitigate the dangers of sleep apnea in
occupational health and safety, especially in the transport industry. we may experience continued growth from the increasing awareness of the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing, obstructive sleep apnea and co-morbidities such as cardiac
disease, diabetes, hypertension and obesity.

We
are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements. During fiscal year 2010, we invested approximately $75.2 million on research and development activities, which represents 7% of revenue. Since the development
of CPAP, we have developed a number of innovative products for the treatment of SDB and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators, diagnostic products, mask systems, headgear and other accessories.

During fiscal year 2010, we released new products across both
our mask and flow generator categories. We have introduced new masks during fiscal 2010, including the Swift™ FX mask and the Mirage™ SoftGel mask. Additionally, we released the S9™ AutoSet and Elite flow generators. These products
have an improved comfort and sleek, bedroom-friendly design but most importantly have been developed to drive greater patient adherence to therapy.

We reported record financial results in fiscal year 2010, with an increase in net revenue of 19% to $1,092.4 million compared to fiscal
year 2009. Gross profit increased for the year ended June 30, 2010 to $655.5 million from $553.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, an increase of $101.7 million or 18%. Our net income for the year ended June 30, 2010 was
$190.1 million or $2.45 per diluted share compared to net income of $146.4 million or $1.90 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2009.

Total operating cash flow for fiscal year 2010 was $188.2 million and at June 30, 2010,
our cash and cash equivalents totaled $488.8 million. Our total assets increased by 9% to $1.6 billion and our shareholders’ equity was up 15% to $1.3 billion. During fiscal year 2010, we repurchased 2,519,843 shares at a cost of $135.8 million
under our share buy-back program.

Fiscal Year
Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2009

Net Revenues.

Net revenue increased for the year ended June 30, 2010 to $1,092.4 million from
$920.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, an increase of $171.6 million or 19%. The increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our flow generators, masks and accessories. Movements in international
currencies against the U.S. dollar positively impacted revenues by approximately $11.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2010. Excluding the impact of favorable foreign currency movements, sales for the year ended June 30, 2010 increased
by 17% compared to the year ended June 30, 2009.

Net revenue in North and Latin America increased for the year ended June 30, 2010 to $590.4 million from $493.4 million for the year
ended June 30, 2009, an increase of $97.0 million or 20%. We believe this growth has been generated by increased public and physician awareness of SDB and from our recent product releases including the S9™ AutoSet and Elite flow generators
and the Swift™ FX and Mirage™ SoftGel masks.

Net revenue in markets outside North and Latin America increased for the year ended June 30, 2010 to $502.0 million from $427.3
million for the year ended June 30, 2009, an increase of $74.6 million or 17%. Excluding the impact of favorable foreign currency movements, international sales grew by 15%. This sales growth outside North and Latin America predominantly
reflects growth in the overall sleep-disordered breathing market and growth generated from our recent product releases including the S9™ AutoSet and Elite flow generators and the Swift™ FX and Mirage™ SoftGel masks.

Sales of flow generators for the year ended June 30,
2010 totaled $633.6 million from $532.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, an increase of 19%, including increases of 18% in North and Latin America and 20% elsewhere. Sales of mask systems, motors and other accessories totaled $458.8
million, an increase of 18%, including increases of 22% in North and Latin America and 12% elsewhere, for the year ended June 30, 2010, compared to the year ended June 30, 2009. We believe these primarily reflect growth in the overall SDB
market and contributions from new products.

The
following table summarizes the percentage movements in our net revenue for the year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the year ended June 30, 2009:

* Constant currency numbers exclude the impact of movements
in international currencies.

Gross
Profit.

Gross profit increased for the year ended June 30, 2010 to $655.5 million from $553.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, an increase of $101.7 million or 18%. Gross profit as a percentage of net
revenue remained at 60% for the year ended June 30, 2010 which is consistent with the 60% for the year ended June 30, 2009. Gross margins were positively impacted by a favorable change in product mix as sales of our higher margin products
represented a higher proportion of our sales and cost savings attributable to manufacturing and supply chain improvements. These impacts

- 35 -


were offset by negative impacts associated with declines in our average selling prices and the appreciation of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar as the majority of our manufacturing
labor and overhead is denominated in Australian dollars.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the
year ended June 30, 2010 to $328.9 million from $289.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, an increase of $39.0 million or 13%. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended
June 30, 2010 was 30% compared to 31% for the year ended June 30, 2009.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative
personnel to support our growth, stock-based compensation costs and other expenses related to the increase in our sales including activities targeted at increasing the awareness and diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing. The increase in selling,
general and administrative expenses was also due to the net appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar, which increased our selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $9.7 million for the year ended
June 30, 2010 as reported in U.S. dollars. As a percentage of net revenue, we expect our future selling, general and administrative expense to continue to be broadly in the range of 30%.

Research and Development
Expenses.

Research and development expenses increased for the year ended June 30, 2010 to $75.2 million from $63.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, an increase of $12.1 million or 19%. As a percentage of
net revenue, research and development expenses were 7% for the year ended June 30, 2010 and are consistent with the year ended June 30, 2009.

The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel,
increased charges for consulting fees and an increase in clinical trial costs. The increase in research and development expenses was also due to the net appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar, which increased our research
and development expenses by approximately $8.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2010, as reported in U.S. dollars. As a percentage of net revenue, we expect our future research and development expense to continue to be broadly in the range
of 7%.

Donations to Research
Foundation.

In the years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, we donated $3.0 million and $3.5 million, respectively, to the ResMed Foundation. The Foundation was established primarily to promote research into the
deleterious medical consequences of untreated sleep-disordered breathing and to increase public and physician awareness of the importance of sleep and respiratory health throughout the world.

Amortization of Acquired Intangible
Assets.

Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended June 30, 2010 totaled $8.0 million compared to $7.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2009. The increase in amortization expense is
attributable to the acquisition of Laboratories Narval SA and the appreciation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar as the majority of the acquired intangible assets are denominated in Euros.

Other Income (Expense),
Net.

Other income, net for the year ended June 30, 2010 was $20.2 million, a increase of $8.8 million over the year ended June 30, 2009 of $11.4 million. The increase in other income, net, was predominately due
to gains on foreign currency and hedging transactions and an increase in interest income, net, due to additional cash balances and a reduction in our long-term debt.

- 36 -


Income Taxes.

Our effective income tax rate decreased to 27.1%
for the year ended June 30, 2010 from 27.4% for the year ended June 30, 2009. The lower tax rate was primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of taxable income, including the impact of lower taxes associated with our new Singapore
manufacturing operation. We continue to benefit from the Australian corporate tax rate of 30% and certain Australian research and development tax benefits because we generate the majority of our taxable income in Australia.

Net Income.

As a result of the
factors above, our net income for the year ended June 30, 2010 was $190.1 million or $2.45 per diluted share compared to net income of $146.4 million or $1.90 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2009, an increase of 30% and 29%,
respectively, over the year ended June 30, 2009.

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2009 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2008

Net Revenues.

Net
revenue increased for the year ended June 30, 2009 to $920.7 million from $835.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2008, an increase of $85.3 million or 10%. The increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of
our flow generators, masks and accessories. Movements in international currencies against the U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenues by approximately $40.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2009. Excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign
currency movements, sales for the year ended June 30, 2009 increased by 15% compared to the year ended June 30, 2008.

Net revenue in North and Latin America increased for the year ended June 30, 2009 to $493.4 million from $409.6 million for the year
ended June 30, 2008, an increase of $83.8 million or 20%. This growth has been generated by increased public and physician awareness of sleep-disordered breathing and growth generated from our recent product releases including the S8II flow
generator, VPAP Auto 25, VPAP S, Swift LT nasal pillows mask and Mirage Quattro full-face mask.

Net revenue in markets outside North and Latin America increased for the year ended June 30, 2009 to $427.3 million from $425.8
million for the year ended June 30, 2008, an increase of $1.5 million or 0.4%. Movements in international currencies against the U.S. dollar negatively impacted international revenues by approximately $40.3 million for the year ended
June 30, 2009. Excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency movements, international sales grew by 10%. This sales growth outside North and Latin America predominantly reflects growth in the overall sleep-disordered breathing market,
growth generated from our recent product releases including the S8II flow generator, VPAP S, VPAP ST and Mirage Quattro full-face mask offset by the negative impact from movements of international currencies against the U.S. dollar.

Sales of flow generators for the year ended June 30,
2009 totaled $532.1 million from $484.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2008, an increase of 10%, including increases of 21% in North and Latin America and 2% elsewhere. Sales of mask systems, motors and other accessories totaled $388.6
million, an increase of 11%, including increase of 20% in North and Latin America offset by a decrease of 2% elsewhere, for the year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the year ended June 30, 2008. We believe these primarily reflect growth
in the overall sleep-disordered breathing market and contributions from new products, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements in sales outside of North and Latin America.

Gross Profit.

Gross profit
increased for the year ended June 30, 2009 to $553.8 million from $493.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2008, an increase of $60.1 million or 12%. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased for the year ended June 30,
2009 to 60% from 59% for the year ended June 30, 2008. The increase in gross margins is primarily due to the depreciation of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar as the majority of our manufacturing labor and overhead is

denominated in Australian dollars, a favorable change in product mix as sales of our higher margin products represented a higher proportion of our sales and cost savings attributable to
manufacturing and supply chain improvements.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the
year ended June 30, 2009 to $289.9 million from $278.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2008, an increase of $11.8 million or 4%. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended
June 30, 2009 was 31% compared to 33% for the year ended June 30, 2008.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative
personnel to support our growth, stock-based compensation costs and other expenses related to the increase in our sales. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was also offset by the net appreciation of the U.S. dollar against
international currencies, which reduced by approximately $21.8 million our expenses for the year ended June 30, 2009, as reported in U.S. dollars.

Research and Development Expenses.

Research and development expenses increased for the year ended
June 30, 2009 to $63.1 million from $60.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2008, an increase of $2.5 million or 4%. As a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 7% for the year ended June 30, 2009 and are
consistent with the year ended June 30, 2008.

The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel,
increased charges for consulting fees and an increase in clinical trials, including the SERVE-HF study. The increase in research and development expenses was also offset by the net appreciation of the U.S. dollar against international currencies,
which reduced our expenses by approximately $11.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2009, as reported in U.S. dollars.

Donations to Research Foundation.

In the years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, we donated $3.5 million
and $2.0 million, respectively, to the ResMed Foundation. The Foundation was established primarily to promote research into the deleterious medical consequences of untreated sleep-disordered breathing.

Amortization of Acquired Intangible
Assets.

Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended June 30, 2009 totaled $7.1 million compared to $7.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease in amortization expense is
attributable to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Euro as the majority of the acquired intangible assets are denominated in Euros.

Restructuring Expenses.

Restructuring expenses incurred for the year ended June 30, 2009 were $Nil
compared to $2.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2008. Restructuring expenses in the prior year consisted of expenses associated with our decision to streamline European management, including the closure of part of the European headquarters
in Basel, Switzerland and two regional offices in the Netherlands. The restructuring expenses mainly comprise employee termination costs, leasehold improvement write-downs and property lease exit costs. We will continue to monitor the progress of
this restructure and adjust our business strategies and personnel accordingly to achieve maximum efficiencies and cost savings.

Other Income (Expense), Net.

Other income, net for the year ended June 30, 2009 was $11.4 million, a
decrease of $3.5 million over the year ended June 30, 2008 of $14.9 million. This was predominantly due a $5.9 million gain on the sale of our Poway property, that was reported in year ended June 30, 2008 which was partly offset by a $3.2
million impairment write-down of our at cost-method investments in the same fiscal year.

- 38 -


Income Taxes.

Our effective income tax rate decreased to 27.4%
for the year ended June 30, 2009 from 30.1% for the year ended June 30, 2008. The lower tax rate was primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of taxable income, including the impact of lower taxes associated with our new Singapore
manufacturing operation. We continue to benefit from the Australian corporate tax rate of 30% and certain Australian research and development tax benefits because we generate the majority of our taxable income in Australia.

Net Income.

As a result of the
factors above, our net income for the year ended June 30, 2009 was $146.4 million or $1.90 per diluted share compared to net income of $110.3 million or $1.40 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2008, an increase of 33% and 36%,
respectively, over the year ended June 30, 2008.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents of $488.8 million and $415.7 million, respectively.
Working capital was $672.7 million and $584.2 million at June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009, respectively. The increase in working capital predominantly reflects the growth and profitability of the business during the year.

Inventories at June 30, 2010 increased by $28.2 million
or 18% to $185.6 million compared to June 30, 2009 inventories of $157.4 million. The increase in inventories was lower than the increase of 19% in net revenues in the year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the year ended June 30, 2009
due to improved inventory management.

Accounts
receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts at June 30, 2010 were $226.9 million, an increase of $14.8 million or 7% over the June 30, 2009 accounts receivable balance of $212.1 million. The increase was lower than the 19%
incremental increase in net revenues for the year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the year ended June 30, 2009. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding of 71 days at June 30, 2010 decreased by 3 days compared to 74 days at
June 30, 2009. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total accounts receivable at June 30, 2010 and 2009 was 3.3% and 3.4%, respectively. The credit quality of our customers remains broadly consistent with our past
experience.

During the year ended June 30,
2010, we generated cash of $188.2 million from operations. This was lower than the cash generated from operations for the year ended June 30, 2009 of $238.9 million and was primarily the result of an increase in income tax payments. Movements
in foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended June 30, 2010 had the effect of increasing our cash and cash equivalents by $4.4 million, as reported in U.S. dollars. During fiscal years 2010 and 2009, we repurchased 2,519,843 and
1,826,307 shares at a cost of $135.8 million and $65.7 million, respectively.

Capital expenditures for the years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 aggregated $56.9 million and $109.7 million, respectively. The
capital expenditures for the year ended June 30, 2010 primarily reflected computer hardware and software, rental and loan equipment and purchase of production tooling equipment and machinery. As a result of these capital expenditures, our
balance sheet reflects net property, plant and equipment of approximately $387.1 million at June 30, 2010 compared to $377.6 million at June 30, 2009.

Details of other commercial commitments at June 30, 2010
are as follows:

*

The above guarantees mainly relate to
security provided as part of our Syndicated Facility Agreement and requirements under contractual obligations with insurance companies transacting with our German subsidiaries.

Revolving Facility

On April 30, 2010, ResMed Inc., and our wholly-owned
subsidiaries, ResMed Corp., ResMed EAP Holdings Inc. and ResMed Motor Technologies Inc., entered into a Fourth Amendment to the March 1, 2006 Second Amended and Restated Revolving Loan Agreement (“the Loan Agreement”) with Union Bank,
N.A (formerly Union Bank of California, N.A). The Loan Agreement was modified in order that the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio was revised to exclude all indebtedness owing to Union Bank, N.A.

The entire outstanding principal amount must be repaid in
full before March 1, 2011. The outstanding principal amount due under the revolving facility will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.75% to 1.00% (depending on the applicable leverage ratio). At June 30, 2010, there was $64.1
million outstanding under this revolving facility which was bearing interest at a rate of approximately 1.1%.

The obligations of ResMed Corp., ResMed Motor Technologies Inc. and ResMed EAP Holdings Inc. under the Loan Agreement are secured by
substantially all of the personal property of each of ResMed Corp., ResMed Motor Technologies Inc. and ResMed EAP Holdings Inc., and are guaranteed by ResMed Inc. under an Amended and Restated Continuing Guaranty and Pledge Agreement, which guaranty
is secured by a pledge of the equity interests in ResMed Corp., ResMed Motor Technologies Inc. and ResMed EAP Holdings Inc. held by ResMed Inc. The Loan Agreement also contains customary covenants, including certain financial covenants and an
obligation that ResMed Inc. maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Loan Agreement), a fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum tangible net worth, and a minimum ResMed Corp., ResMed
Motor Technologies Inc. and ResMed EAP Holdings Inc. EBITDA.

- 40 -


The entire principal amount of the revolving facility and any accrued but unpaid interest
may be declared immediately due and payable in the event of the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the Loan Agreement. Events of default include, among other items, failure to make payments when due, the occurrence of a material default
in the performance of any covenants in the Loan Agreement or related amendments or a 35% or more change in control of ResMed Inc., ResMed Corp., ResMed Motor Technologies Inc. or ResMed EAP Holdings Inc. At June 30, 2010, we were in compliance
with our debt covenants.

Syndicated Facility

On June 8, 2006, our wholly owned
Australian subsidiary, ResMed Limited, entered into a Syndicated Facility Agreement with HSBC Bank Australia Limited as original financier, facility agent and security trustee, that provides for a loan in three tranches (the “Syndicated
Facility Agreement”).

Tranche A is a Euro
(“EUR”) 50 million five-year term loan facility that refinanced all amounts outstanding under a syndicated facility agreement dated May 16, 2005, between ResMed Limited and HSBC Bank Australia Limited, to fund the obligations of
our wholly owned French subsidiary ResMed SAS under its agreement to acquire Saime SAS. Tranche A bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR for deposits denominated in EUR plus a margin of 0.80% or 0.90%, depending on the ratio of the total debt to
EBITDA of ResMed Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “ResMed Group”) for the most recently completed fiscal year for the applicable interest period. The entire outstanding principal amount must be repaid in full on June 8, 2011. At
June 30, 2010, the Tranche A facility loan had an amount outstanding of EUR 15.0 million, equivalent to approximately U.S. dollars (“USD”) 18.4 million, which was bearing interest at a rate of approximately 1.2%.

Tranche B is a USD 15 million term loan facility that
may only be used for the purpose of financing capital expenditures and other asset acquisitions by the ResMed Group. Tranche B bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR for deposits denominated in EUR, Australian dollars, USD or British Pounds
Sterling plus a margin of 0.80% or 0.90%, depending on the ratio of the total debt to EBITDA of the ResMed Group for the most recently completed fiscal year for the applicable interest period. The entire principal amount must be repaid in full on
June 8, 2011. At June 30, 2010, there was USD 9.0 million outstanding under this loan facility, which was bearing interest at a rate of approximately 1.1%.

Tranche C was a USD 60 million term loan facility that could only be used for the purpose of the payment by ResMed
Limited of a dividend to ResMed Holdings Limited, which would ultimately be paid to ResMed Inc. Tranche C bore interest at a rate equal to LIBOR for deposits denominated in EUR, Australian dollars or USD plus a margin of 0.70% or 0.80%, depending on
the ratio of the total debt to EBITDA of the ResMed Group for the most recently completed fiscal year for the applicable interest period. The entire outstanding principal amount was repaid in full during the year ended June 30, 2009. At
June 30, 2010, the Tranche C loan facility was no longer available.

Simultaneous with the Syndicated Facility Agreement, ResMed Limited entered into a working capital agreement with HSBC Bank Australia
Limited for revolving, letter of credit and overdraft facilities up to a total commitment of 6.5 million Australian dollars, and ResMed (UK) Limited entered into a working capital agreement with HSBC Bank plc for a revolving cash advance
facility for a total commitment of up to 3 million British Pounds Sterling. At June 30, 2010, there were no amounts outstanding under either of these facilities.

On September 30, 2008, our wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, ResMed Limited, agreed to amend and restate the Syndicated
Facility Agreement entered into on June 8, 2006. The amended and restated agreement (“First Amended and Restated Syndicated Facility Agreement”) with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Sydney Branch as financier and HSBC
Bank Australia Limited as

- 41 -


facility agent and security trustee, provided for an additional Tranche D term loan facility in the amount of USD 50 million.

On September 30, 2009, ResMed Limited agreed to amend
and restate for a second time the Syndicated Facility Agreement. The second amended and restated agreement (“Second Amended and Restated Syndicated Facility Agreement”) provides for the extension of our Tranche D term loan facility in the
amount of USD 50 million for an additional 12 month period and to increase the interest rate applicable to the Tranche D portion of the loan facility. The financier continues to have the right to assign part or all of its rights and/or
obligations under the Second Amended and Restated Syndicated Facility Agreement to other financial institutions. The extended Tranche D loan facility bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR for deposits denominated in USD, plus a margin of 2.25% or
2.50%, depending on the ratio of the total debt to EBITDA of the ResMed Group for the most recently completed fiscal year for the applicable interest period. The entire principal amount of the additional loan facility must be repaid in full by
September 30, 2010. At June 30, 2010, there was USD 30.0 million outstanding under the Tranche D loan facility, which was bearing interest at a rate of approximately 2.6%.

The Syndicated Facility Agreement is secured by a pledge of
one hundred percent of the shares of ResMed Inc.’s subsidiary, ResMed Paris SAS (formerly Saime SA), pursuant to a pledge agreement. The Syndicated Facility Agreement also contains customary covenants, including certain financial covenants and
an obligation that ResMed Limited maintains certain financial ratios, including a minimum debt service cover ratio, a maximum ratio of total debt to EBITDA and a minimum tangible net worth. The entire principal amount of the loan and any accrued,
but unpaid, interest may be declared immediately due and payable in the event of the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the Syndicated Facility Agreement. Events of default include, among other items, failure to make payments when due,
breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, the occurrence of certain insolvency events, the occurrence of an event or change which could have a material adverse effect on ResMed Limited and its subsidiaries, and if ResMed Inc. ceases to
control ResMed Limited, ResMed Corp., ResMed SAS, ResMed GmbH & Co. KG, ResMed (UK) Limited, Take Air Medical Handels-GmbH or ResMed Paris SAS.

The obligations of ResMed Limited under the loan facility are subject to two guarantee and indemnity agreements, one on behalf of ResMed
Inc. and its U.S. subsidiary, ResMed Corp., and another on behalf of ResMed’s international subsidiaries, ResMed SAS (other than Tranche C), ResMed GmbH & Co. KG, ResMed (UK) Limited and Take Air Medical Handels-GmbH. At June 30,
2010, we were in compliance with our debt covenants.

Prepayment Facility

During the year ended June 30, 2010, ResMed EPN Limited, our wholly-owned UK subsidiary, obtained access to a Prepayment Facility
with HSBC Invoice Finance (UK) Limited that provides for a cash advance facility up to a total commitment of 5 million British Pounds Sterling. These advances are limited to 75% of secured outstanding sales invoices. At June 30, 2010,
there were no amounts outstanding under this facility

We expect to satisfy all of our short-term liquidity requirements through a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from
operations.

Stock-Based Compensation Costs

We have granted stock options and restricted
stock units to personnel, including officers and directors, under the ResMed Inc. 2009 Incentive Award Plan (the “2009 Plan”), the 2006 Incentive Award Plan,

- 42 -


as amended (the “2006 Plan”) and the Amended and Restated ResMed Inc. 2006 Incentive Award Plan (the “2006 Amended Plan”). These options and restricted stock units have
expiration dates of seven years from the date of grant and vest over one or four years. We granted the options with the exercise price equal to the market value as determined at the date of grant. We have also offered to our personnel, including
officers, the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount under the ResMed Inc. 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”).

We measure the compensation expense of all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize the compensation expense
over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, using the straight-line method for stock-based
awards. The fair value of restricted stock units is equal to the market value as determined at the date of grant.

The fair value of stock options granted under our stock option plans and purchase rights granted under the ESPP is estimated on the date
of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model assuming no dividends and using the following assumptions:

Expected volatilities are based on a combination of
historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from traded options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options. We use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as we believe the addition of the
implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends. While there is a tradable market of options on our common stock, less emphasis is placed on the implied volatility of these options due to the relative low volumes of these
traded options and the difference in the terms compared to our employee options. The expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our
historical exercise patterns. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option.

Tax Expense

Our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions
in which our income is recognized. To date, a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in Australia where the statutory rate was 30% in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008. During fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, our
consolidated effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately 27% and approximately 30%. These fluctuations have resulted from, and future effective tax rates will depend upon, numerous factors, including the amount of research and
development expenditures for which a an additional Australian tax deduction is available, the geographic mix of taxable income and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws.

- 43 -


We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory adjustments, warranty obligations, goodwill, impaired assets, intangible assets, income taxes, deferred tax valuation
allowances and stock-based compensation costs.

We
state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis. The estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of
our consolidated financial statements:

(1)    Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments, which results in bad debt expense. We determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables, considering a customer’s
financial condition, credit history and current economic conditions. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

(2)    Inventory
Adjustments. Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the first-in, first-out method. We review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future
usage and sales. The likelihood of any material inventory write-downs is dependent on changes in competitive conditions, new product introductions by us or our competitors, or rapid changes in customer demand.

(3)    Valuation of Goodwill, Intangible
and Other Long-Lived Assets. We use assumptions in establishing the carrying value, fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets. The criteria used for these evaluations include management’s
estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset, as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible
asset in our business objectives. If assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Useful lives and related amortization or depreciation
expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. Factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the
asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow, loss of legal ownership or title to the asset, a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends, significant changes in our strategic business
objectives, utilization of the asset, and a significant change in the economic and/or political conditions in certain countries.

- 44 -


(4)    Valuation of Deferred Income Taxes. Valuation allowances are
established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, our ability to deduct tax loss
carryforwards against future taxable income, the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in, and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations.

(5)    Provision for
Warranty. We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The amount of this provision is determined by using a financial model, which takes into consideration actual, historical expenses
and potential risks associated with our different products. This financial model is then used to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision. Although we engage in product improvement
programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures. Should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our
estimates, revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required.

(6)    Revenue Recognition. Revenue on product sales is recorded at the time of shipment, at which time title
transfers to the customer. Revenue on product sales which require customer acceptance is not recorded until acceptance is received. Royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded when earned. Service revenue received in advance from service
contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the service contract. Revenue received in advance from rental unit contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract. Revenue from
rental unit contracts is recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract. Revenue from sale of marketing and distribution rights is initially deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the life of the contract. Freight charges billed to
customers are included in revenue. All freight-related expenses are charged to cost of sales.

We do not recognize revenues to the extent that we offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products or
similarly offer variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities. However, as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders, one time special pricing to support new product introductions, sales rebates for
centralized purchasing entities or price-breaks for regular order volumes. The costs of all such programs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue. Our products are predominantly therapy-based equipment and require no installation. As such, we have
no significant installation obligations.

(7)    Stock-Based Compensation. We measure the compensation of all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant.
Such value is recognized as compensation expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock
price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk-free interest
rate assumption we use is based upon U.S. Treasury yield curve appropriate for the expected life of the awards. Expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable
options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options. We use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends. In order to
determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we have used historical rates by employee groups. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual
results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective
estimates and changes to

- 45 -


these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense we record to vary.

(8)    Income Tax. We assess our income
tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not
that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant
information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2009, the FASB amended the authoritative
guidance on revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements that include software elements. This new guidance permits prospective or retrospective adoption. We will prospectively adopt this guidance from July 1,
2010 and do not believe it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair-value
measurements including significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair-value measurements and information on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair-value measurements. The
FASB also clarified existing fair-value measurement disclosure guidance about the level of disaggregation, inputs, and valuation techniques. The guidance related to the Level 3 reconciliation will be effective for the Company beginning July 1,
2011. The remaining guidance has been adopted and the impact was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements and financial disclosures.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of June 30, 2010, we are not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of
Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.

Foreign Currency Market Risk

Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, although the financial statements of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are maintained in their
respective local currencies. We transact business in various foreign currencies, including a number of major European currencies as well as the Australian dollar. We have significant foreign currency exposure through both our Australian and
Singapore manufacturing activities and international sales operations. We have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased currency options and forward contracts to hedge foreign-currency-denominated financial assets, liabilities
and manufacturing expenditures. The goal of this hedging program is to economically manage the financial impact of foreign currency exposures denominated in Euros and Australian dollars. Under this program, increases or decreases in our
foreign-currency-denominated financial assets, liabilities, and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The foreign
currency derivatives portfolio is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and included in other assets or other liabilities. All movements in the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives are recorded within other income, net
on our consolidated statements of income.

The table below provides information (in U.S. dollars) on our foreign-currency-denominated
financial assets by legal entity functional currency as of June 30, 2010 (in thousands):

The table below provides information about our foreign currency derivative financial
instruments and presents the information in U.S. dollar equivalents. The table summarizes information on instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates, including foreign currency call options held at
June 30, 2010. The table presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by contractual maturity dates for our foreign currency derivative financial instruments. These notional amounts generally are used to calculate payments
to be exchanged under the options contracts.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to risk associated with changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents and debt. At
June 30, 2010, we had total long-term debt, including the current portion of those obligations, of $121.7 million. All of this debt is subject to variable interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during the year ended
June 30, 2010, would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations. We have no interest rate hedging agreements.

Credit Market Risk

At June 30, 2010, we held a number of investment securities in AAA rated auction securities with UBS Financial Services Inc.
(“UBS”). During November 2008, we accepted an offer that gave us a right to sell our investment securities back to UBS at full par value after June 29, 2010. In accordance with the agreement reached with UBS during November 2008 we
sold our securities back to UBS at full par value on June 30, 2010. We have recognized the full par value of the securities within Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required

disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
June 30, 2010. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2010.

There has been no change in our internal controls over
financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

EPORTING

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that:

(i)

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

(ii)

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

(iii)

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2010. Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “Internal Control – Integrated
Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of ResMed Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the
operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Based on our assessment and those criteria, management has
concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2010.

KPMG LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of ResMed, Inc.
included in this report, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

ResMed Inc.:

We have audited ResMed Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). ResMed Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, ResMed Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of ResMed Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2010, and the related financial statement schedule, and our report dated August 16, 2010
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.

ResMed Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ResMed Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2010 and 2009, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2010. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule II. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ResMed Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended June 30, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), ResMed Inc.’s internal
control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated
August 16, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1)

Organization and Basis of Presentation

ResMed Inc. (referred to herein as “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation
formed in March 1994 as a holding company for the ResMed Group. Through our subsidiaries, we design, manufacture and market equipment for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing and other respiratory disorders, including
obstructive sleep apnea. Our manufacturing operations are located in Australia, Singapore, France and the United States. Major distribution and sales sites are located in the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Switzerland,
Australia, Norway and Sweden.

(2)

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from management’s estimates.

(b)

Revenue Recognition

Revenue on product sales is generally recorded upon shipment, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the customer. Revenue on
product sales which require customer acceptance is not recorded until acceptance is received. Royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded when earned. Service revenue received in advance from service contracts is initially deferred and
recognized ratably over the life of the service contract. Revenue received in advance from rental unit contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract. Revenue from rental unit contracts is recognized
ratably over the life of the rental contract. Revenue from sale of marketing or distribution rights is initially deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the life of the contract. Freight charges billed to customers are included in revenue.
All shipping and handling related expenses are charged to cost of sales. Taxes assessed by government authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions, such as sales and value added taxes, are reported on a net
basis (excluded from revenue).

We do not
recognize revenues to the extent that we offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products, other than returns for product defects or other warranty claims, nor do we recognize revenues if we offer variable sale
prices for subsequent events or activities. However, as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders, one time special pricing to support new product introductions, sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities
or price-breaks for regular order volumes. The costs of all such programs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue. Our products are predominantly therapy-based equipment and require no installation. As such, we have no significant installation
obligations.

(c)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents include certificates of deposit and other highly liquid investments and are stated at cost, which approximates market.
Investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are considered to be cash equivalents for purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued

(d)

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined principally by the first-in, first-out method, or net realizable value. Finished
goods and work-in-process inventories include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs. We review and provide for any product obsolescence in our manufacturing and distribution operations with assessments of individual products and
components (based on estimated future usage and sales) being performed throughout the year.

(e)

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment, including rental equipment, is recorded at cost. Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to ten years except for buildings which are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 40 years and leasehold improvements which are amortized over the lease term. Maintenance and
repairs are charged to expense as incurred.

We
capitalize interest in connection with the construction of facilities. Actual construction costs incurred relating to facilities under active development qualify for interest capitalization. Interest capitalization ceases when the construction of a
facility is complete and available for use. During the years ended June 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we capitalized $Nil, $1.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of interest relating to such construction costs.

(f)

Intangible Assets

The registration costs for new patents are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the patent, generally five years.
In the event of a patent being superseded or product retirement, the unamortized costs are written off immediately.

Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to nine years. We
evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. All of our intangible assets are subject to
amortization. No impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented.

(g)

Goodwill

We conducted our annual review for goodwill impairment during the final quarter of fiscal 2010. In conducting our review of goodwill
impairment, we identified reporting units, being components of our operating segment, as each of the entities acquired and giving rise to the goodwill. The fair value for each reporting unit was determined based on estimated discounted cash flows.
Our goodwill impairment review involved a two-step process as follows:

Step 1-

Compare the fair value for each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. For each reporting unit where the carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds the
reporting unit’s fair value, move on to step 2. If a reporting unit’s fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is performed and no impairment charge is
necessary.

AND

S

UBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(2)

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued

Step 2-

Allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non-goodwill intangible assets and liabilities. This will derive an implied fair value for the
goodwill. Then, compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value
of its goodwill, an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess.

The results of Step 1 of our annual review indicated that no impaired goodwill exists.

(h)

Foreign Currency

The consolidated financial statements of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, whose functional currencies are other than U.S. dollars, are
translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated at period end exchange rates, and revenue and expense
transactions are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are recognized as part of comprehensive income, as detailed in Note 6, and are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the
consolidated balance sheets until such time as the subsidiary is sold or substantially or completely liquidated. Gains and losses on transactions denominated in other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in operations.

(i)

Research and Development

All research and development costs are expensed in the period incurred.

(j)

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, the denominator includes both the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and the number of dilutive common stock equivalents such as stock
options and restricted stock units.

The weighted
average shares used to calculate basic earnings per share were 75,454,000, 75,629,000 and 77,378,000 for the years ended June 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The difference between basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share
is attributable to the impact of outstanding stock options and restricted stock units during the periods presented. Stock options and restricted stock units had the effect of increasing the number of shares used in the calculation (by application of
the treasury stock method) by 2,095,000, 1,484,000 and 1,334,000 for the years ended June 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The weighted average number of outstanding stock options and restricted stock units not included in the computation of diluted earnings
per share were 498,000, 7,502,000 and 4,944,000 for the years ended June 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued

Basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended June 30, 2010, 2009 and
2008 are calculated as follows (in thousands except per share data):

(k)

Financial Instruments

The carrying value of financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate
their fair value because of their short-term nature. The carrying value of long-term debt approximates the fair value as the principal amounts outstanding are subject to variable interest rates that are based on market rates which are regularly
reset. Foreign currency option contracts are marked to market and therefore reflect their fair value. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

The fair value of financial instruments is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

(l)

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

We enter into various types of foreign exchange contracts in managing our foreign exchange risk, including derivative financial
instruments encompassing forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options.

The purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect us from adverse exchange rate fluctuations with respect to net cash
movements resulting from the sales of products to foreign customers and Australian manufacturing activities. We enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated sales and manufacturing costs, principally denominated in Australian
dollars, Euros and Pounds. The terms of such foreign currency option contracts generally do not exceed three years.

Our foreign currency derivatives portfolio represents a cash flow hedge program against the net cash flow of our international
manufacturing operations. We have determined our hedge program to be a non-effective hedge. The foreign currency derivatives portfolio is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and included in other assets. Purchases of foreign
currency derivatives and proceeds received from the exercise of foreign currency derivatives are classified as an Investing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued

All movements in the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives are recorded within
other income, net in our consolidated statements of income.

(m)

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date.

(n)

Investment Securities

Management determines the appropriate classification of our investments in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and
re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. Debt securities for which we do not have the intent or ability to hold to maturity are classified as available-for-sale. Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with the
unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive income.

At June 30, 2010 and 2009, the investments in debt securities were classified on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets within
prepaid expenses and other current assets and investment securities, respectively.

(o)

Warranty

Estimated future warranty costs related to certain products are charged to operations in the period in which the related revenue is
recognized. The liability for warranty costs are included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets.

Changes in the liability for product warranty for the year ended June 30, 2010 are as follows (in thousands):

(p)

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used, including certain identifiable intangible assets,
when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison

of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

The aggregate carrying amount of our cost-method investments at June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009 was $1.7 million and $2.2
million, respectively. We review the carrying value of these investments at each balance sheet date. In fiscal 2010 and 2009, we recognized $0.3 million and $1.3 million, respectively, of impairment losses related to our cost-method investments,
which include investments in privately held service companies, research companies and public companies. The expense associated with this impairment has been included in the other income, net line within the consolidated statements of income. These
were based on the determination that the declines in the fair value of these investments were other-than temporary. We have determined, subsequent to the impairment charge, that the fair value of our remaining investments exceed their carrying
values.

Stock-based Employee Compensation

We have granted stock options and restricted stock units to personnel, including officers and directors, under the ResMed Inc. 2009
Incentive Award Plan (the “2009 Plan”), the 2006 Incentive Award Plan, as amended (the “2006 Plan”) and the Amended and Restated ResMed Inc. 2006 Incentive Award Plan (the “2006 Amended Plan”). These options and
restricted stock units have expiration dates of seven years from the date of grant and vest over one or four years. We granted the options with the exercise price equal to the market value as determined at the date of grant. We have also offered to
our personnel, including officers, the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount under the ResMed Inc. 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”).

We measure the compensation expense of all stock-based
awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize the compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Such value is recognized as
expense over the service period, using the straight-line method for stock-based awards. The fair value of restricted stock units is equal to the market value of the underlying shares as determined at the date of grant.

The fair value of stock options granted under our stock
option plans and purchase rights granted under the ESPP is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model assuming no dividends and using the following assumptions:

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued

Expected volatilities are based on a combination of
historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options. We use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the addition of the implied
volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends. While there is a tradeable market of options on our common stock less emphasis is placed on the implied volatility of these options due to the relative low volumes of these traded
options and the difference in the terms compared to our employee options. The expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our
historical exercise patterns. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option.

(s)

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required
payments, which results in bad debt expense. We determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables, considering a customer’s financial condition, credit history and current economic conditions.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2009, the FASB amended the authoritative guidance on revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables and
arrangements that include software elements. This new guidance permits prospective or retrospective adoption. We will prospectively adopt this guidance from July 1, 2010 and do not believe it will have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

In January 2010, the FASB
issued authoritative guidance requiring new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair-value measurements including significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair-value measurements and information on purchases, sales,
issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair-value measurements. The FASB also clarified existing fair-value measurement disclosure guidance about the level of disaggregation, inputs, and valuation techniques.
The disclosure requirements related to the Level 3 reconciliation will be effective July 1, 2011. The remaining guidance has been adopted and the impact was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements and financial
disclosures.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended June 30, 2010, were as follows:

On October 1, 2009, we acquired 100% of the outstanding
shares of Laboratoires Narval SA. Based in France, Laboratoires Narval manufactures and distributes a mandibular repositioning device (“MRD”) that offers a solution to patients for snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (“OSA”),
especially for those with mild OSA. With this acquisition, we add another therapy to supplement our existing positive airway pressure-based solutions, providing a broader offering for this patient group. The total purchase price was EUR
8 million in cash with potential contingent consideration cash payments of EUR 2 million based on the achievement of certain revenue milestones. In relation to the potential contingent consideration, we have recognized a liability of EUR
1.4 million, which is based on the expectation that 70% of the revenue milestones will be achieved. The acquisition is not considered a material business combination. The acquisition of Laboratoires Narval has been accounted for using purchase
accounting and is included in our consolidated financial statements from October 1, 2009. We have not incurred any material acquisition-related costs in connection with the acquisition of Laboratoires Narval.

Long-term Debt, Continued

2006 Second Amended and Restated Revolving Loan Agreement (“the Loan Agreement”) with Union Bank, N.A (formerly Union Bank of California, N.A). The Loan Agreement was modified in order
that the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio was revised to exclude all indebtedness owing to Union Bank, N.A.

The entire outstanding principal amount must be repaid in full before March 1, 2011. The outstanding principal amount due under the
revolving facility will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.75% to 1.00% (depending on the applicable leverage ratio). At June 30, 2010, there was $64.1 million outstanding under this revolving facility, which was bearing interest at
a rate of approximately 1.1%.

The
obligations of ResMed Corp., ResMed Motor Technologies Inc. and ResMed EAP Holdings Inc. under the Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of the personal property of each of ResMed Corp., ResMed Motor Technologies Inc. and ResMed EAP
Holdings Inc., and are guaranteed by ResMed Inc. under an Amended and Restated Continuing Guaranty and Pledge Agreement, which guaranty is secured by a pledge of the equity interests in ResMed Corp., ResMed Motor Technologies Inc. and ResMed EAP
Holdings Inc. held by ResMed Inc. The Loan Agreement also contains customary covenants, including certain financial covenants and an obligation that ResMed Inc. maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as
defined in the Loan Agreement), a fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum tangible net worth, and a minimum ResMed Corp., ResMed Motor Technologies Inc. and ResMed EAP Holdings Inc. EBITDA.

The entire principal amount of the revolving facility and
any accrued but unpaid interest may be declared immediately due and payable in the event of the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the Loan Agreement. Events of default include, among other items, failure to make payments when due, the
occurrence of a material default in the performance of any covenants in the Loan Agreement or related amendments or a 35% or more change in control of ResMed Inc., ResMed Corp., ResMed Motor Technologies Inc. or ResMed EAP Holdings Inc. At
June 30, 2010, we were in compliance with our debt covenants.

Syndicated Facility

On June 8, 2006, our wholly owned Australian subsidiary, ResMed Limited, entered into a Syndicated Facility Agreement with HSBC Bank
Australia Limited as original financier, facility agent and security trustee, that provides for a loan in three tranches (the “Syndicated Facility Agreement”).

Tranche A is a Euro (“EUR”) 50 million five-year term loan facility that refinanced all amounts outstanding
under a previous facility. Tranche A bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR for outstanding principal amounts denominated in EUR plus a margin of 0.80% or 0.90%, depending on the ratio of the total debt to EBITDA of ResMed Inc. and its subsidiaries
(the “ResMed Group”) for the most recently completed fiscal year for the applicable interest period. The total outstanding principal amount of Tranche A must be repaid in full on June 8, 2011. At June 30, 2010, the Tranche A
facility loan had an amount outstanding of EUR 15.0 million, equivalent to approximately U.S. dollars (“USD”) 18.4 million, which was bearing interest at a rate of approximately 1.2%.

Tranche B is a USD 15 million term loan facility that
may only be used for the purpose of financing capital expenditures and other asset acquisitions by the ResMed Group. Tranche B bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR for outstanding principal amounts denominated in EUR, Australian dollars, USD or
British Pounds Sterling plus a margin of 0.80% or 0.90%, depending on the ratio of the total debt to EBITDA of the ResMed Group for the most recently completed fiscal year for the applicable interest period. The entire principal amount must be
repaid in full on June 8, 2011. At June 30, 2010 there was USD 9.0 million outstanding under the Tranche B loan facility, which was bearing interest at a rate of approximately 1.1%.

Long-term Debt, Continued

Tranche C was a USD 60 million term loan facility that could only be used for the
purpose of the payment by ResMed Limited of a dividend to ResMed Holdings Limited, which would ultimately be paid to ResMed Inc. Tranche C bore interest at a rate equal to LIBOR for deposits denominated in EUR, Australian dollars or USD plus a
margin of 0.70% or 0.80%, depending on the ratio of the total debt to EBITDA of the ResMed Group for the most recently completed fiscal year for the applicable interest period. The entire outstanding principal amount was repaid in full during the
year ended June 30, 2009. At June 30, 2010, the Tranche C loan facility was no longer available.

Simultaneous with the Syndicated Facility Agreement, ResMed Limited entered into a working capital agreement with HSBC Bank Australia
Limited for revolving, letter of credit and overdraft facilities up to a total commitment of 6.5 million Australian dollars, and ResMed (UK) Limited entered into a working capital agreement with HSBC Bank plc for a revolving cash advance
facility for a total commitment of up to 3 million British Pounds Sterling. At June 30, 2010, there were no amounts outstanding under either of these facilities.

On September 30, 2008, our wholly-owned Australian
subsidiary, ResMed Limited, agreed to amend and restate the Syndicated Facility Agreement entered into on June 8, 2006. The amended and restated agreement (“First Amended and Restated Syndicated Facility Agreement”) with the Hong Kong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Sydney Branch as financier and HSBC Bank Australia Limited as facility agent and security trustee, provided for an additional Tranche D term loan facility in the amount of USD 50 million.

On September 30, 2009, ResMed Limited, agreed to amend
and restate for a second time the Syndicated Facility Agreement. The second amended and restated agreement (“Second Amended and Restated Syndicated Facility Agreement”) provides for the extension of our Tranche D term loan facility in the
amount of USD 50 million for an additional 12 month period and to increase the interest rate applicable to the Tranche D portion of the loan facility. The financier continues to have the right to assign part or all of its rights and/or
obligations under the Second Amended and Restated Syndicated Facility Agreement to other financial institutions. The extended Tranche D loan facility bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR for outstanding principal amounts denominated in USD, plus
a margin of 2.25% or 2.50%, depending on the ratio of the total debt to EBITDA of the ResMed Group for the most recently completed fiscal year for the applicable interest period. The entire principal amount of the additional loan facility must be
repaid in full by September 30, 2010. At June 30, 2010, there was USD 30.0 million outstanding under the Tranche D loan facility, which was bearing interest at a rate of approximately 2.6%.

The Syndicated Facility Agreement is secured by a pledge of
one hundred percent of the shares of ResMed Inc.’s subsidiary, ResMed Paris SAS (formerly Saime SAS), pursuant to a pledge agreement. The Syndicated Facility Agreement also contains customary covenants, including certain financial covenants and
an obligation that ResMed Limited maintains certain financial ratios, including a minimum debt service cover ratio, a maximum ratio of total debt to EBITDA and a minimum tangible net worth. The entire principal amount of the loan and any accrued,
but unpaid, interest may be declared immediately due and payable in the event of the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the Syndicated Facility Agreement. Events of default include, among other items, failure to make payments when due,
breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, the occurrence of certain insolvency events, the occurrence of an event or change which could have a material adverse effect on ResMed Limited and its subsidiaries, and if ResMed Inc. ceases to
control ResMed Limited, ResMed Corp., ResMed SAS, ResMed GmbH & Co. KG, ResMed (UK) Limited, Take Air Medical Handels-GmbH or ResMed Paris SAS.

During fiscal years 2010 and 2009, we repurchased 2,519,843 and 1,826,307 shares at a
cost of $135.8 million and $65.7 million, respectively. At June 30, 2010, we have repurchased a total of 9.2 million shares at a cost of $344.5 million, of which 6.6 million shares were repurchased pursuant to the repurchase program
approved on June 6, 2002 and 2.6 million were repurchased pursuant to the new repurchase program approved on May 27, 2009. Shares that are repurchased are classified as treasury stock pending future use and reduce the number of shares
outstanding used in calculating earnings per share. At June 30, 2010, there is a remaining 7.4 million shares that can be repurchased under the approved share repurchase program.

Stock Split.

On August 5,
2010, our Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split of our common stock to be payable in the form of a 100% stock dividend. Shareholders will receive one additional share of common stock for every share held on August 17, 2010. Common
stock issued and outstanding, giving retroactive effect to the stock split at June 30, 2010 would have been 151.3 million. Pro forma earnings per share, giving retroactive effect to the stock split, is as follows (in millions, except for
per share information):

Preferred Stock.

In April
1997, the Board of Directors authorized 2,000,000 shares of $0.01 par value preferred stock. No such shares were issued or outstanding at June 30, 2010.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).

The ESPP was approved at the annual meeting of the
stockholders of ResMed Inc. on November 18, 2009, as an amendment to the previously approved employee stock purchase plan. Under the ESPP, participants are offered the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount during successive
offering periods. Each offering period under the ESPP will be for a period of time determined by the Board of Directors’ Compensation Committee of no less than 3 months and no more than 27 months. The purchase price for our common stock under
the ESPP will be the lower of 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant or 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of purchase. An individual participant cannot subscribe for more than $25,000 in
common stock during any calendar year. As part of the approval of the ESPP at the annual meeting of the stockholders of ResMed Inc. on November 18, 2009, the number of shares of our common stock available for grant under the ESPP increased by
600,000 shares, from 500,000 shares to 1,100,000 shares. The number of securities remaining available for future issuance under the ESPP at June 30, 2010 is 540,000. During fiscal year 2010, we issued 162,000 shares to our employees in two
offerings and we recognized $1.9 million of stock compensation expense associated with the ESPP.

Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units (“RSU’s”).

We have granted stock options and
RSU’s to personnel, including officers and directors, in accordance with the 2006 Plan, the 2006 Amended Plan and the 2009 Plan, which was approved at the annual meeting of the stockholders of ResMed Inc. on November 18, 2009. These

Income Taxes, Continued

At June 30, 2010, we had $6,487,000 of U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and
$9,372,000 of non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, which expire in various years through 2023 or carry forward indefinitely. We also have foreign tax credit carryforwards of $3,055,000. The foreign tax credit carryforwards have expiration
dates through 2020.

The valuation allowance at
June 30, 2010 relates to a provision for uncertainty as to the utilization of foreign tax credits of $3,055,000, net operating loss carryforwards for certain non-U.S. countries of $1,562,000 and capital loss items of $542,000. We believe that
it is more likely than not that the benefits of deferred tax assets, net of any valuation allowance, will be realized.

We have not provided for U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries indefinitely
invested outside the United States as of June 30, 2010. The total amount of these undistributed earnings at June 30, 2010 amounted to approximately $667 million. Should we repatriate foreign earnings, we would have to adjust the income tax
provision in the period management determined that we would repatriate earnings.

In accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only
if management’s assessment is that the position is “more likely than not” (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term “tax
position” refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for annual periods.

The following table indicates the changes to our
unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009. The term “unrecognized tax benefits”, UTB, refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the
benefit measured and recognized in the consolidated financial statements.

Included in the balance at June 30, 2010, are tax
positions of $1.4 million that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. Also included in the balance is $1.2 million of temporary differences, for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty
about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.

For fiscal year ending June 30, 2010, the Company recognized a benefit of $0.1 million ($0.1 million, net of tax benefit) of interest
and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of June 30, 2010, we have accrued approximately $0.8 million ($0.5 million net of tax benefit) for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

Income Taxes, Continued

We file numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S. federal
jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examination for tax years prior to fiscal year 2006, and no longer subject to state income tax examinations for the tax years prior to
fiscal year 2005. With few exceptions, including the German tax assessment, we are no longer subject to foreign income tax examinations for fiscal years before 2003. During September and October 2004, we began receiving tax assessment notices for
the audit of one of our German subsidiaries by the German tax authorities for the years 1996 through 1998. Certain aspects of these assessment notices are being contested and appealed to the German tax authority office. As the outcome of the appeal
cannot be predicted with certainty, any tax issues resolved in a manner not consistent with our expectations may require us to adjust our provision for income tax in the period of resolution.

Within the next 12 months, we anticipate a potential
decrease of approximately $1.4 million in the unrecognized tax benefit due to statute of limitations expiration relating to the timing of certain amortization deductions of $0.8 million and $0.6 million for other items. These potential decreases
will potentially impact the effective tax rate by $0.6 million, which includes the potential reduction in accrued interest. We do not anticipate any other significant changes within the next 12 months.

Segment Information

The Company operates solely in the sleep-disordered breathing sector of the respiratory medicine industry. The Company therefore believes
that, given the single market focus of its operations and the inter-dependence of its products, the Company operates as a single operating segment. The Company assesses performance and allocates resources on the basis of a single operating entity.

Sales of flow generators for the years ended
June 30, 2010, June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008 were $633.6 million, $532.1 million and $484.4 million, respectively. Sales of mask systems, motors and other accessories for the years ended June 30, 2010, June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008 were
$458.8 million, $388.6 million and $351.2 million, respectively.

Financial information by geographic area for the years ended June 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, is summarized below (in thousands):

Net revenues from external customers are based on the
location of the customer. Long-lived assets of geographic areas are those assets used in the Company’s operations in each geographical area and excludes intangibles, deferred tax assets and goodwill.

(17)

Commitments

The Company leases buildings, motor vehicles and office equipment under operating leases. Rental charges for operating leases are expensed
on a straight-line basis over the lease term taking into account rent concessions or holidays. Rent expenses under operating leases for the years ended June 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $10.2 million, $14.9 million and $9.1
million, respectively. At June 30, 2010 the Company had the following future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases (in thousands):

Legal Actions and Contingencies

In the normal course of business, we are subject to routine litigation incidental to our business. While the results of this litigation
cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that their final outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

During September and October 2004, we began receiving tax assessment notices for the audit of one of our German subsidiaries
by the German tax authorities for the years 1996 through 1998. Certain aspects of these assessment notices are being contested and appealed to the German tax authority office. As the outcome of the appeal cannot be predicted with certainty, any tax
issues resolved in a manner not consistent with our expectations may require us to adjust our provision for income tax in the period of resolution.

In February 2007, the University of Sydney commenced legal action in the Federal Court of Australia against us, claiming breach of a
license agreement and infringement of certain intellectual property. The claim has been amended to include an allegation of breach of confidentiality. The university is seeking various types of relief, including an injunction against manufacturing,
supplying, offering for sale, selling or exporting certain mask devices, payment of license fees, damages or an account of profits, interest, costs and declaration of a constructive trust over and assignment of certain intellectual property. In
October 2007, we filed a defense denying the university’s claim, as well as a cross-claim against the university seeking an order for rectification of the contract and alleging the university violated the Australian Trade Practices Act. The
matter is ongoing. We have not recognized a liability in relation to this matter at June 30, 2010 and we do not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Legal Actions and Contingencies, Continued

In January 2010, Vaughn Medical Equipment Repair Service, L.L.C., filed a complaint in
the U.S. District court in Louisiana, against us and other defendants, alleging, among other things, anti-competitive conduct, conspiracy, defamation and tortious interference. We have filed our initial response to the suit, asking the
court to dismiss the case. We do not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Voluntary Product Recall Expenses

On April 23, 2007, we initiated a worldwide voluntary recall of approximately 300,000 units of our early production S8 flow
generators used for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. In S8 devices manufactured between July 2004 and May 15, 2006, there is a remote potential for a short circuit in the power supply connector. The initial estimated cost of this
action was $59.7 million which was recognized as a charge to cost of sales in the consolidated statement of income year ended June 30, 2007. During the years ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009, we recognized $Nil additional
charges, respectively. These costs represented our best estimate of probable costs based on available data and accounted for factors such as expected return rates for the affected units, unit replacement costs, legal, consulting, logistical and
temporary contractor expenses directly associated with the recall. We expect negligible additional costs associated with the recall and at June 30, 2010 there is no remaining recall accrual.

Following is a summary of the liabilities related to the
voluntary product recall that were recorded during the years ended June 30, 2008, June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2010 (in thousands):

Fair Value Measurements

In determining the fair value measurements of our financial assets and liabilities, we consider the principal and most advantageous market
in which we transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the financial asset or liability. We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The
hierarchies of inputs used to determine fair value are as follows:

Fair Value Measurements, Continued

•    Level 3:

Input prices quoted that are significant to the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities which are not observable nor supported by an active market

The following table summarizes our financial assets and
liabilities at June 30, 2010 using the valuation input hierarchy (in thousands):

The following table summarizes our financial assets and
liabilities at June 30, 2009 using the valuation input hierarchy (in thousands):

We determine the fair value of our financial assets as
follows:

Cash and cash equivalents - The
valuation used for our cash, short-term deposits and other money market funds are based on the amounts invested due to their short term nature and there is an active market for these financial instruments.

Investment securities - These securities represent our
auction rate securities as described in Note 4. At June 30, 2010, we held a number of investment securities in AAA rated auction securities with UBS. During November 2008, we accepted an offer that gave us a right to sell our investment
securities back to UBS at full par value after June 29, 2010. In accordance with the agreement reached with UBS, we sold our securities back to UBS at full par value on June 30, 2010. We have recognized the full par value amount of the
securities within Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets. At June 30, 2009, we had investments totaling $5.0 million at par value with an estimated fair value of $4.3 million. The value of these securities are calculated by third party
valuation models based on observable market prices and inputs including future cash flows, yields and spreads.

Cost-method investments - These investments include our holdings in privately held service companies and research companies that are not
exchange traded and, therefore, are not supported with observable market prices. However, these investments are valued by reference to their net asset values which can be market supported and observable inputs including future cash flows.

Foreign currency options - These financial
instruments are valued using third party valuation models based on market observable inputs, including interest rate curves, on market spot currency prices, volatilities and credit risk.

Fair Value Measurements, Continued

The following table shows a reconciliation of the year ended June 30, 2010 for fair
value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (thousands):

We did not have any significant non-financial assets or
liabilities measured at fair value on June 30, 2010 or 2009.

Subsequent Events

On August 5, 2010 we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a two-for-one split of its common stock, payable in the form
of a 100 percent stock dividend. Shareholders of record will receive one additional share of common stock for every share held on August 17, 2010.

(22)

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We transact business in various foreign currencies, including a number of major European currencies as well as the Australian dollar. We
have significant foreign currency exposure through both our Australian manufacturing activities and international sales operations. We have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased currency options and forward contracts to
hedge foreign-currency-denominated financial assets, liabilities and manufacturing expenditures. The terms of such foreign currency hedging contracts generally do not exceed three years. The goal of this hedging program is to economically manage the
financial impact of foreign currency exposures denominated in Euros, Australian dollars and British Pounds. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated financial assets, liabilities, and firm commitments are
partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments.

We do not designate these foreign currency contracts as hedges. All movements in the fair value of the foreign currency instruments are
recorded within other income, net in our consolidated statements of income. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

We held foreign currency instruments with notional amounts totaling $211.5 million and $191.7 million at June 30, 2010 and
June 30, 2009, respectively, to hedge foreign currency fluctuations. These contracts mature at various dates prior to June 30, 2013.

The fair value and effect of derivative instruments on our consolidated financial statements were as follows:

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, Continued

We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counter
parties to financial instruments. The credit exposure of foreign currency derivatives at June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009 was $10.8 million and $7.8 million, respectively, which represents the positive fair value of our foreign currency
derivatives. These values are included in the current and non-current balances of other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. We minimize counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative transactions with major financial institutions and,
as such, we do not expect material losses as a result of default by our counterparties.
