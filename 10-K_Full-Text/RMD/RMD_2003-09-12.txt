ITEM  1     BUSINESS

GENERAL

WE  ARE  A  LEADING DEVELOPER, MANUFACTURER AND DISTRIBUTOR OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT
FOR  TREATING, DIAGNOSING, AND MANAGING SLEEP DISORDERED BREATHING, OR SDB.  SDB
INCLUDES  OBSTRUCTIVE  SLEEP APNEA, OR OSA, AND OTHER RESPIRATORY DISORDERS THAT
OCCUR  DURING  SLEEP.  WHEN  WE  WERE FORMED IN 1989, OUR PRIMARY PURPOSE WAS TO
COMMERCIALIZE  A  TREATMENT  FOR OSA DEVELOPED BY PROFESSOR COLIN SULLIVAN. THIS
TREATMENT,  NASAL  CONTINUOUS  POSITIVE  AIRWAY PRESSURE, OR CPAP, WAS THE FIRST
SUCCESSFUL  NONINVASIVE TREATMENT FOR OSA. CPAP SYSTEMS DELIVER PRESSURIZED AIR,
TYPICALLY  THROUGH  A NASAL MASK, TO PREVENT COLLAPSE OF THE UPPER AIRWAY DURING
SLEEP.

SINCE  THE  DEVELOPMENT  OF NASAL CPAP, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A NUMBER OF INNOVATIVE
PRODUCTS  FOR  SDB,  INCLUDING  AIRFLOW  GENERATORS,  DIAGNOSTIC  PRODUCTS, MASK
SYSTEMS,  HEADGEAR  AND  OTHER  ACCESSORIES.  OUR  GROWTH  HAS  BEEN  FUELLED BY
GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION, INCREASED AWARENESS OF SDB AS A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CONCERN
AMONG  PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS, AND OUR RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORT.

WE  EMPLOY  1,464  PEOPLE  AND  SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN OVER 60 COUNTRIES THROUGH A
COMBINATION  OF  WHOLLY  OWNED  SUBSIDIARIES  AND  INDEPENDENT  DISTRIBUTORS.

OUR  WEB SITE ADDRESS IS WWW.RESMED.COM.  WE MAKE OUR PERIODIC REPORTS, TOGETHER
WITH  ANY  AMENDMENTS,  AVAILABLE  ON  OUR  WEB SITE, FREE OF CHARGE, AS SOON AS
REASONABLY  PRACTICABLE AFTER WE ELECTRONICALLY FILE OR FURNISH THE REPORTS WITH
THE  SECURITIES  AND  EXCHANGE  COMMISSION.


CORPORATE  HISTORY

RESMED  INC.,  A  DELAWARE CORPORATION, WAS FORMED IN MARCH 1994 AS THE ULTIMATE
HOLDING  COMPANY  FOR  OUR  DOMESTIC,  AUSTRALIAN  AND  EUROPEAN  OPERATING
SUBSIDIARIES.  ON  JUNE  1,  1995,  WE  COMPLETED  AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF
COMMON  STOCK  AND  ON  JUNE  2,  1995 OUR COMMON STOCK COMMENCED TRADING ON THE
NASDAQ  NATIONAL  MARKET.  ON  SEPTEMBER  30,  1999 WE TRANSFERRED OUR PRINCIPAL
PUBLIC  LISTING  TO THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (NYSE), TRADING UNDER THE TICKER
SYMBOL  RMD.  ON  NOVEMBER  25,  1999, WE ESTABLISHED A SECONDARY LISTING OF OUR
SHARES  VIA  CHESS  DEPOSITARY  INSTRUMENTS,  OR  CDIS,  ON THE AUSTRALIAN STOCK
EXCHANGE  (ASX),  ALSO  UNDER THE SYMBOL RMD.  TEN CDIS ON THE ASX REPRESENT ONE
SHARE  OF  OUR  COMMON STOCK ON THE NYSE.  ON JULY 1, 2002, WE CONVERTED OUR ASX
LISTING  STATUS  FROM  A  FOREIGN  EXEMPT  LISTING  TO  A  FULL  LISTING.

OUR  AUSTRALIAN SUBSIDIARY, RESMED HOLDINGS LIMITED, WAS ORIGINALLY ORGANIZED IN
1989 BY DR. PETER FARRELL TO ACQUIRE FROM BAXTER CENTER FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH PTY
LIMITED,  OR BAXTER, THE RIGHTS TO CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY RELATING TO CPAP TREATMENT
AS WELL AS BAXTER'S EXISTING CPAP DEVICE BUSINESS.  BAXTER HAD SOLD CPAP DEVICES
IN  AUSTRALIA  SINCE 1988, HAVING ACQUIRED THE RIGHTS TO THE TECHNOLOGY IN 1987.

SINCE  FORMATION  WE  HAVE  ACQUIRED  A NUMBER OF OPERATING BUSINESSES INCLUDING
SERVO MAGNETICS INC, LABHARDT AG, MAP MEDIZIN TECHNOLOGIE GMBH, DIETER W. PRIESS
MEDTECHNIK, PREMIUM MEDICAL SARL, INNOVMEDICS PTE LTD AND EINAR EGNELL AB ON MAY
14, 2002; NOVEMBER 15, 2001; FEBRUARY 16, 2001; FEBRUARY 7, 1996; JUNE 12, 1996;
NOVEMBER  1,  1997;  AND  JANUARY 31, 2000 RESPECTIVELY.  DURING THE 1999 FISCAL
YEAR  WE  MADE  AN  EQUITY  INVESTMENT  IN  MEDCARE FLAGA HF (MEDCARE), BASED IN
ICELAND.  WE  NOW MARKET MEDCARE'S POLYSOMNOGRAPHIC PRODUCTS UNDER THE EMBLA AND
EMBLETTA  LABEL  IN  SELECTED  COUNTRIES.

THE  MARKET

SLEEP IS A COMPLEX NEUROLOGICAL PROCESS THAT INCLUDES TWO DISTINCT STATES: RAPID
EYE  MOVEMENT,  OR REM, SLEEP AND NON-RAPID EYE MOVEMENT, OR NON-REM, SLEEP. REM
SLEEP,  WHICH  IS  ABOUT  20-25%  OF  TOTAL  SLEEP  EXPERIENCED  BY  ADULTS,  IS
CHARACTERIZED  BY  A HIGH LEVEL OF BRAIN ACTIVITY, BURSTS OF RAPID EYE MOVEMENT,
INCREASED  HEART  AND  RESPIRATION RATES, AND PARALYSIS OF MANY MUSCLES. NON-REM
SLEEP  IS SUBDIVIDED INTO FOUR STAGES THAT GENERALLY PARALLEL SLEEP DEPTH; STAGE
1  IS  THE  LIGHTEST  AND  STAGE  4  IS  THE  DEEPEST.

THE  UPPER AIRWAY HAS NO RIGID SUPPORT AND IS HELD OPEN BY ACTIVE CONTRACTION OF
UPPER  AIRWAY  MUSCLES.  NORMALLY, DURING REM SLEEP AND DEEPER LEVELS OF NON-REM
SLEEP,  UPPER  AIRWAY  MUSCLES  RELAX  AND  THE AIRWAY NARROWS. INDIVIDUALS WITH
NARROW UPPER AIRWAYS OR POOR MUSCLE TONE ARE PRONE TO TEMPORARY COLLAPSES OF THE
UPPER  AIRWAY DURING SLEEP, OR APNEAS, OR NEAR CLOSURES OF THE UPPER AIRWAYS, OR
HYPOPNEAS.  THESE  BREATHING IRREGULARITIES RESULT IN A LOWERING OF BLOOD OXYGEN
CONCENTRATION, CAUSING THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM TO REACT TO THE LACK OF OXYGEN
OR  INCREASED  CARBON  DIOXIDE AND SIGNALING THE BODY TO RESPOND. TYPICALLY, THE
INDIVIDUAL  SUBCONSCIOUSLY  AROUSES  FROM  SLEEP,  CAUSING THE THROAT MUSCLES TO
CONTRACT,  OPENING  THE AIRWAY. AFTER A FEW GASPING BREATHS, BLOOD OXYGEN LEVELS
INCREASE  AND  THE  INDIVIDUAL CAN RESUME A DEEPER SLEEP UNTIL THE CYCLE REPEATS
ITSELF.  SUFFERERS OF OSA TYPICALLY EXPERIENCE TEN OR MORE SUCH CYCLES PER HOUR.
WHILE  THESE  AWAKENINGS  GREATLY IMPAIR THE QUALITY OF SLEEP, THE INDIVIDUAL IS
NOT  NORMALLY  AWARE  OF  THESE DISRUPTIONS.  IN ADDITION, OSA HAS RECENTLY BEEN
RECOGNIZED  AS  A CAUSE OF HYPERTENSION AND A SIGNIFICANT CO-MORBIDITY FOR HEART
DISEASE,  STROKE  AND  DIABETES.  FOR  EXAMPLE, ONE RECENT RESEARCH STUDY SHOWED
THAT  83%  OF  AN  ADULT PATIENT POPULATION WITH DRUG-RESISTANT HYPERTENSION HAD
OSA.

IN ITS "WAKE UP AMERICA'' REPORT TO CONGRESS IN 1993, THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON
SLEEP  DISORDERS RESEARCH ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 40 MILLION INDIVIDUALS IN
THE  UNITED  STATES SUFFER FROM CHRONIC DISORDERS OF SLEEP AND WAKEFULNESS, SUCH
AS  SLEEP  APNEA, INSOMNIA AND NARCOLEPSY. ACCORDING TO THIS REPORT, SLEEP APNEA
IS  THE  MOST  COMMON  SLEEP  DISORDER,  AFFECTING  APPROXIMATELY  20  MILLION
INDIVIDUALS  IN THE UNITED STATES.  DESPITE THE HIGH PREVALENCE OF OSA, THERE IS
A  GENERAL  LACK  OF  AWARENESS  OF OSA AMONG BOTH THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY AND THE
GENERAL  PUBLIC.  IT  IS  ESTIMATED  THAT 10% OF THOSE AFFLICTED BY OSA KNOW THE
CAUSE OF THEIR EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS OR OTHER SYMPTOMS.  MANY HEALTH CARE
PROFESSIONALS  ARE  OFTEN  UNABLE  TO DIAGNOSE OSA BECAUSE THEY ARE UNAWARE THAT
SUCH  NON-SPECIFIC  SYMPTOMS  AS  EXCESSIVE  DAYTIME  SLEEPINESS,  SNORING,
HYPERTENSION  AND  IRRITABILITY  ARE  CHARACTERISTIC  OF  OSA.

WHILE  OSA  HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED IN A BROAD CROSS-SECTION OF THE POPULATION, IT IS
PREDOMINANT  AMONG  MIDDLE-AGED  MEN  AND  THOSE  WHO  ARE OBESE, SMOKE, CONSUME
ALCOHOL  IN  EXCESS OR USE MUSCLE-RELAXING AND PAIN-KILLING DRUGS.  IN ADDITION,
PATIENTS  WHO  ARE  BEING  TREATED FOR CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THOSE
UNDERGOING  DIALYSIS TREATMENT OR SUFFERING FROM DIABETES, MAY HAVE AN INCREASED
INCIDENCE  OF OSA.  RECENT STUDIES HAVE ALSO SHOWN THAT SDB IS PRESENT IN 45% OF
HYPERTENSION  PATIENTS  (INCLUDING  80%  OF  PATIENTS  WITH  DRUG-RESISTANT
HYPERTENSION),  60% OF STROKE PATIENTS AND 50% OF PATIENTS WITH CONGESTIVE HEART
FAILURE.


SLEEP-DISORDERED  BREATHING  AND  OBSTRUCTIVE  SLEEP  APNEA

SLEEP DISORDERED BREATHING, OR SDB, ENCOMPASSES ALL PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES THAT
CAUSE  DETRIMENTAL  BREATHING  PATTERNS  DURING  SLEEP.  MANIFESTATIONS  INCLUDE
OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA OR OSA, CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA, OR CSA, AND HYPOVENTILATION
SYNDROMES  THAT  OCCUR  DURING  SLEEP.  HYPOVENTILATION  SYNDROMES ARE GENERALLY
ASSOCIATED  WITH  OBESITY,  CHRONIC  OBSTRUCTIVE  LUNG DISEASE AND NEUROMUSCULAR
DISEASE.  OSA  IS  THE  MOST  COMMON  FORM  OF  SDB.

SLEEP FRAGMENTATION AND THE LOSS OF THE DEEPER LEVELS OF SLEEP CAUSED BY OSA CAN
LEAD  TO  EXCESSIVE  DAYTIME  SLEEPINESS,  REDUCED COGNITIVE FUNCTION, INCLUDING
MEMORY  LOSS  AND  LACK  OF  CONCENTRATION,  DEPRESSION  AND  IRRITABILITY.  OSA
SUFFERERS  ALSO  MAY  EXPERIENCE  AN  INCREASE IN HEART RATE AND AN ELEVATION OF
BLOOD  PRESSURE  DURING  THE CYCLE OF APNEAS.  SEVERAL STUDIES INDICATE THAT THE
OXYGEN  DESATURATION, INCREASED HEART RATE AND ELEVATED BLOOD PRESSURE CAUSED BY
OSA  MAY  BE  ASSOCIATED  WITH  INCREASED  RISK  OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORBIDITY AND
MORTALITY  DUE  TO  ANGINA, STROKE AND HEART ATTACK. PATIENTS WITH OSA HAVE BEEN
SHOWN  TO  HAVE IMPAIRED DAYTIME PERFORMANCE IN A VARIETY OF COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS
INCLUDING  PROBLEM  SOLVING,  RESPONSE  SPEED AND VISUAL MOTOR COORDINATION, AND
STUDIES  HAVE  LINKED  OSA  TO  INCREASED  OCCURRENCES  OF TRAFFIC AND WORKPLACE
ACCIDENTS.

GENERALLY,  AN  INDIVIDUAL SEEKING TREATMENT FOR THE SYMPTOMS OF OSA IS REFERRED
BY  A GENERAL PRACTITIONER TO A SPECIALIST FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. THE DIAGNOSIS
OF  OSA TYPICALLY REQUIRES MONITORING THE PATIENT DURING SLEEP AT EITHER A SLEEP
CLINIC  OR THE PATIENT'S HOME.  DURING OVERNIGHT TESTING, RESPIRATORY PARAMETERS
AND SLEEP PATTERNS ARE MONITORED ALONG WITH OTHER VITAL SIGNS SUCH AS HEART RATE
AND  BLOOD OXYGEN LEVELS. THESE TESTS ALLOW SLEEP CLINICIANS TO DETECT ANY SLEEP
DISTURBANCES  SUCH AS APNEAS, HYPOPNEAS OR SUBCONSCIOUS AWAKENINGS.  WE ESTIMATE
THAT  THERE  ARE CURRENTLY MORE THAN 2,500 SLEEP CLINICS IN THE UNITED STATES, A
SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF WHICH ARE AFFILIATED WITH HOSPITALS.  THE NUMBER OF SLEEP
CLINICS  HAS  EXPANDED  SIGNIFICANTLY  FROM APPROXIMATELY 100 SUCH FACILITIES IN
1985.

EXISTING  THERAPIES

PRIOR  TO  1981,  THE  PRIMARY  TREATMENT  FOR OSA WAS A TRACHEOTOMY, A SURGICAL
PROCEDURE  TO  CUT  A  HOLE  IN  THE  PATIENT'S WINDPIPE TO CREATE A CHANNEL FOR
AIRFLOW.  MOST  RECENTLY,  SURGERY HAS INVOLVED EITHER UVULOPALATOPHARYNGOPLASTY
('UPPP'),  IN  WHICH  SURGERY  IS PERFORMED ON THE UPPER AIRWAY TO REMOVE EXCESS
TISSUE  AND TO STREAMLINE THE SHAPE OF THE AIRWAY, OR MANDIBULAR ADVANCEMENT, IN
WHICH  THE LOWER JAW IS MOVED FORWARD TO WIDEN THE PATIENT'S AIRWAY.  UPPP ALONE
HAS A POOR SUCCESS RATE; HOWEVER, WHEN PERFORMED IN CONJUNCTION WITH MULTI-STAGE
UPPER  AIRWAY  SURGICAL  PROCEDURES,  A  GREATER  SUCCESS RATE HAS BEEN CLAIMED.
THESE  COMBINED  PROCEDURES,  PERFORMED  BY  HIGHLY  SPECIALIZED  SURGEONS,  ARE
EXPENSIVE  AND  INVOLVE  PROLONGED  AND  OFTEN  PAINFUL  RECOVERY  PERIODS.

CPAP, BY CONTRAST, IS A NON-INVASIVE MEANS OF TREATING OSA.  CPAP WAS FIRST USED
AS  A  TREATMENT FOR OSA IN 1980 BY DR. COLIN SULLIVAN, THE PAST CHAIRMAN OF OUR
MEDICAL ADVISORY BOARD. CPAP SYSTEMS WERE COMMERCIALIZED FOR TREATMENT OF OSA IN
THE  UNITED  STATES  IN  THE  MID  1980'S.  TODAY,  USE OF NASAL POSITIVE AIRWAY
PRESSURE  IS  GENERALLY  ACKNOWLEDGED  AS  THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND LEAST INVASIVE
THERAPY  FOR  MANAGING  OSA.

DURING  CPAP  TREATMENT, A PATIENT SLEEPS WITH A NASAL MASK CONNECTED TO A SMALL
PORTABLE  AIRFLOW  GENERATOR THAT DELIVERS ROOM AIR AT A POSITIVE PRESSURE.  THE
PATIENT  BREATHES  IN  AIR  FROM  THE FLOW GENERATOR AND BREATHES OUT THROUGH AN
EXHAUST  PORT  IN THE MASK.  CONTINUOUS AIR PRESSURE APPLIED IN THIS MANNER ACTS
AS A PNEUMATIC SPLINT TO KEEP THE UPPER AIRWAY OPEN AND UNOBSTRUCTED.  SOMETIMES
WHEN  A  PATIENT  LEAKS AIR THROUGH THEIR MOUTH, A FULL-FACE MASK MAY NEED TO BE
USED.

CPAP  IS  NOT  A  CURE  AND  THEREFORE, MUST BE USED ON A DAILY BASIS AS LONG AS
TREATMENT  IS  REQUIRED.  PATIENT  COMPLIANCE  HAS  BEEN  A  MAJOR FACTOR IN THE
EFFICACY  OF  CPAP  TREATMENT.  EARLY GENERATIONS OF CPAP UNITS PROVIDED LIMITED
PATIENT  COMFORT  AND  CONVENIENCE.  PATIENTS  EXPERIENCED  SORENESS  FROM  THE
REPEATED  USE  OF  NASAL  MASKS  AND HAD DIFFICULTY FALLING ASLEEP WITH THE CPAP
DEVICE  OPERATING  AT  THE  PRESCRIBED  PRESSURE.  IN MORE RECENT YEARS, PRODUCT
INNOVATIONS  TO  IMPROVE  PATIENT  COMFORT  AND  COMPLIANCE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED.
THESE  INCLUDE MORE COMFORTABLE MASK SYSTEMS; DELAY TIMERS WHICH GRADUALLY RAISE
AIR  PRESSURE  ALLOWING THE PATIENT TO FALL ASLEEP MORE EASILY; BILEVEL AIR FLOW
GENERATORS,  INCLUDING  VPAP  SYSTEMS, WHICH PROVIDE DIFFERENT AIR PRESSURES FOR
INHALATION  AND  EXHALATION;  HEATED  HUMIDIFICATION SYSTEMS TO MAKE THE AIRFLOW
MORE  COMFORTABLE;  AND AUTO TITRATION DEVICES WHICH REDUCE THE AVERAGE PRESSURE
DELIVERED  DURING  THE  NIGHT.

BUSINESS  STRATEGY

WE  BELIEVE  THAT  THE  SDB  MARKET WILL CONTINUE TO GROW IN THE FUTURE DUE TO A
NUMBER  OF FACTORS INCLUDING INCREASING AWARENESS OF OSA, IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING
OF THE ROLE OF SDB TREATMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CARDIAC, NEUROLOGIC, METABOLIC
AND RELATED DISORDERS, AND AN INCREASE IN HOME-BASED DIAGNOSIS. OUR STRATEGY FOR
EXPANDING  OUR  BUSINESS  OPERATIONS  AND  CAPITALIZING ON THE GROWTH OF THE SDB
MARKET  CONSISTS  OF  THE  FOLLOWING  KEY  ELEMENTS.

CONTINUE  PRODUCT  DEVELOPMENT  AND  INNOVATION.  WE  ARE  COMMITTED  TO ONGOING
INNOVATION  IN  DEVELOPING  PRODUCTS FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF SDB.  WE
HAVE  BEEN  A  LEADING  INNOVATOR OF PRODUCTS DESIGNED TO MORE EFFECTIVELY TREAT
SDB,  INCREASE PATIENT COMFORT AND ENCOURAGE COMPLIANCE WITH PRESCRIBED THERAPY.
FOR  EXAMPLE,  IN  1999  WE  INTRODUCED  THE  MIRAGE  FULL FACE MASK.  THIS MASK
CONTAINS  AN  INFLATABLE  AIR  POCKET,  WHICH  CONFORMS  TO THE PATIENT'S FACIAL
CONTOURS, CREATING A MORE COMFORTABLE AND BETTER SEAL.  ADDITIONALLY, IN 2002 WE
INTRODUCED  THE  AUTOSET  SPIRIT  FLOW  GENERATOR,  OUR  SECOND-GENERATION
AUTOTITRATING  DEVICE  THAT  ADAPTS  TO THE PATIENT'S BREATHING PATTERNS TO MORE
EFFECTIVELY  TREAT  OSA.  WE  BELIEVE  THAT  CONTINUED  PRODUCT  DEVELOPMENT AND
INNOVATION  ARE  KEY  FACTORS  TO  OUR ONGOING SUCCESS. APPROXIMATELY 17% OF OUR
EMPLOYEES  ARE  DEVOTED  TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.  IN FISCAL YEAR
2003,  WE  INVESTED  $20.5  MILLION,  OR  7.5%  OF OUR REVENUES, IN RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT.

EXPAND  GEOGRAPHIC  PRESENCE.  WE  MARKET  OUR  PRODUCTS IN OVER 60 COUNTRIES TO
SLEEP  CLINICS,  HOME  HEALTH CARE DEALERS AND THIRD PARTY PAYERS.  WE INTEND TO
INCREASE  OUR  SALES  AND MARKETING EFFORTS IN OUR PRINCIPAL MARKETS, AS WELL AS
EXPAND  THE  DEPTH  OF  OUR  PRESENCE  IN  OTHER  GEOGRAPHIC  REGIONS.

INCREASE  PUBLIC  AND  CLINICAL  AWARENESS.  WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR
EXISTING  PROMOTIONAL  ACTIVITIES TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF SDB AND OUR TREATMENT
ALTERNATIVES.  THESE  PROMOTIONAL  ACTIVITIES  TARGET  THE  POPULATION  WITH
PREDISPOSITION  TO  SDB AS WELL AS PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND SPECIALISTS, SUCH
AS  CARDIOLOGISTS,  NEUROLOGISTS AND PULMONOLOGISTS. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO TARGET
SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, INCLUDING THE NATIONAL STROKE ASSOCIATION, THE AMERICAN
HEART  ASSOCIATION  AND  THE  NATIONAL  SLEEP  FOUNDATION.

DURING  FISCAL  2002,  WE  DONATED  A  TOTAL OF $2.3 MILLION TO THE RESMED SLEEP
DISORDERED  BREATHING  FOUNDATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND AUSTRALIA TO FURTHER
ENHANCE RESEARCH AND AWARENESS OF SDB.  THE FOUNDATIONS' CONTRIBUTIONS REPRESENT
RESMED'S  COMMITMENT  TO  MEDICAL  RESEARCH  INTO  SLEEP-DISORDERED  BREATHING,
PARTICULARLY  THE  TREATMENT  OF  OBSTRUCTIVE  SLEEP  APNEA.

EXPAND  INTO  NEW  CLINICAL  APPLICATIONS.  WE  CONTINUALLY SEEK TO IDENTIFY NEW
APPLICATIONS  OF  OUR  TECHNOLOGY  FOR  SIGNIFICANT UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS.  RECENT
STUDIES  HAVE ESTABLISHED A CLINICAL ASSOCIATION BETWEEN OSA AND BOTH STROKE AND
CONGESTIVE  HEART FAILURE, AND HAVE RECOGNIZED SDB AS A CAUSE OF HYPERTENSION OR
HIGH  BLOOD  PRESSURE.  WE  HAVE DEVELOPED A DEVICE, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED
FOR  SALE  IN THE UNITED STATES, FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHEYNE-STOKES BREATHING IN
PATIENTS  WITH  CONGESTIVE  HEART  FAILURE.  CURRENTLY, 1,000 PATIENTS ARE BEING
TREATED  BY  THIS  DEVICE  IN EUROPE WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF
LIFE  AND  HEART FUNCTION.  IN ADDITION, WE MAINTAIN CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS
WITH  A  NUMBER  OF PROMINENT PHYSICIANS TO EXPLORE NEW MEDICAL APPLICATIONS FOR
OUR  PRODUCTS  AND  TECHNOLOGY.

LEVERAGE  THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM AND MEDICAL ADVISORY BOARD.  OUR
SENIOR  MANAGEMENT  TEAM HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE MEDICAL DEVICE INDUSTRY
IN  GENERAL,  AND IN THE FIELD OF SDB IN PARTICULAR.  OUR MEDICAL ADVISORY BOARD
IS  COMPRISED  OF EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF SDB. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE
THE  EXPERIENCE  AND  EXPERTISE  OF THESE INDIVIDUALS TO MAINTAIN OUR INNOVATIVE
APPROACH  TO  THE  DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS AND INCREASE AWARENESS OF THE SERIOUS
MEDICAL  PROBLEMS  CAUSED  BY  SDB.

PRODUCTS

OUR  PORTFOLIO  OF  PRODUCTS  FOR  THE  TREATMENT  OF OSA AND OTHER FORMS OF SDB
INCLUDES  AIRFLOW  GENERATORS,  DIAGNOSTIC  PRODUCTS, MASK SYSTEMS, HEADGEAR AND
OTHER  ACCESSORIES.

AIR  FLOW  GENERATORS
WE  PRODUCE  CPAP,  VPAP  AND  AUTOSET  SYSTEMS FOR THE DIAGNOSIS, TITRATION AND
TREATMENT  OF  SDB.  THE FLOW GENERATOR SYSTEMS DELIVER POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE
THROUGH  A  SMALL  NASAL  MASK  (OR  SOMETIMES  A  FULL-FACE  MASK).

OUR  VPAP  UNITS DELIVER ULTRA-QUIET, COMFORTABLE BILEVEL THERAPY. THERE ARE TWO
PRESET  PRESSURES:  A  HIGHER  PRESSURE  AS THE PATIENT BREATHES IN, AND A LOWER
PRESSURE  AS  THE  PATIENT  BREATHES OUT. BREATHING OUT AGAINST A LOWER PRESSURE
MAKES  TREATMENT  MORE  COMFORTABLE,  PARTICULARLY  FOR  PATIENTS  WHO NEED HIGH
PRESSURE  LEVELS  OR  FOR  THOSE  WITH  IMPAIRED  BREATHING  ABILITY.

AUTOSET  SYSTEMS  ARE BASED ON A PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY TO MONITOR BREATHING AND
CAN  ALSO  BE  USED IN THE DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF OSA.  CPAP AND
VPAP  AIR  FLOW GENERATORS, TOGETHER WITH OUR DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS, ACCOUNTED FOR
APPROXIMATELY  54%,  58%  AND 57% OF OUR NET REVENUES IN FISCAL YEARS 2003, 2002
AND  2001,  RESPECTIVELY.

MASK  SYSTEMS

MASK  SYSTEMS  ARE  ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF SDB TREATMENT SYSTEMS.
MASKS  ARE  A  PRIMARY  DETERMINANT  OF PATIENT COMFORT AND AS SUCH MAY DRIVE OR
IMPEDE  PATIENT COMPLIANCE WITH THERAPY.  WE HAVE BEEN A CONSISTENT INNOVATOR IN
MASKS,  IMPROVING  PATIENT  COMFORT  WHILE  MINIMIZING  SIZE AND WEIGHT.  MASKS,
ACCESSORIES  AND  MOTORS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 46%, 42% AND 43% OF OUR NET
REVENUES  IN  FISCAL  YEARS  2003,  2002  AND  2001,  RESPECTIVELY.




DIAGNOSTIC  PRODUCTS

WE  MARKET  SLEEP  RECORDERS  FOR  THE  DIAGNOSIS  AND TITRATION OF SDB IN SLEEP
CLINICS  AND HOSPITALS. THESE DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS RECORD RELEVANT RESPIRATORY AND
SLEEP  DATA,  WHICH  CAN  BE ANALYZED BY A SLEEP SPECIALIST OR PHYSICIAN WHO CAN
THEN  TAILOR  AN  APPROPRIATE  OSA  TREATMENT  REGIMEN  FOR  THE  PATIENT.

ACCESSORIES  AND  OTHER  PRODUCTS

TO  ENHANCE  PATIENT COMFORT, CONVENIENCE AND COMPLIANCE, WE MARKET A VARIETY OF
OTHER PRODUCTS AND ACCESSORIES.  THESE PRODUCTS INCLUDE HUMIDIFIERS, SUCH AS THE
HUMIDAIRE  AND  H2I, WHICH CONNECT DIRECTLY WITH THE CPAP, VPAP AND AUTOSET FLOW
GENERATORS  TO  HUMIDIFY  AND  HEAT THE AIR DELIVERED TO THE PATIENT.  THEIR USE
PREVENTS  THE DRYING OF NASAL PASSAGES THAT CAN CAUSE DISCOMFORT. OTHER OPTIONAL
ACCESSORIES  INCLUDE  COLD  PASSOVER  HUMIDIFIERS,  CARRY  BAGS  AND  BREATHING
CIRCUITS.  MAP ALSO OFFERS A RANGE OF ACCESSORIES, INCLUDING THE TWISTER REMOTE,
AN  INTELLIGENT  REMOTE  CONTROL FOR USE IN THE SLEEP LAB ENVIRONMENT TO SET AND
MONITOR FLOW GENERATORS, THE AERO-CLICK CONNECTION SYSTEM, WHICH ALLOWS A QUICK,
SIMPLE  CONNECT/DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE MASK AND CPAP AIR DELIVERY SOURCE AND THE
AEROFIX  HEADGEAR,  FOR  THE  COMFORTABLE  ADJUSTMENT OF MASKS FOR CPAP THERAPY.
SINCE  THE  MAY  2002  ACQUISITION  OF SERVO MAGNETICS INC., WE HAVE SOLD CUSTOM
ELECTRIC  MOTORS,  PRIMARILY FOR USE IN DATA STORAGE AND AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS.


PRODUCT  DEVELOPMENT  AND  CLINICAL  TRIALS

WE  HAVE  A  STRONG TRACK RECORD IN INNOVATION IN THE SLEEP MARKET.  IN 1989, WE
INTRODUCED  OUR  FIRST  CPAP  DEVICE.  SINCE  THEN  WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO AN
ONGOING  PROGRAM OF PRODUCT ADVANCEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT.  CURRENTLY, OUR PRODUCT
DEVELOPMENT  EFFORTS  ARE  FOCUSED  ON  NOT  ONLY  IMPROVING OUR CURRENT PRODUCT
OFFERINGS,  BUT  ALSO  EXPANDING INTO NEW PRODUCT APPLICATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN
1997,  WE  INTRODUCED  THE  MIRAGE  MASK.  THIS MASK WAS BASED ON THE INNOVATIVE
BUBBLE  MASK  TECHNOLOGY  INTRODUCED  IN  1991,  WHICH USED THE PRINCIPLE OF AIR
INFLATION  OF  THE  MASK CUSHION TO CREATE A MORE COMFORTABLE AND BETTER SEAL BY
BETTER  CONFORMING  TO  PATIENT  FACIAL  CONTOURS.

IN  1999,  WE  INTRODUCED  THE AUTOSET T FLOW GENERATOR, AN AUTOTITRATING DEVICE
THAT  ADAPTS  TO THE PATIENT'S BREATHING PATTERNS TO EFFECTIVELY PREVENT APNEAS.
IN  2001,  WE  INTRODUCED  OUR NEXT GENERATION AUTOTITRATING DEVICE, THE AUTOSET
SPIRIT.  THE  AUTOSET  SPIRIT  IS  AN AUTOTITRATING MODULAR DEVICE WITH OPTIONAL
INTEGRATED  HUMIDIFIER.  CURRENTLY,  WE  ARE BRINGING TO MARKET THE ACTIVA NASAL
MASK  USING  OUR  PATENTED  ACTIVE CUSHION TECHNOLOGY, WHICH AUTOMATICALLY SEALS
MASK LEAKS.  WE ARE ALSO ABOUT TO LAUNCH OUR IMPROVED AUTOSET CS II (OUTSIDE THE
U.S.  ONLY)  TO TREAT CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE PATIENTS WITH SIGNIFICANT CENTRAL
SLEEP  APNEA.

WE  CONTINUALLY  SEEK  TO  IDENTIFY  NEW  APPLICATIONS  OF  OUR  TECHNOLOGY  FOR
SIGNIFICANT  UNMET  MEDICAL  NEEDS.  SDB IS ASSOCIATED WITH A NUMBER OF SYMPTOMS
BEYOND  EXCESSIVE  DAYTIME  SLEEPINESS  AND  IRRITABILITY.  RECENT  STUDIES HAVE
ESTABLISHED  A  CLINICAL  ASSOCIATION  BETWEEN SDB AND HYPERTENSION, STROKE, AND
CONGESTIVE  HEART  FAILURE.  WE  SUPPORT  CLINICAL  TRIALS IN THE UNITED STATES,
GERMANY,  FRANCE,  THE  UNITED  KINGDOM  AND  AUSTRALIA  TO DEVELOP NEW CLINICAL
APPLICATIONS  FOR  OUR  TECHNOLOGY.

WE  CONSULT  WITH  PHYSICIANS  AT  MAJOR  SLEEP  CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO
IDENTIFY  TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS IN THE TREATMENT OF SDB. SOME OF THESE PHYSICIANS
CURRENTLY  SERVE  ON  OUR  MEDICAL  ADVISORY  BOARD.  NEW PRODUCT IDEAS ARE ALSO
IDENTIFIED  BY OUR MARKETING STAFF, DIRECT SALES FORCE, NETWORK OF DISTRIBUTORS,
MANUFACTURERS' REPRESENTATIVES, CUSTOMERS, AND PATIENTS. TYPICALLY, OUR INTERNAL
DEVELOPMENT  STAFF  THEN  PERFORM  NEW  PRODUCT  DEVELOPMENT.

IN  FISCAL  YEARS  2003, 2002 AND 2001, WE INVESTED $20.5 MILLION, $14.9 MILLION
AND  $11.1  MILLION,  RESPECTIVELY,  ON  RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT.

RAISES  THE  AWARENESS  OF  SDB  AS  A  SIGNIFICANT  HEALTH  CONCERN.


MANUFACTURING

OUR  PRINCIPAL  MANUFACTURING  FACILITIES  ARE  LOCATED IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA AND
COMPRISE  A  120,000  SQUARE  FEET  MANUFACTURING  AND  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
FACILITY.  WE  ALSO  RENT SOME SPACE IN NEARBY BUILDINGS.  WE ARE IN THE PROCESS
OF  BUILDING  A NEW 215,000 SQUARE FEET MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN SYDNEY, DUE TO
BE  COMPLETED  IN THE FIRST HALF OF CALENDAR 2004.  OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS
CONSIST  PRIMARILY  OF  ASSEMBLY  AND  TESTING OF OUR FLOW GENERATORS, MASKS AND
ACCESSORIES.  OF  THE NUMEROUS RAW MATERIALS, PARTS AND COMPONENTS PURCHASED FOR
ASSEMBLY  OF  OUR  THERAPEUTIC  AND DIAGNOSTIC SLEEP DISORDER PRODUCTS, MOST ARE
OFF-THE-SHELF  ITEMS  AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE VENDORS.  WE GENERALLY MANUFACTURE
TO  OUR INTERNAL SALES FORECASTS AND FILL ORDERS AS RECEIVED.  OVER THE LAST TWO
YEARS  THE  MANUFACTURING  PROCESSES  HAVE  BEEN  TRANSFORMED  ALONG WORLD CLASS
MANUFACTURING GUIDELINES TO FLOW LINES STAFFED BY DEDICATED TEAMS.  EACH TEAM IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR MANUFACTURE AND QUALITY OF THEIR PRODUCT GROUP AND DECISIONS ARE
BASED  ON  PERFORMANCE  AND  QUALITY  MEASURES  INCLUDING  CUSTOMER  FEEDBACK.

- -11-



OUR  QUALITY  MANAGEMENT  SYSTEM  IS  BASED  UPON  THE REQUIREMENTS OF ISO 9001,
EN46001 (EUROPEAN MEDICAL STANDARDS), FDA QUALITY SYSTEM REGULATIONS FOR MEDICAL
DEVICES  (21  CFR  PART  820) AND THE MEDICAL DEVICE DIRECTIVE (93/42/EEC).  OUR
SYDNEY,  AUSTRALIA  FACILITY  IS  ACCREDITED TO ISO 9001 AND EN46001 AND OUR SAN
DIEGO,  CALIFORNIA  FACILITY  IS  ACCREDITED TO ISO 9002 AND EN46002.  THESE TWO
SITES  HAVE  THIRD  PARTY  AUDITS  CONDUCTED  BY THE ISO CERTIFICATION BODIES AT
REGULAR  INTERVALS.

OUR  GERMAN  MANUFACTURING  OPERATION  BASED IN MUNICH OPERATES IN A FACILITY OF
APPROXIMATELY  24,000  SQUARE FEET.  THIS FACILITY IS ACCREDITED TO ISO 9001 AND
EN46001  AND  PRIMARILY  ASSEMBLES  AND  TESTS  FLOW  GENERATORS FOR SALE BY OUR
SUBSIDIARY  MAP  GMBH.  APPROPRIATE QUALITY CONTROLS MONITOR AND MEASURE PRODUCT
ASSEMBLY  AND  PERFORMANCE.

IN  ADDITION  TO  OUR  AUSTRALIAN  AND  GERMAN  MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS WE ALSO
MANUFACTURE HIGH QUALITY ELECTRIC MOTORS FOR BOTH OUR FLOW GENERATOR DEVICES AND
EXTERNAL  CUSTOMERS, PRIMARILY IN THE DATA STORAGE AND AEROSPACE SECTORS, AT OUR
SERVO  MAGNETICS  INC.  (SMI)  FACILITY  AT  CANOGA  PARK,  CALIFORNIA.  THE SMI
FACILITY  IS  APPROXIMATELY  35,500  SQUARE  FEET.


THIRD-PARTY  REIMBURSEMENT

THE  COST OF MEDICAL CARE IN MANY OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE IS FUNDED
IN  SUBSTANTIAL  PART BY GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE INSURANCE PROGRAMS.  ALTHOUGH WE
DO  NOT  GENERALLY RECEIVE PAYMENTS FOR OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY FROM THESE PAYERS,
OUR SUCCESS IN MAJOR MARKETS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE ABILITY OF PATIENTS TO OBTAIN
ADEQUATE  REIMBURSEMENT  FOR  OUR  PRODUCTS.

IN  THE  UNITED STATES, OUR PRODUCTS ARE PURCHASED PRIMARILY BY HOME HEALTH CARE
DEALERS,  HOSPITALS  OR  SLEEP  CLINICS,  WHICH  THEN INVOICE THIRD-PARTY PAYERS
DIRECTLY.  DOMESTIC THIRD-PARTY PAYERS INCLUDE MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND CORPORATE
HEALTH  INSURANCE  PLANS.  THESE PAYERS MAY DENY REIMBURSEMENT IF THEY DETERMINE
THAT  A  DEVICE IS NOT USED IN ACCORDANCE WITH COST-EFFECTIVE TREATMENT METHODS,
OR  IS  EXPERIMENTAL, UNNECESSARY OR INAPPROPRIATE.  THE LONG-TERM TREND TOWARDS
MANAGED  HEALTH  CARE,  OR  LEGISLATIVE  PROPOSALS  TO REFORM HEALTH CARE, COULD
CONTROL  OR  SIGNIFICANTLY  INFLUENCE  THE  PURCHASE OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND
PRODUCTS  AND  COULD  RESULT  IN  LOWER  PRICES  FOR  OUR  PRODUCTS.

IN THE UNITED STATES, WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO HOME HEALTH CARE DEALERS
AND  TO  SLEEP CLINICS; WE DO NOT FILE CLAIMS AND BILL GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS AND
OTHER  THIRD-PARTY  PAYERS  DIRECTLY  FOR  REIMBURSEMENT  FOR  OUR  PRODUCTS.
NEVERTHELESS,  WE  ARE  STILL  SUBJECT  TO  LAWS  AND  REGULATIONS  RELATING  TO
GOVERNMENTAL  PROGRAMS,  AND  ANY  VIOLATION OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD
RESULT  IN  CIVIL  AND  CRIMINAL  PENALTIES,  INCLUDING  FINES.

IN  PARTICULAR,  THE  FEDERAL ANTI-KICKBACK LAW PROHIBITS PERSONS FROM KNOWINGLY
AND  WILLFULLY  SOLICITING,  RECEIVING,  OFFERING  OR  PROVIDING  REMUNERATION,
DIRECTLY  OR  INDIRECTLY, TO INDUCE EITHER THE REFERRAL OF AN INDIVIDUAL, OR THE
FURNISHING,  RECOMMENDING  OR ARRANGING FOR A GOOD OR SERVICE, FOR WHICH PAYMENT
MAY BE MADE UNDER A FEDERAL HEALTHCARE PROGRAM SUCH AS THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID
PROGRAMS.  THE  GOVERNMENT  HAS  INTERPRETED  THIS  LAW  BROADLY TO APPLY TO THE
MARKETING  AND SALES ACTIVITIES OF MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS LIKE US.  MANY
STATES  HAVE ADOPTED LAWS SIMILAR TO THE FEDERAL ANTI-KICKBACK LAW.  WE ARE ALSO
SUBJECT  TO  OTHER  FEDERAL  AND STATE FRAUD LAWS APPLICABLE TO PAYMENT FROM ANY
THIRD-PARTY  PAYER.  THESE  LAWS  PROHIBIT  PERSONS FROM KNOWINGLY AND WILLFULLY
FILING  FALSE  CLAIMS  OR  EXECUTING  A SCHEME TO DEFRAUD ANY HEALTHCARE BENEFIT
PROGRAM,  INCLUDING  PRIVATE  THIRD-PARTY  PAYERS.  THESE  LAWS  MAY  APPLY  TO
MANUFACTURERS  AND  DISTRIBUTORS WHO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON COVERAGE, CODING AND
REIMBURSEMENT  OF  THEIR  PRODUCTS  TO  PERSONS WHO BILL THIRD-PARTY PAYERS.  WE
CONTINUOUSLY  STRIVE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND BELIEVE THAT OUR ARRANGEMENTS
DO  NOT  VIOLATE  THESE  LAWS.  LIABILITY MAY STILL ARISE FROM THE INTENTIONS OR
ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS OR FROM A DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTAL
AGENCY  INTERPRETATION  OF  THE  LAWS.

- -12-


IN  SOME  FOREIGN  MARKETS,  SUCH  AS  SPAIN,  FRANCE  AND  GERMANY,  GOVERNMENT
REIMBURSEMENT  IS  CURRENTLY  AVAILABLE  FOR PURCHASE OR RENTAL OF OUR PRODUCTS,
HOWEVER,  SUBJECT  TO  CONSTRAINTS  SUCH  AS  PRICE  CONTROLS  OR  UNIT  SALES
LIMITATIONS.  IN AUSTRALIA AND IN SOME OTHER FOREIGN MARKETS, THERE IS CURRENTLY
LIMITED  OR  NO  REIMBURSEMENT  FOR  DEVICES  THAT  TREAT  OSA.


SERVICE  AND  WARRANTY

WE  GENERALLY  OFFER  ONE-TO-TWO  YEAR  LIMITED WARRANTIES ON OUR FLOW GENERATOR
PRODUCTS.  WARRANTIES ON MASK SYSTEMS ARE FOR 90 DAYS.  IN MOST MARKETS, WE RELY
ON  OUR  DISTRIBUTORS  TO REPAIR OUR PRODUCTS WITH PARTS SUPPLIED BY US.  IN THE
UNITED  STATES,  HOME HEALTH CARE DEALERS GENERALLY ARRANGE SHIPMENT OF PRODUCTS
TO  OUR  SAN  DIEGO  FACILITY  FOR  REPAIR.

WE  RECEIVE  RETURNS  OF  OUR  PRODUCTS  FROM THE FIELD FOR VARIOUS REASONS.  WE
BELIEVE  THAT THE LEVEL OF RETURNS EXPERIENCED TO DATE IS CONSISTENT WITH LEVELS
TYPICALLY  EXPERIENCED  BY  MANUFACTURERS  OF  SIMILAR  DEVICES.  WE PROVIDE FOR
WARRANTIES  AND  RETURNS  BASED  ON  HISTORICAL  DATA.


COMPETITION

THE  MARKETS  FOR  OUR  PRODUCTS  ARE  HIGHLY  COMPETITIVE.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE
PRINCIPAL  COMPETITIVE  FACTORS  IN  ALL  OF  OUR  MARKETS ARE PRODUCT FEATURES,
RELIABILITY  AND PRICE.  CUSTOMER SUPPORT, REPUTATION AND EFFICIENT DISTRIBUTION
ARE  ALSO  IMPORTANT  FACTORS.

WE  COMPETE  ON  A  MARKET-BY-MARKET BASIS WITH VARIOUS COMPANIES, SOME OF WHICH
HAVE  GREATER  FINANCIAL,  RESEARCH,  MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING RESOURCES THAN
OURSELVES.  IN  THE  UNITED  STATES,  OUR  PRINCIPAL  MARKET, RESPIRONICS, INC.,
DEVILBISS,  A  DIVISION  OF SUNRISE MEDICAL INC., AND NELLCOR PURITAN BENNETT, A
SUBSIDIARY OF TYCO INC., ARE THE PRIMARY COMPETITORS FOR OUR CPAP PRODUCTS.  OUR
PRINCIPAL  EUROPEAN  COMPETITORS  ARE  ALSO  RESPIRONICS, DEVILBISS, AND NELLCOR
PURITAN  BENNETT,  AS  WELL  AS  REGIONAL EUROPEAN MANUFACTURERS.  THE DISPARITY
BETWEEN  OUR  RESOURCES AND THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS MAY INCREASE AS A RESULT OF
THE  RECENT  TREND  TOWARDS  CONSOLIDATION  IN  THE  HEALTH  CARE  INDUSTRY.  IN
ADDITION,  OUR  PRODUCTS  COMPETE WITH SURGICAL PROCEDURES AND DENTAL APPLIANCES
DESIGNED  TO  TREAT  OSA  AND  OTHER  SDB  RELATED  RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS.  THE
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW OR INNOVATIVE PROCEDURES OR DEVICES BY OTHERS COULD RESULT IN
OUR  PRODUCTS  BECOMING  OBSOLETE  OR  NONCOMPETITIVE,  RESULTING  IN A MATERIAL
ADVERSE  EFFECT  ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ANY PRODUCT DEVELOPED BY US THAT GAINS REGULATORY CLEARANCE WILL HAVE TO COMPETE
FOR MARKET ACCEPTANCE AND MARKET SHARE.  AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN SUCH COMPETITION
MAY  BE THE TIMING OF MARKET INTRODUCTION OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS.  ACCORDINGLY,
THE RELATIVE SPEED WITH WHICH WE CAN DEVELOP PRODUCTS, COMPLETE CLINICAL TESTING
AND  REGULATORY  CLEARANCE  PROCESSES  AND  SUPPLY  COMMERCIAL QUANTITIES OF THE
PRODUCT  TO  THE  MARKET  ARE  EXPECTED TO BE IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS.  IN
ADDITION,  OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE WILL CONTINUE TO BE DEPENDENT ON THE EXTENT TO
WHICH  WE  ARE  SUCCESSFUL  IN  PROTECTING  OUR  PATENTS  AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY.

- -13-


PATENTS  AND  PROPRIETARY  RIGHTS  AND  RELATED  LITIGATION

THROUGH  OUR  SUBSIDIARIES  RESMED  LIMITED, MEDIZINTECHNIK FUR ARZT UND PATIENT
GMBH AND SMI, WE OWN OR HAVE LICENSED RIGHTS TO 108 ISSUED UNITED STATES PATENTS
(INCLUDING  24  DESIGN  PATENTS)  AND  135 ISSUED FOREIGN PATENTS.  IN ADDITION,
THERE  ARE  139  PENDING  UNITED STATES PATENT APPLICATIONS (INCLUDING 23 DESIGN
PATENT APPLICATIONS) AND 249 PENDING FOREIGN PATENT APPLICATIONS.  SOME OF THESE
PATENTS  AND  PATENT  APPLICATIONS RELATE TO SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS AND FEATURES OF
OUR  PRODUCTS.  THESE INCLUDE U.S. PATENTS RELATING TO OUR CPAP DEVICES, A DELAY
TIMER  SYSTEM,  THE  BUBBLE MASK, AND AN AUTOMATED MEANS OF VARYING AIR PRESSURE
BASED  UPON A PATIENT'S CHANGING NEEDS DURING NIGHTLY USE, SUCH AS THAT EMPLOYED
IN  OUR  AUTOSET  DEVICE.

OF  OUR PATENTS, FOUR UNITED STATES PATENTS AND THREE FOREIGN PATENTS ARE DUE TO
EXPIRE  IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, WITH ONE FOREIGN PATENT DUE TO EXPIRE IN EACH OF
THE  YEARS  2004,  2005  AND  2007 AND TWO UNITED STATES PATENTS IN 2007 AND ONE
UNITED  STATES  PATENT  IN EACH OF THE YEARS 2005 AND 2008.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE
EXPIRATION  OF  THESE  PATENTS  WILL  NOT  HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR
COMPETITIVE  POSITION.

WE  RELY  ON  A  COMBINATION  OF  PATENTS,  TRADE  SECRETS,  TRADE  MARKS  AND
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY AND RIGHTS.  OUR
SUBSIDIARY,  RESMED  LIMITED,  IS  PURSUING  INFRINGEMENT  ACTIONS  AGAINST  A
COMPETITOR  AND  IS INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE INFRINGEMENT BY OTHERS.  SEE ITEM 3 -
"LEGAL  PROCEEDINGS".

ADDITIONAL  LITIGATION  MAY BE NECESSARY TO ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE PATENTS ISSUED TO
US, TO PROTECT OUR RIGHTS, OR TO DEFEND THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT BY US
OF  THE  PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS.  PATENT LAWS REGARDING THE ENFORCEABILITY
OF  PATENTS  VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY.  THEREFORE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE
THAT  PATENT  ISSUES WILL BE UNIFORMLY RESOLVED, OR THAT LOCAL LAWS WILL PROVIDE
US  WITH  CONSISTENT  RIGHTS  AND  BENEFITS.


GOVERNMENT  REGULATIONS

OUR  PRODUCTS  ARE  SUBJECT  TO  EXTENSIVE REGULATION PARTICULARLY AS TO SAFETY,
EFFICACY  AND  ADHERENCE  TO  FDA QUALITY SYSTEM REGULATION, OR QSR, AND RELATED
MANUFACTURING STANDARDS. MEDICAL DEVICE PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO RIGOROUS FDA AND
OTHER  GOVERNMENTAL  AGENCY  REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND REGULATIONS OF
RELEVANT  FOREIGN  AGENCIES  ABROAD.  THE  FDA  REGULATES  THE  INTRODUCTION,
MANUFACTURE,  ADVERTISING,  LABELING,  PACKAGING,  MARKETING,  DISTRIBUTION, AND
RECORD  KEEPING  FOR  SUCH  PRODUCTS,  IN  ORDER TO ENSURE THAT MEDICAL PRODUCTS
DISTRIBUTED  IN THE UNITED STATES ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FOR THEIR INTENDED USE.
IN  ADDITION,  THE  FDA  IS  AUTHORIZED TO ESTABLISH SPECIAL CONTROLS TO PROVIDE
REASONABLE  ASSURANCE  OF  THE  SAFETY  AND  EFFECTIVENESS OF MOST DEVICES.  NON
COMPLIANCE  WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS CAN RESULT IN IMPORT DETENTIONS, FINES,
CIVIL  PENALTIES,  INJUNCTIONS,  SUSPENSIONS  OR LOSSES OF REGULATORY APPROVALS,
RECALL OR SEIZURE OF PRODUCTS, OPERATING RESTRICTIONS, REFUSAL OF THE GOVERNMENT
TO  APPROVE  PRODUCT  EXPORT  APPLICATIONS  OR  ALLOW  US  TO  ENTER INTO SUPPLY
CONTRACTS,  AND  CRIMINAL  PROSECUTION.

THE  FDA  REQUIRES THAT A MANUFACTURER INTRODUCING A NEW MEDICAL DEVICE OR A NEW
INDICATION  FOR USE OF AN EXISTING MEDICAL DEVICE OBTAIN EITHER A SECTION 510(K)
PREMARKET  NOTIFICATION  CLEARANCE  OR A PREMARKET APPROVAL, OR PMA, PRIOR TO IT
BEING  INTRODUCED  INTO  THE U.S. MARKET. OUR PRODUCTS CURRENTLY MARKETED IN THE
UNITED  STATES  ARE  MARKETED  IN RELIANCE ON 510(K) PRE-MARKETING CLEARANCES AS
EITHER  CLASS  I  OR CLASS II DEVICES. THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING A SECTION 510(K)
CLEARANCE  GENERALLY  REQUIRES  THE  SUBMISSION  OF  PERFORMANCE  DATA AND OFTEN
CLINICAL  DATA,  WHICH  IN  SOME CASES CAN BE EXTENSIVE, TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE
DEVICE  IS  "SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT'' TO A DEVICE THAT WAS ON THE MARKET PRIOR
TO  1976  OR  TO  A  DEVICE  THAT HAS BEEN FOUND BY THE FDA TO BE "SUBSTANTIALLY
EQUIVALENT''  TO SUCH A PRE-1976 DEVICE.  AS A RESULT, FDA APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS
MAY  EXTEND  THE  DEVELOPMENT  PROCESS  FOR  A  CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME.  IN
ADDITION,  IN  SOME  CASES, THE FDA MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL REVIEW BY AN ADVISORY
PANEL,  WHICH  CAN  FURTHER  LENGTHEN  THE  PROCESS.  THE  PMA PROCESS, WHICH IS
RESERVED  FOR NEW DEVICES THAT ARE NOT SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT TO ANY PREDICATE
DEVICE  AND  FOR  HIGH RISK DEVICES OR THOSE THAT ARE USED TO SUPPORT OR SUSTAIN
HUMAN  LIFE,  MAY  TAKE  SEVERAL  YEARS AND REQUIRES THE SUBMISSION OF EXTENSIVE
PERFORMANCE  AND  CLINICAL  INFORMATION.

AS  A  MEDICAL  DEVICE  MANUFACTURER,  ALL  OF  OUR  DOMESTIC  AND  AUSTRALIAN
MANUFACTURING  FACILITIES  ARE  SUBJECT  TO INSPECTION ON A ROUTINE BASIS BY THE
FDA.  WE  BELIEVE  THAT OUR DESIGN, MANUFACTURING AND QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES
ARE  IN  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPLIANCE  WITH  THE FDA'S REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. MAP'S
FACILITIES  ARE NOT SUBJECT TO FDA REGULATION, BECAUSE NONE OF MAP'S PRODUCTS IS
CURRENTLY  MARKETED  IN  THE  UNITED  STATES.

SALES  OF  MEDICAL  DEVICES  OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY
REQUIREMENTS THAT VARY WIDELY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY.  APPROVAL FOR SALE OF OUR
MEDICAL  DEVICES  IN  EUROPE IS THROUGH THE CE MARK PROCESS.  WHERE APPROPRIATE,
OUR  PRODUCTS  ARE  CE  MARKED TO THE EUROPEAN UNION'S MEDICAL DEVICE DIRECTIVE.
UNDER  THE CE MARKETING SCHEME, OUR PRODUCTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER CLASS I OR
CLASS  II;  OUR  DEVICES  ARE LISTED IN THE UNITED STATES WITH FDA; IN AUSTRALIA
WITH  THE  THERAPEUTIC  GOODS  ADMINISTRATION, OR TGA; AND IN CANADA WITH HEALTH
CANADA.

CERTAIN  OF  ITS  PATENTS  DURING  THE  FISCAL  YEAR.

- -17-


1995  LITIGATION  WITH  RESPIRONICS.  IN  JANUARY  1995,  OUR SUBSIDIARY, RESMED
LIMITED,  FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN
DISTRICT  OF  CALIFORNIA  SEEKING  MONETARY  DAMAGES  FROM AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
AGAINST  RESPIRONICS, INC. FOR ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT OF THREE OF ITS PATENTS.  IN
FEBRUARY  1995, RESPIRONICS FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
WESTERN  DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA, IN PITTSBURGH, AGAINST RESMED LIMITED SEEKING
A  DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT RESPIRONICS, INC. DOES NOT INFRINGE CLAIMS OF THESE
PATENTS  AND  THAT  RESMED LIMITED'S PATENTS ARE INVALID AND UNENFORCEABLE.  THE
RESPIRONICS  COMPLAINT  ALSO  MADE  THE  UNIVERSITY  OF  SYDNEY  A  PARTY AS THE
UNIVERSITY  OF  SYDNEY  IS  THE  ASSIGNEE  OF ONE OF THE PATENTS IN SUIT; RESMED
LIMITED IS THE EXCLUSIVE LICENSEE OF THAT PATENT.  THE TWO ACTIONS WERE COMBINED
AND  ARE  PROCEEDING  IN  THE  WESTERN  DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA.  IN JUNE 1996,
RESMED  LIMITED  FILED  AN  ADDITIONAL  COMPLAINT  AGAINST  RESPIRONICS  FOR
INFRINGEMENT OF A FOURTH RESMED PATENT, AND THAT COMPLAINT WAS CONSOLIDATED WITH
THE  EARLIER  ACTION.

THE  COURT  HAS  GRANTED  THREE  PARTIAL  SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTIONS, FINDING THAT
RESPIRONICS  DOES  NOT INFRINGE THREE OF THE FOUR PATENTS AT ISSUE.  IN DECEMBER
1999,  IN  RESPONSE  TO  THE COURT'S RULING ON RESPIRONICS, INC.'S THIRD SUMMARY
JUDGMENT  MOTION,  THE  PARTIES  JOINTLY STIPULATED TO A DISMISSAL OF CHARGES OF
INFRINGEMENT  UNDER THE FOURTH RESMED PATENT, WITH RESMED RESERVING THE RIGHT TO
REASSERT  THE  CHARGES IN THE EVENT OF A FAVORABLE RULING ON APPEAL OF THE THIRD
PARTIAL  SUMMARY  JUDGMENT.  ON SEPTEMBER 9, 2003, THE COURT VACATED THE SUMMARY
JUDGMENTS.

RESMED  AND  RESPIRONICS  HAVE  AGREED  TO  SETTLE  THIS  ACTION.  RESMED  AND
RESPIRONICS  WILL  DISMISS  ALL  CLAIMS  IN  THE  ACTION  WITH  PREJUDICE.

2002  LITIGATION  WITH  FISHER  & PAYKEL HEALTHCARE.  ON AUGUST 26, 2002, RESMED
INC., RESMED CORP. AND RESMED LIMITED FILED A LAWSUIT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR
THE  SOUTHERN  DISTRICT  OF  CALIFORNIA,  IN  SAN  DIEGO AGAINST FISHER & PAYKEL
HEALTHCARE  INC  AND  FISHER  &  PAYKEL  HEALTHCARE  LIMITED  ("FISHER  & PAYKEL
HEALTHCARE").  RESMED'S AMENDED COMPLAINT SOUGHT A JUDGMENT THAT SELECTED FISHER
&  PAYKEL  HEALTHCARE  MASK  PRODUCTS  INFRINGE  PATENTS  HELD  BY  RESMED.  THE
COMPLAINT  FURTHER CHARGED THE DEFENDANTS WITH THE COPYING OF RESMED PROPRIETARY
MASK  TECHNOLOGY  AND  ALLEGES VIOLATIONS OF THE LANHAM ACT, TRADEMARK AND TRADE
DRESS  INFRINGEMENT  AND  COMMON  LAW  VIOLATIONS  RELATING TO THE APPEARANCE OF
RESMED  MASK  PRODUCTS.

ON  MAY  6,  2003,  RESMED  AND FISHER & PAYKEL HEALTHCARE AGREED TO SETTLE THIS
PATENT INFRINGEMENT LAWSUIT.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SETTLEMENT, FISHER & PAYKEL
INTRODUCED  A  NEW DESIGN OF ITS MASK IN THE UNITED STATES BY AUGUST 1, 2003 AND
RESMED  WILL  NOT  ASSERT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS AGAINST THE NEW MASK.  IN
ADDITION,  FISHER  &  PAYKEL MAY CONTINUE TO SELL ITS EXISTING MASKS OUTSIDE THE
UNITED  STATES  UNTIL  OCTOBER  1,  2003,  UNDER  LICENSE  FROM RESMED, UNTIL IT
INTRODUCES  THE  NEW  VERSION  THERE.  RESMED  HAS  DISMISSED  THE  LAWSUIT WITH
PREJUDICE.

2002 LITIGATION WITH RESPIRONICS.  ON OCTOBER 11, 2002, RESMED INC, RESMED CORP,
AND  RESMED  LIMITED  FILED  A  LAWSUIT  IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN
DISTRICT  OF  CALIFORNIA,  IN  SAN DIEGO AGAINST RESPIRONICS, INC. RESMED'S SUIT
SEEKS  A  JUDGMENT  THAT  CERTAIN OF RESPIRONICS' MASK PRODUCTS (CONTOUR DELUXE,
COMFORT  CLASSIC,  COMFORT  SELECT,  AND  IMAGE3 MASKS) INFRINGE PATENTS HELD BY
RESMED.  THE  COMPLAINT  FURTHER  CHARGES  RESPIRONICS  WITH  COPYING  RESMED'S
PROPRIETARY  MASK TECHNOLOGY, AND ALLEGES VIOLATION OF THE LANHAM ACT, TRADEMARK
AND  TRADE  DRESS  INFRINGEMENT,  AND  COMMON  LAW  VIOLATIONS  RELATING  TO THE
APPEARANCE  OF  RESMED'S MASK PRODUCTS.  RESMED SEEKS AN INJUNCTION AND DAMAGES.
ON  MARCH  4, 2003, THE COURT DENIED RESPIRONICS' MOTION TO TRANSFER THE CASE TO
THE  U.S.  DISTRICT  COURT  FOR  THE  WESTERN  DISTRICT  OF  PENNSYLVANIA.

ON OCTOBER 16, 2002 RESPIRONICS, INC. FILED A LAWSUIT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR
THE  WESTERN  DISTRICT  OF  PENNSYLVANIA,  IN PITTSBURGH, AGAINST RESMED LIMITED
SEEKING  A  DECLARATORY  JUDGMENT  THAT  RESPIRONICS, INC. DOES NOT INFRINGE THE
PATENTS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF RESMED'S OCTOBER 11, 2002 COMPLAINT FILED IN SAN
DIEGO,  THAT SUCH PATENTS ARE INVALID AND UNENFORCEABLE AND THAT RESPIRONICS HAS
NOT  COMMITTED  ANY  OTHER  TRADEMARK, TRADE DRESS OR COMMON LAW VIOLATIONS.  ON
JULY  29,  2003, THE COURT ORDERED THE CASE TRANSFERRED TO THE US DISTRICT COURT
FOR  THE  SOUTHERN  DISTRICT  OF  CALIFORNIA.

- -18-


RESMED  AND RESPIRONICS HAVE AGREED TO SETTLE BOTH LAWSUITS INVOLVED IN THE 2002
LITIGATION.  RESMED  AND  RESPIRONICS  WILL  FILE  A  STIPULATION TO DISMISS ALL
CLAIMS  IN  THE  ACTIONS  WITH  PREJUDICE.

OTHER  LITIGATION.  IN  ADDITION  TO  THE MATTERS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IN THE NORMAL
COURSE  OF  BUSINESS,  WE  ARE  SUBJECT  TO ROUTINE LITIGATION INCIDENTAL TO OUR
BUSINESS.  WHILE  THE  RESULTS  OF  THIS  LITIGATION  CANNOT  BE  PREDICTED WITH
CERTAINTY,  WE BELIEVE THAT THEIR FINAL OUTCOME WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT  ON  OUR  CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  TAKEN  AS  A  WHOLE.

WE  DESIGN,  MANUFACTURE AND MARKET EQUIPMENT FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF

NET  REVENUES  ARE  GENERATED  FROM  THE  SALE  AND  RENTAL  OF OUR VARIOUS FLOW
GENERATOR DEVICES, NASAL MASK SYSTEMS, ACCESSORIES AND OTHER PRODUCTS, AND, TO A
LESSER  EXTENT  FROM  ROYALTIES  AND  SALES  OF  CUSTOM  MOTORS.

WE  HAVE  INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT
ENHANCEMENT.  SINCE  1989, WE HAVE DEVELOPED SEVERAL INNOVATIONS TO THE ORIGINAL
CPAP  DEVICE  TO INCREASE PATIENT COMFORT AND TO IMPROVE EASE OF PRODUCT USE. WE

BUSINESS  ACQUISITIONS

1.  FISCAL  YEAR  ENDED  JUNE  30,  2003

JOHN  STARK  AND  ASSOCIATES.  ON JULY 24, 2002 WE ACQUIRED THE BUSINESS OF JOHN
STARK  AND ASSOCIATES, OUR TEXAS REPRESENTATIVE, FOR TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF $0.3
MILLION  IN  CASH.  THE  ACQUISITION  HAS  BEEN  ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE AND
ACCORDINGLY,  THE  RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS  OF  JOHN  STARK  AND ASSOCIATES WERE
INCLUDED  WITHIN  OUR  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM JULY 24, 2002.  AN
AMOUNT  OF  $0.3 MILLION, REPRESENTING THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE
FAIR  VALUE  OF  NET  IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS ACQUIRED OF $NIL, HAS BEEN RECORDED AS
GOODWILL.


2.  FISCAL  YEAR  ENDED  JUNE  30,  2002

LABHARDT ACQUISITION.  ON NOVEMBER 15, 2001, WE ACQUIRED ALL THE COMMON STOCK OF
LABHARDT  AG,  OUR  SWISS  DISTRIBUTOR,  FOR TOTAL CASH CONSIDERATION, INCLUDING
ACQUISITION  COSTS,  OF  $5.5  MILLION.

THE  ACQUISITION  HAS  BEEN  ACCOUNTED  FOR  AS  A PURCHASE AND ACCORDINGLY, THE
RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS  OF  LABHARDT  AG HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  FROM  NOVEMBER  15,  2001.  AN  AMOUNT  OF  $4.2 MILLION,
REPRESENTING  THE  EXCESS  OF  THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET
IDENTIFIABLE  ASSETS  ACQUIRED  OF  $1.3 MILLION, HAS BEEN RECORDED AS GOODWILL.

- -22-


SMI  ACQUISITION.  ON MAY 14, 2002, WE ACQUIRED ALL OF THE COMMON STOCK OF SERVO
MAGNETICS  INCORPORATED  ("SMI")  THROUGH  A  MERGER  WITH  OUR  WHOLLY-OWNED
SUBSIDIARY, SERVO MAGNETICS ACQUISITIONS INC, FOR TOTAL CONSIDERATION, INCLUDING
ACQUISITION  COSTS,  OF  $32.6  MILLION.  CONSIDERATION  INCLUDED  THE  ISSUE OF
853,448  SHARES  FOR  FAIR  VALUE  OF  $24.8  MILLION  WITH  THE  BALANCE OF THE
ACQUISITION  PRICE PAID IN CASH.  UPON CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER, THE SURVIVING
CORPORATION,  SERVO  MAGNETICS  ACQUISITION  INC.,  CHANGED  ITS  NAME  TO SERVO
MAGNETICS  INC.

THE  ACQUISITION  HAS  BEEN  ACCOUNTED  FOR  AS  A PURCHASE AND ACCORDINGLY, THE
RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS  OF SMI HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  FROM  MAY  14,  2002.  AN  AMOUNT OF $30.7 MILLION, REPRESENTING THE
EXCESS  OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS
ACQUIRED  OF  $1.9  MILLION,  HAS  BEEN  RECORDED  AS  GOODWILL.

PURCHASED  IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF $0.4 MILLION WAS EXPENSED UPON
ACQUISITION  OF  SMI  BECAUSE  TECHNOLOGICAL  FEASIBILITY  OF THE PRODUCTS UNDER
DEVELOPMENT  HAD  NOT  BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO FURTHER ALTERNATIVE USES EXISTED.
THE  VALUE  OF  IN-PROCESS  TECHNOLOGY  WAS  CALCULATED  BY IDENTIFYING RESEARCH
PROJECTS  IN AREAS FOR WHICH TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED,
ESTIMATING  THE  COSTS  TO  DEVELOP  THE  PURCHASED  IN  PROCESS TECHNOLOGY INTO
COMMERCIALLY  VIABLE PRODUCTS, ESTIMATING THE RESULTING NET CASH FLOWS FROM SUCH
PRODUCTS,  DISCOUNTING  THE  NET  CASH  FLOWS TO PRESENT VALUE, AND APPLYING THE
REDUCED  PERCENTAGE  COMPLETION OF THE PROJECTS THERETO.  THE DISCOUNT RATE USED
IN  THE  ANALYSIS  WAS  19%  AND  WAS  BASED ON THE RISK PROFILE OF THE ACQUIRED
ASSETS.

PURCHASED  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS RELATED TO ELECTRICAL MOTOR SYSTEMS
USED IN OUR FLOW GENERATOR DEVICES AND OTHER MEDICAL AND DATA STORAGE EQUIPMENT.
KEY  ASSUMPTIONS  USED IN THE ANALYSIS INCLUDED GROSS MARGINS OF 34%.  AS OF THE
DATE  OF  ACQUISITION,  NEW  MOTOR  SYSTEMS  FOR  USE  IN  MEDICAL  AND  HEALTH
APPLICATIONS  WERE  EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED AND COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE BY 2004.
THESE  PROJECTS  HAVE  ESTIMATED  COSTS TO COMPLETE TOTALLING APPROXIMATELY $0.5
MILLION.

WE  BELIEVE  THAT  THE  ASSUMPTIONS USED TO VALUE THE ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
WERE REASONABLE AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION.  NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN, HOWEVER,
THAT  THE  UNDERLYING  ASSUMPTIONS  USED  TO ESTIMATE EXPECTED PROJECT REVENUES,
DEVELOPMENT  COSTS  OR  PROFITABILITY,  OR EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH PROJECTS,
WILL  TRANSPIRE  AS  ESTIMATED.  FOR THESE REASONS, AMONG OTHERS, ACTUAL RESULTS
MAY  VARY  FROM  THE  PROJECTED  RESULTS.

RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS  OF MAP HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS FROM FEBRUARY 16, 2001.  AN AMOUNT OF $47.1 MILLION, REPRESENTING THE
EXCESS  OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS
ACQUIRED,  HAS  BEEN  RECORDED  AS  GOODWILL.

PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF $17.7 MILLION WAS EXPENSED UPON
ACQUISITION  OF  MAP  BECAUSE  TECHNOLOGICAL  FEASIBILITY  OF THE PRODUCTS UNDER
DEVELOPMENT  HAD  NOT  BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO FURTHER ALTERNATIVE USES EXISTED.
THE  VALUE  OF  IN-PROCESS  TECHNOLOGY  WAS  CALCULATED  BY IDENTIFYING RESEARCH
PROJECTS  IN AREAS FOR WHICH TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED,
ESTIMATING  THE  COSTS  TO  DEVELOP  THE  PURCHASED  IN-PROCESS  TECHNOLOGY INTO
COMMERCIALLY  VIABLE PRODUCTS, ESTIMATING THE RESULTING NET CASH FLOWS FROM SUCH
PRODUCTS,  DISCOUNTING  THE  NET  CASH  FLOWS TO PRESENT VALUE, AND APPLYING THE
REDUCED  PERCENTAGE COMPLETION OF THE PROJECTS THERETO.  THE DISCOUNT RATES USED
IN  THE  ANALYSIS WERE BETWEEN 27% AND 33% AND WERE BASED ON THE RISK PROFILE OF
THE  ACQUIRED  ASSETS.

COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE IN 2002 AND VERSIONS OF THE AUTOTITRATING DEVICES BETWEEN
2003  AND  2005.  THESE  PROJECTS  HAD  ESTIMATED  COSTS  TO  COMPLETE TOTALLING
APPROXIMATELY  $2.0  MILLION.

WE  BELIEVE  THAT  THE  ASSUMPTIONS USED TO VALUE THE ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
WERE REASONABLE AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION.  NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN, HOWEVER,
THAT  THE  UNDERLYING  ASSUMPTIONS  USED  TO ESTIMATE EXPECTED PROJECT REVENUES,
DEVELOPMENT  COSTS  OR  PROFITABILITY,  OR EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH PROJECTS,
WILL  TRANSPIRE  AS  ESTIMATED.  FOR THESE REASONS, AMONG OTHERS, ACTUAL RESULTS
MAY  VARY  FROM  THE  PROJECTED  RESULTS.

DURING  THE  DECEMBER  2001,  WE  PAID  AN  AMOUNT  OF  $1.4  MILLION  AS  FINAL
CONSIDERATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE OF MAP.  THE AMOUNT HAS BEEN RECORDED
AS  GOODWILL.

IN-PROCESS  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT CHARGE.  ON ACQUISITION OF MAP IN FEBRUARY
2001, WE RECOGNIZED AS AN EXPENSE A CHARGE OF $17.7 MILLION WITH RESPECT TO FIVE
IN-PROCESS  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT BY MAP AT
DATE  OF  ACQUISITION.  THE  FIVE  PROJECTS  WERE:

(I)     A  SINGLE-WALLED  NASAL  CUSHION  MASK  SYSTEM
(II)    NEW  HEADGEAR  SYSTEM
(III)   STANDALONE  ACTIVE  HUMIDIFIER
(IV)    AN  AUTOTITRATION  CPAP  DEVICE  FOR  TREATMENT  OF  OSA
(V)     A  NEW  OSA  DIAGNOSTIC  DEVICE

THE  STATUS  OF  EACH  PROJECT  AS  AT  JUNE  30,  2003  IS  AS  NOTED  BELOW:

(I)     SINGLE-WALLED NASAL CUSHION - THE NASAL CUSHION UNDER DEVELOPMENT BY MAP
ON  ACQUISITION  WAS  DUE FOR RELEASE IN OCTOBER 2001.  DELAYS IN THE DESIGN AND
MANUFACTURING  PROCESS  DELAYED  THE RELEASE FOR SEVEN MONTHS, UNTIL APRIL 2002.
THE  DELAY  IN RELEASE OF THE PRODUCT WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT OVER ITS EXPECTED LIFE
CYCLE,  AND HAS MADE NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE NET RETURN ASSUMPTIONS USED IN
THE  INITIAL  IN-PROCESS  RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT  MODEL.  SINCE RELEASE, THE
PRODUCT  (NOW  REFERRED TO AS THE PAPILLON) HAS MET OR EXCEEDED SALES FORECASTS.

(II)     NEW  HEADGEAR  - THE NEW HEADGEAR PRODUCT LINE WAS WITHHELD TO COINCIDE
WITH THE RELEASE OF THE PAPILLON MASK SYSTEM IN APRIL 2002 AND SO WAS ALSO SEVEN
MONTHS  BEHIND  SCHEDULE  IN  PROJECTED  RELEASE  DATES.  SINCE RELEASE, THE NEW
HEADGEAR SYSTEM HAS EXCEEDED ORIGINAL SALES PROJECTIONS AND CONTINUES TO MEET OR
EXCEED  INITIAL  EXPECTATIONS.

(III)     STANDALONE  ACTIVE  HUMIDIFIER  -  DUE  TO OTHER PRIORITIES AND TO THE
INTRODUCTION  OF INTEGRATED HUMIDIFICATION FLOW GENERATOR DEVICES BY A NUMBER OF
COMPETITORS  DURING  FISCAL  2002,  WE  HAVE  DELAYED  THE STANDALONE HUMIDIFIER
PROJECT.

- -24-


     GIVEN  THE  RELATIVELY  SMALL  REVENUE  FORECAST OF THE PRODUCT LINE IN THE
IPR&D  MODEL,  THE  FINANCIAL  IMPACT  OF  THIS  PROJECT  IS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR
BUSINESS  OR  THE  NET  RETURN  OF  THE  MAP  ACQUISITION.

(IV)     AUTOTITRATION  CPAP DEVICE - THE MAIN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORT OF MAP
SINCE  ACQUISITION  HAS  BEEN  THE  COMPLETION  OF  THE  AUTOTITRATION CPAP FLOW
GENERATOR  SPECIFIED  IN THE INITIAL IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CHARGE.
THIS  PROJECT  EXPERIENCED  SOME  DELAYS  DUE  TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SOFTWARE
ALGORITHM  DEVELOPMENT  PROCESS  AND  ASSOCIATED  ELECTRONICS.  MAP RELEASED THE
PRODUCT  IN  NOVEMBER 2002; SINCE RELEASE, SALES OF THE PRODUCT (NOW REFERRED TO
AS  MAGELLAN)  HAVE  BEEN  WITHIN  EXPECTATIONS.

(V)     OSA  DIAGNOSTIC  DEVICE  - MAP'S NEW DIAGNOSTIC DEVICE REMAINS ON TARGET
FOR  INITIAL  MARKET  RELEASE  IN CALENDAR 2003, ALTHOUGH THE FORECASTED RELEASE
DATE OF MARCH 2003 WAS NOT ACHIEVED.  WE REMAIN CONFIDENT IN THE CAPACITY OF THE
DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM TO SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS, AND REMAIN
CONFIDENT  IN THE POTENTIAL OF THE PRODUCT TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE TREATMENT
AND  DIAGNOSIS  OF  OBSTRUCTIVE  SLEEP  APNEA  IN  THE  GERMAN  MARKET.

AS  AT  JUNE  30,  2003, THREE OF THE FIVE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED WITH THE
RELEASE  OF  THE  PAPILLON  MASK  SYSTEM,  UPGRADED  HEADGEAR  AND  THE MAGELLAN
AUTOMATED  FLOW  GENERATOR  DEVICE.  ALL  THREE  PRODUCTS  ARE  GENERATING SALES
REVENUE  CONSISTENT  WITH  OUR  ORIGINAL  EXPECTATIONS  AND  ASSUMPTIONS USED IN
CALCULATING  THE  IN-PROCESS  RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT  CHARGE.  WE  EXPECT TO
RELEASE  PRODUCTS  WITH  RESPECT  TO  BOTH  REMAINING  IN-PROCESS  RESEARCH  AND
DEVELOPMENT  PROGRAMS  OVER  THE  NEXT  TWELVE-MONTH  PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY
CONSISTENT  WITH  OUR  ORIGINAL  EXPECTATIONS.

GIVEN  THE  SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE ABOVE RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND PERFORMANCE
OF  THE ASSOCIATED PRODUCT LINES, WE REMAIN CONFIDENT IN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO
DETERMINE  THE  IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CHARGE AND, AS A RESULT, THE
NET  RETURN  OF  THE  MAP  ACQUISITION.

TAX  EXPENSE.  OUR  INCOME  TAX  RATE  IS GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE REGIONS IN
WHICH  OUR  INCOME  IS RECOGNIZED.  TO DATE, A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR INCOME
HAS  BEEN SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN AUSTRALIA WHERE THE STATUTORY RATE WAS 30% IN
FISCAL  2003 AND 2002; AND WAS 34% IN FISCAL 2001.  DURING FISCAL 2003, 2002 AND
2001,  OUR  EFFECTIVE  TAX  RATE  HAS  FLUCTUATED  BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY 31% AND
APPROXIMATELY  57%.  THESE FLUCTUATIONS HAVE RESULTED FROM, AND FUTURE EFFECTIVE
TAX  RATES  WILL DEPEND UPON, NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH
AND  DEVELOPMENT  EXPENDITURES  FOR  WHICH  A  125%  AUSTRALIAN TAX DEDUCTION IS
AVAILABLE,  THE  LEVEL  OF NON-DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES, AND THE USE OF AVAILABLE NET
OPERATING  LOSS  CARRYFORWARD  DEDUCTIONS  AND  OTHER  TAX  CREDITS  OR BENEFITS
AVAILABLE  TO  US  UNDER  APPLICABLE  TAX  LAWS.

WE  ACCOUNT FOR INCOME TAXES UNDER THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD.  DEFERRED TAX
ASSETS  AND  LIABILITIES  ARE  RECOGNIZED  FOR  THE  FUTURE  TAX  CONSEQUENCES
ATTRIBUTABLE  TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF
EXISTING  ASSETS  AND  LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES.  DEFERRED TAX
ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED TAX RATES EXPECTED TO APPLY TO
TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO
BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED.  THE EFFECT ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF A
CHANGE  IN  TAX  RATES  IS  RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE
ENACTMENT  DATE.

FISCAL  YEAR  ENDED  JUNE  30  2003,  COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30 2002

NET  REVENUES.  NET REVENUE INCREASED FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 TO $273.6
MILLION  FROM  $204.1  MILLION  FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002, AN INCREASE OF
$69.5  MILLION  OR  34%.

THE INCREASE IN NET REVENUE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN UNIT SALES OF OUR
FLOW  GENERATORS  AND ACCESSORIES.  SALES ALSO BENEFITED FROM AN APPRECIATION OF
INTERNATIONAL  CURRENCIES  AGAINST  THE  US  DOLLAR  (INCREASING  SALES  BY
APPROXIMATELY  $16.8  MILLION) AND INCLUSION OF SALES OF $6.5 MILLION FROM SERVO
MAGNETICS  INC.  (SMI),  THE SUBSIDIARY WE ACQUIRED IN MAY 2002.  NET REVENUE IN
NORTH  AND LATIN AMERICA INCREASED TO $130.7 MILLION FROM $100.9 MILLION FOR THE
YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 AND 2002 RESPECTIVELY.  THIS GROWTH PRIMARILY REFLECTS
INCREASED  PUBLIC  AND  PHYSICIAN  AWARENESS OF SLEEP-DISORDERED BREATHING.  NET
REVENUE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS INCREASED TO $142.8 MILLION FROM $103.1 MILLION
FOR  THE  YEARS  ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 AND 2002 RESPECTIVELY.  INTERNATIONAL SALES
GROWTH  FOR  THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 REFLECTS ORGANIC GROWTH IN THE OVERALL
SLEEP  DISORDERED  BREATHING  MARKET,  APPRECIATION  OF INTERNATIONAL CURRENCIES
AGAINST  THE  U.S.  DOLLAR AND SARS-RELATED SALES TO CHINA OF APPROXIMATELY $5.0
MILLION.

SALES  OF  FLOW  GENERATORS  FOR  THE  YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 INCREASED BY 29%
COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002 INCLUDING INCREASES OF 23% IN NORTH AND
LATIN  AMERICA  AND  33%  ELSEWHERE.  SALES  OF  MASK  SYSTEMS, MOTORS AND OTHER
ACCESSORIES  INCREASED  BY  40%  INCLUDING  INCREASES  OF 35% IN NORTH AND LATIN
AMERICA AND 47% ELSEWHERE, FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 COMPARED TO THE YEAR
ENDED  JUNE  30,  2002.  THESE INCREASES PRIMARILY REFLECT GROWTH IN THE OVERALL
SLEEP-DISORDERED  BREATHING  MARKET,  APPRECIATION  OF  INTERNATIONAL CURRENCIES
AGAINST  THE  U.S.  DOLLAR  AND  OUR  ACQUISITION  OF  SMI.

GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT INCREASED FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 TO $173.1
MILLION  FROM  $133.2  MILLION  FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002, AN INCREASE OF
$39.9 MILLION OR 30%.  GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE DECREASED FOR
THE  YEAR  ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 TO 63% FROM 65% FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002,
REFLECTING  THE  IMPACT  OF HIGHER MANUFACTURING COSTS RESULTING FROM A STRONGER
AUSTRALIAN  DOLLAR AGAINST THE US DOLLAR, AS THE MAJORITY OF MANUFACTURING LABOR
AND  OVERHEAD  COSTS  ARE  INCURRED  IN  AUSTRALIA  AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE
INCLUSION  OF  SMI'S  MOTOR  SALES  WHICH  ACHIEVE LOWER MARGINS COMPARED TO OUR
OVERALL  GROSS  MARGIN.

SELLING,  GENERAL  AND  ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES.  SELLING,  GENERAL  AND
ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES  INCREASED  FOR  THE  YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 TO $85.3
MILLION  FROM  $64.5  MILLION  FOR  THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002, AN INCREASE OF
$20.8  MILLION  OR  32%.  AS  A  PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, SELLING, GENERAL AND
ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES  FOR  THE  YEAR  ENDED  JUNE  30, 2003 DECREASED TO 31%
COMPARED  TO  32%  FOR  THE  YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002.  THE INCREASE IN SELLING,
GENERAL  AND  ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES  WAS  PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE
NUMBER  OF  SALES AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL AND OTHER EXPENSES RELATED TO THE
INCREASE  IN  OUR  SALES.  THE  INCREASE  IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE
EXPENSES  WAS  ALSO  ATTRIBUTABLE  TO  APPRECIATION  OF INTERNATIONAL CURRENCIES
AGAINST THE US DOLLAR (ADDING APPROXIMATELY $6.0 MILLION), THE INCLUSION OF $2.6
MILLION  FROM  SMI'S OPERATIONS, AND $2.2 MILLION IN LITIGATION COSTS ASSOCIATED
WITH  OUTSTANDING  PATENT  INFRINGEMENT  LAWSUITS  AGAINST  COMPETITORS.

RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED
FOR  THE  YEAR  ENDED  JUNE 30, 2003 TO $20.5 MILLION FROM $14.9 MILLION FOR THE
YEAR  ENDED  JUNE 30, 2002, AN INCREASE OF $5.6 MILLION OR 38%.  AS A PERCENTAGE
OF  NET  REVENUE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE 7.5% FOR THE YEAR ENDED
JUNE  30,  2003 COMPARED TO 7.3% FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002.  THE INCREASE
IN  RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WAS DUE TO INCREASED SALARIES ASSOCIATED
WITH  AN  INCREASE  IN  PERSONNEL  AND  INCREASED  CHARGES  FOR CONSULTING FEES,
CLINICAL  TRIALS AND TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS INCURRED TO FACILITATE DEVELOPMENT OF
NEW  PRODUCTS.  THE  INCREASE  ALSO  REFLECTS  AN APPRECIATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN
DOLLAR  AGAINST THE US DOLLAR, AS THE MAJORITY OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
ARE  INCURRED  IN  AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS.  IN CONSTANT CURRENCY TERMS, RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 INCREASED BY $3.1 MILLION,
OR  17%,  COMPARED  TO  THE  YEAR  ENDED  JUNE  30,  2002.

- -26-


OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET DECREASED FOR THE YEAR
ENDED  JUNE  30,  2003  TO  NET  EXPENSE OF $0.1 MILLION FROM NET INCOME OF $3.4
MILLION  FOR  THE  YEAR  ENDED  JUNE 30, 2002.  THE DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME WAS
ATTRIBUTABLE  TO  LOWER  GAINS  ON  EXTINGUISHMENT  OF  DEBT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY
INCREASED NET FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE GAINS, AND LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO
THE  REDUCTION  IN  CONVERTIBLE  NOTE  DEBT.

INCOME  TAXES.  OUR  EFFECTIVE  INCOME  TAX RATE INCREASED TO 31.9% FOR THE YEAR
ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 FROM 31.3% FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002.  THE MARGINALLY
HIGHER TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GEOGRAPHICAL MIX OF TAXABLE INCOME.  WE
CONTINUE  TO  BENEFIT  FROM THE AUSTRALIAN CORPORATE TAX RATE OF 30%, BECAUSE WE
GENERATE  A  MAJORITY  OF  OUR  TAXABLE  INCOME  IN  AUSTRALIA.


FISCAL  YEAR  ENDED  JUNE  30  2002,  COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30 2001

NET  REVENUES.  NET REVENUE INCREASED FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002 TO $204.1
MILLION  FROM  $155.2  MILLION  FOR  THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,2001, AN INCREASE OF
$48.9  MILLION  OR 32%.  THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE
IN  UNIT  SALES  OF  OUR  FLOW  GENERATORS  AND ACCESSORIES IN BOTH DOMESTIC AND
INTERNATIONAL  MARKETS  AND  THE INCLUSION OF INCREMENTAL SALES OF $17.2 MILLION
FROM  MAP MEDIZIN-TECHNOLOGIE GMBH "MAP", THE SUBSIDIARY WE ACQUIRED IN FEBRUARY
2001.

NET  REVENUE  IN  NORTH AND LATIN AMERICA INCREASED TO $100.9 MILLION FROM $79.9
MILLION  FOR  THE  YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2002 AND 2001 RESPECTIVELY.  THIS GROWTH
REFLECTS INCREASED PUBLIC AND PHYSICIAN AWARENESS OF SLEEP-DISORDERED BREATHING.
NET  REVENUE  IN  OTHER  INTERNATIONAL  MARKETS INCREASED TO $103.1 MILLION FROM
$75.2  MILLION  FOR  THE  YEARS  ENDED  JUNE  30,  2002  AND  2001 RESPECTIVELY.
INTERNATIONAL  SALES  GROWTH  FOR  THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002 REFLECTS ORGANIC
GROWTH IN THE OVERALL SLEEP-DISORDERED BREATHING MARKET AND A FULL YEAR OF SALES
FROM  OUR  SUBSIDIARY,  MAP.

SALES  OF  FLOW  GENERATORS  FOR  THE  YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002 INCREASED BY 35%
COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2001 INCLUDING INCREASES OF 22% IN NORTH AND
LATIN  AMERICA  AND  47%  ELSEWHERE.  SALES  OF  MASK  SYSTEMS, MOTORS AND OTHER
ACCESSORIES  INCREASED  BY  28%  INCLUDING  INCREASES  OF 30% IN NORTH AND LATIN
AMERICA AND 24% ELSEWHERE, FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002 COMPARED TO THE YEAR
ENDED  JUNE  30,  2002.  THESE  INCREASES  REFLECT  GROWTH  IN  THE  OVERALL
SLEEP-DISORDERED  BREATHING  MARKET  AND  OUR  ACQUISITION  OF  MAP.

GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT INCREASED FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002 TO $133.2
MILLION  FROM  $104.8  MILLION  FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2001, AN INCREASE OF
$28.5  MILLION OR 27%.  GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE DECLINED FOR
THE  YEAR  ENDED JUNE 30, 2002 TO 65% FROM 68% FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2001.
THE  DECLINE IN GROSS MARGINS REFLECTS A CHANGE IN GEOGRAPHICAL SALES MIX, OTHER
THAN  MAP  SALES,  WITH  A RELATIVELY HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF DOMESTIC SALES, WHICH
ACHIEVE  LOWER  MARGINS,  COMPARED  TO  INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.  THE DECLINE ALSO
REFLECTS  THAT  GROSS  MARGINS IN OUR ACQUIRED SUBSIDIARY, MAP, ARE HISTORICALLY
LOWER  THAN  THE  AVERAGE  MARGINS  ACHIEVED  BY  OUR  COMPANY  AS  A  WHOLE.

SELLING,  GENERAL  AND  ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES.  SELLING,  GENERAL  AND
ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES  INCREASED  FOR  THE  YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002 TO $64.5
MILLION  FROM  $49.4  MILLION  FOR  THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2001, AN INCREASE OF
$15.1  MILLION  OR  31%.  AS  A  PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, SELLING, GENERAL AND
ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES  FOR  THE  YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002 WAS 32%, CONSISTENT
WITH  THE  YEAR  ENDED  JUNE  30,  2001.  THE  INCREASE  IN SELLING, GENERAL AND
ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES  WAS  PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE ADDITION OF 98 PERSONNEL IN
SALES  AND  ADMINISTRATION  AND  OTHER  EXPENSES  RELATED TO THE INCREASE IN OUR
SALES.  SG&A IN FISCAL 2002 ALSO INCLUDED A PROVISION OF $1.0 MILLION AGAINST AN
OUTSTANDING  RECEIVABLE  FROM  AMERICAN  HOME  PATIENT INC. (AHP), A SIGNIFICANT
CUSTOMER,  WHO  FILED  FOR  CHAPTER  11  BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION ON JULY 31, 2002.
AHP'S  FILING FOR CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IS NOT EXPECTED TO MATERIALLY
IMPACT  OUR  BUSINESS.

- -27-


PROVISION  FOR  RESTRUCTURE.  IN THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2001, SUBSEQUENT TO THE
PURCHASE OF MAP, WE RESTRUCTURED MAP'S UNPROFITABLE FRENCH ACTIVITIES AND TOOK A
CHARGE  OF  $0.6  MILLION  ASSOCIATED  WITH THEIR CLOSURE.  WE DID NOT INCUR ANY
RESTRUCTURE  CHARGES  FOR  THE  YEAR  ENDED  JUNE  30,  2002.

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WRITE-OFF.  IN THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002,
PURCHASED IN- PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF $0.4 MILLION WAS EXPENSED UPON
THE  ACQUISITION  OF SMI BECAUSE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE PRODUCTS UNDER
DEVELOPMENT  HAD  NOT  BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO FURTHER ALTERNATIVE USES EXISTED.
IN  THE  YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2001, PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
OF  $17.7  MILLION  WAS  EXPENSED  UPON  ACQUISITION  OF  MAP.

DONATIONS  TO  FOUNDATIONS.  IN  THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002, WE COMMITTED $2.3
MILLION  TO  THE  ESTABLISHMENT  OF  TWO  RESMED  SLEEP  DISORDERED  BREATHING
FOUNDATIONS,  ONE  IN  THE UNITED STATES AND ONE IN AUSTRALIA.  THE FOUNDATIONS'
OVERALL  MISSION IS TO EDUCATE BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PHYSICIANS ABOUT THE INHERENT
DANGERS  OF UNTREATED SDB/OSA, PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO CEREBROVASCULAR AND
CARDIOVASCULAR  DISEASE.

RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED
IN  FISCAL  2002 TO $14.9 MILLION FROM $11.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,
2001,  AN  INCREASE  OF  $3.8  MILLION  OR 34%.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE,
RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED TO 7.3% FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,
2002  COMPARED TO 7.2% IN FISCAL 2001.  THE INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
EXPENSES  WAS DUE TO INCREASED SALARIES ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN PERSONNEL
AND  INCREASED  CHARGES  FOR  CONSULTING  FEES,  CLINICAL  TRIALS  AND TECHNICAL
ASSESSMENTS  INCURRED  TO  FACILITATE  DEVELOPMENT  OF  NEW  PRODUCTS,  AND ALSO
INCLUDES  RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT  EXPENDITURES  OF  MAP.

OTHER  INCOME  (EXPENSE).  OTHER  INCOME  (EXPENSE), NET, INCREASED FOR THE YEAR
ENDED  JUNE  30,  2002,  TO A NET INCOME OF $3.4 MILLION FROM NET INCOME OF $1.3
MILLION  FOR  THE  YEAR  ENDED  JUNE  30,  2001.  THE  INCREASE  IN OTHER INCOME
PRIMARILY  REFLECTS  A  GAIN ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OF $6.5 MILLION PARTIALLY
OFFSET  BY  INCREASED NET INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CONVERTIBLE NOTES
AND  FOREIGN  EXCHANGE  LOSSES.

INCOME TAXES.  OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE DECLINED TO APPROXIMATELY 31.3% FOR
THE  YEAR  ENDED JUNE 30, 2002, FROM APPROXIMATELY 57.4% FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE
30,  2001.  THE  LOWER  TAX  RATE IS A COROLLARY OF THE  HIGH EFFECTIVE TAX RATE
IN FISCAL 2001. THE HIGH EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2001 WAS
PRIMARILY  DUE TO NON-DEDUCTIBLE  EXPENSES OF $17.7  MILLION FOR  AN  IN-PROCESS
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  WRITE-DOWN  AND $0.6 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.
TO A  LESSER EXTENT, THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ALSO REFLECTS THE  LOWERING OF
THE  CORPORATE  INCOME  TAX  RATE  IN  AUSTRALIA  FROM   34%  TO  30%  EFFECTIVE
JULY 1, 2001.  WE  ALSO  BENEFIT  FROM A  125%  TAX DEDUCTION  ON  RESEARCH  AND
DEVELOPMENT  EXPENDITURES IN AUSTRALIA, WHICH  FURTHER  REDUCES  THE   EFFECTIVE
TAX  RATE  ON  AUSTRALIAN  SOURCED  INCOME.


LIQUIDITY  AND  CAPITAL  RESOURCES

AS  OF  JUNE  30,  2003  AND JUNE 30, 2002, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND
MARKETABLE  SECURITIES  AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE  OF  APPROXIMATELY $121.0 MILLION AND
$92.8  MILLION,  RESPECTIVELY.  WORKING  CAPITAL APPROXIMATED $191.3 MILLION AND
$142.8  MILLION  AT  JUNE  30,  2003  AND  JUNE  30,  2002  RESPECTIVELY.

- -28-


INVENTORIES  AT  JUNE 30, 2003 INCREASED BY $8.2 MILLION OR 20% TO $49.4 MILLION
COMPARED TO JUNE 30, 2002 INVENTORIES OF $41.2 MILLION.  THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE
IN  INVENTORIES  WAS  LESS  THAN THE 34% INCREMENTAL INCREASE IN REVENUES IN THE
YEAR  ENDED  JUNE  30,  2003  COMPARED  TO  THE  YEAR  ENDED JUNE 30, 2002.  THE
IMPROVEMENT  REFLECTS  BETTER  INVENTORY  MANAGEMENT  PRACTICES  AND VERY STRONG
FOURTH  QUARTER SALES.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT JUNE 30, 2003 WERE $56.7 MILLION,
AN  INCREASE  OF $10.5 MILLION OR 23% OVER THE JUNE 30, 2002 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
BALANCE  OF  $46.2  MILLION.  THIS  INCREASE  WAS LOWER THAN THE 34% INCREMENTAL
INCREASE IN REVENUES FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED
JUNE  30,  2002,  REFLECTING  IMPROVED  COLLECTIONS.  ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE  DAYS
OUTSTANDING IMPROVED TO 62 DAYS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2003, COMPARED TO
72  DAYS  FOR  THE  QUARTER  ENDED JUNE 30, 2002.  THE IMPROVEMENT REFLECTED, IN
PART,  SARS-RELATED SALES TO CHINA OF $5.0 MILLION IN THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30,
2003,  WHICH  WERE  COLLECTED  PRIOR  TO  JUNE  30,  2003.

DURING  THE  YEAR  ENDED  JUNE 30, 2003, WE GENERATED CASH OF $59.3 MILLION FROM
OPERATIONS,  PRIMARILY  AS  A  RESULT  OF  INCREASED PROFIT AND IMPROVED WORKING
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, PARTICULARLY IN RESPECT OF INVENTORIES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.
DURING  THE  YEAR  ENDED  JUNE  30, 2002 APPROXIMATELY $35.6 MILLION OF CASH WAS
GENERATED  BY  OPERATIONS.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 AND 2002 AGGREGATED $25.6
MILLION  AND  $28.2  MILLION RESPECTIVELY.  THE MAJORITY OF THE EXPENDITURES FOR
THE  YEAR  ENDED  JUNE  30,  2003  RELATED  TO  THE  CONSTRUCTION  OF  OUR  NEW
MANUFACTURING  FACILITY, ACQUISITION OF COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE INCLUDING
A  DISASTER  RECOVERY  SYSTEM, AND PURCHASE OF PRODUCTION TOOLING AND EQUIPMENT.
THE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002 PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE
PURCHASE  OF LAND IN SYDNEY DESCRIBED BELOW AND A COMPUTER SYSTEM UPGRADE.  AS A
RESULT  OF  THESE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, OUR BALANCE SHEET REFLECTS NET PROPERTY,
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $104.7 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2003 COMPARED TO
$79.3  MILLION  AT  JUNE  30,  2002.

DURING  THE  YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 WE REPURCHASED $10.0 MILLION FACE VALUE OF
OUR OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES.  THE TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE OF THE
NOTES  WAS  $9.4  MILLION,  INCLUDING  $0.2  MILLION  IN  ACCRUED  INTEREST.  WE
RECOGNIZED  A  GAIN  OF  $0.3  MILLION,  NET  OF  TAX  OF $0.2 MILLION, ON THESE
TRANSACTIONS.  AT  JUNE  30,  2003,  WE  HAD  CONVERTIBLE  SUBORDINATED  NOTES
OUTSTANDING  OF  $113.2  MILLION.

DURING  THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2002, WE REPURCHASED $56.8 MILLION FACE VALUE OF
OUR  CONVERTIBLE  SUBORDINATED NOTES.  THE TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE OF THE NOTES WAS
$49.1 MILLION, INCLUDING $0.6 MILLION IN ACCRUED INTEREST.  WE RECOGNIZED A GAIN
OF  $4.0  MILLION,  NET  OF  TAX  OF  $2.5  MILLION,  ON  THESE  TRANSACTIONS.

WE  MAY  FROM  TIME  TO  TIME  SEEK TO RETIRE OUR CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES
THROUGH  CASH  PURCHASES  AND/OR  EXCHANGES FOR EQUITY SECURITIES IN OPEN MARKET
PURCHASES, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, OR OTHERWISE.  SUCH REPURCHASES OR
EXCHANGES,  IF  ANY,  WILL DEPEND ON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR LIQUIDITY
REQUIREMENTS,  AND  OUR  CURRENT OR FUTURE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, IF ANY, THAT
MAY  DIRECTLY  OR  INDIRECTLY  APPLY  TO  SUCH  TRANSACTIONS.

ON  JULY  3,  2001,  WE  ISSUED  $30.0  MILLION  IN  OVER  ALLOTMENTS FOR OUR 4%
CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES ISSUE, INCREASING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CONVERTIBLE
SUBORDINATED  NOTES  THEN  OUTSTANDING  TO  $180.0  MILLION.

ON  OCTOBER 2, 2001, WE PAID $1.4 MILLION AS FINAL CONSIDERATION ASSOCIATED WITH
THE  PURCHASE  OF  MAP  ON  FEBRUARY  16, 2001.  THE AMOUNT HAS BEEN RECORDED AS
GOODWILL.

- -29-


ON  NOVEMBER  15,  2001, WE ACQUIRED ALL OF THE COMMON STOCK OF LABHARDT AG, OUR
SWISS DISTRIBUTOR, FOR TOTAL CASH CONSIDERATION, INCLUDING ACQUISITION COSTS, OF
$5.5  MILLION.  THE  ACQUISITION  HAS  BEEN  ACCOUNTED  FOR  AS  A PURCHASE AND,
ACCORDINGLY,  THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF LABHARDT AG HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR
CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  FROM  NOVEMBER 15, 2001.  THE EXCESS OF THE
PURCHASE  PRICE  OVER  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS ACQUIRED OF
$1.3  MILLION  HAS  BEEN  RECORDED  AS  GOODWILL.

ON APRIL 26, 2002, WE SETTLED OUR PURCHASE OF A 30-ACRE SITE AT NORWEST BUSINESS
PARK,  LOCATED  NORTHWEST  OF SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.  THE ACQUISITION COST WAS $23.6
MILLION,  INCLUDING  DEFERRED  PAYMENTS OF $5.7 MILLION PAID IN OCTOBER 2002 AND
$5.7  MILLION PAID IN APRIL 2003.  WE EXPECT THE FIRST BUILDING, A MANUFACTURING
FACILITY,  TO  BE  OPERATIONAL  ON THIS SITE IN THE FIRST HALF OF CALENDAR 2004.
NEW  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND OFFICE FACILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED
IN  2005.
WE  ESTIMATE  THAT  THE  BUILDING  COSTS  WILL  BE  APPROXIMATELY $40.0 MILLION.

ON  MAY 8, 2002, WE COMPLETED A SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTION OF OUR AUSTRALIAN
FACILITY  LOCATED AT NORTH RYDE IN SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA.  THE PROPERTY WAS SOLD FOR
$18.5  MILLION  WITH  A THREE-YEAR LEASEBACK AND A FURTHER ONE-YEAR OPTION.  THE
PROFIT BEFORE TAX ON SALE OF THE PROPERTY OF $5.5 MILLION WILL BE AMORTIZED OVER
THE  LEASE  PERIOD.  THE  CASH MADE AVAILABLE FROM THE SALE WILL BE UTILIZED FOR
THE  CONSTRUCTION OF OUR NEW FACILITIES AT NORWEST BUSINESS PARK ALSO LOCATED IN
SYDNEY,  AUSTRALIA.

ON  MAY  14,  2002  WE  ACQUIRED  ALL  OF  THE  COMMON  STOCK OF SERVO MAGNETICS
INCORPORATED  ("SMI")  FOR  TOTAL CONSIDERATION, INCLUDING ACQUISITION COSTS, OF
$32.6  MILLION.  CONSIDERATION  INCLUDED  THE  ISSUE  OF 853,448 SHARES FOR FAIR
VALUE  OF  $24.8 MILLION, WITH THE BALANCE OF THE ACQUISITION COST PAID IN CASH.
SUBSEQUENT  TO THE ACQUISITION, WE REPAID ALL SMI'S EXISTING BANK LOANS TOTALING
$3.0  MILLION.  THE  ACQUISITION  HAS  BEEN  ACCOUNTED  FOR  AS  A  PURCHASE AND
ACCORDINGLY,  THE  RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS  OF  SMI  HAVE  BEEN  INCLUDED IN OUR
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM MAY 14, 2002.  THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE
PRICE  OVER  THE  FAIR  VALUE  OF  THE  NET IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS ACQUIRED OF $1.9
MILLION  HAS  BEEN  RECORDED  AS  GOODWILL.

ON  JUNE  6,  2002, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED US TO REPURCHASE UP TO 4.0
MILLION  SHARES  OF  OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK.  FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30,
2003  AND  2002,  WE  REPURCHASED  125,000  AND 290,000 SHARES AT A COST OF $3.5
MILLION  AND $7.9 MILLION RESPECTIVELY.  WE MAY CONTINUE TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF
OUR  COMMON  STOCK  FOR  CASH  IN  THE  OPEN  MARKET,  OR IN NEGOTIATED OR BLOCK
TRANSACTIONS,  FROM  TIME  TO  TIME  AS  MARKET AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS WARRANT.

DETAILS  OF  CONTRACTUAL  OBLIGATIONS  AT  JUNE  30,  2003  ARE  AS  FOLLOWS:



(1) The  figure  includes  unconditional purchase  obligations  of $30.0 million
    relating to  the construction of our manufacturing and warehouse facility at
    Norwest  in  Sydney,  Australia.

Details  of  other  commercial  commitments  at  June  30,  2003 are as follows:



*THE  ABOVE GUARANTEES RELATE TO GUARANTEES REQUIRED BY STATUTORY AUTHORITIES AS
A  PRE-REQUISITE  TO  DEVELOPING  OUR  SITE  AT  NORWEST  AND REQUIREMENTS UNDER
CONTRACTUAL  OBLIGATIONS  WITH  INSURANCE  COMPANIES TRANSACTING WITH OUR GERMAN
SUBSIDIARIES.

THE  RESULTS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE
RATES  BETWEEN  CURRENCIES.  CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR
CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE AND GROSS PROFIT MARGINS FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.
WE  ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT THE DOLLAR VALUE EQUIVALENT OF ANTICIPATED CASH
FLOWS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.
WE  MANAGE  THIS  RISK  THROUGH  FOREIGN  CURRENCY  OPTION  CONTRACTS.

WE  EXPECT TO SATISFY ALL OF OUR SHORT TERM AND LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS
THROUGH  A  COMBINATION  OF  CASH  ON HAND, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND A
$15.0  MILLION  UNDRAWN  REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT WITH UNION BANK OF CALIFORNIA.


CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING  PRINCIPLES  AND  ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES
AND  JUDGMENTS  THAT  AFFECT  OUR  REPORTED  AMOUNTS  OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES,
REVENUES  AND  EXPENSES  AND  RELATED  DISCLOSURES  OF  CONTINGENT  ASSETS  AND
LIABILITIES.  ON  AN  ONGOING  BASIS  WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE
RELATED  TO  ALLOWANCE  FOR  DOUBTFUL  ACCOUNTS,  INVENTORY  RESERVES,  WARRANTY
OBLIGATIONS,  GOODWILL,  IMPAIRED  ASSETS,  INTANGIBLE  ASSETS, INCOME TAXES AND
CONTINGENCIES.

WE  STATE THESE ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN THE NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
AT  RELEVANT  SECTIONS IN THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  THE ESTIMATES ARE BASED
ON  THE  INFORMATION  THAT  IS  CURRENTLY  AVAILABLE  TO US AND ON VARIOUS OTHER
ASSUMPTIONS  THAT  WE  BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.  ACTUAL
RESULTS  COULD  VARY  FROM  THOSE  ESTIMATES  UNDER  DIFFERENT  ASSUMPTIONS  OR
CONDITIONS.

WE  BELIEVE  THAT  THE  FOLLOWING  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AFFECT THE MORE
SIGNIFICANT  JUDGMENTS  AND  ESTIMATES  USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS:

(1)  ALLOWANCE  FOR  DOUBTFUL  ACCOUNTS.  WE  MAINTAIN AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL
ACCOUNTS  FOR  ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO
MAKE  REQUIRED  PAYMENTS,  WHICH  RESULTS IN BAD DEBT EXPENSE.  WE DETERMINE THE
ADEQUACY  OF  THIS  ALLOWANCE  BY  CONTINUALLY  EVALUATING  INDIVIDUAL  CUSTOMER
RECEIVABLES,  CONSIDERING  A  CUSTOMER'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, CREDIT HISTORY AND
CURRENT  ECONOMIC  CONDITIONS.  IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WERE
TO  DETERIORATE,  RESULTING  IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS,
ADDITIONAL  ALLOWANCES  MAY  BE  REQUIRED.

(2)  INVENTORY  ADJUSTMENTS.   INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT LOWER OF COST OR MARKET
AND  ARE DETERMINED BY THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD.  WE REVIEW THE COMPONENTS
OF  INVENTORY  ON  A  REGULAR  BASIS FOR EXCESS, OBSOLETE AND IMPAIRED INVENTORY
BASED  ON  ESTIMATED  FUTURE  USAGE  AND  SALES.  THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANY MATERIAL
INVENTORY  WRITE-DOWNS  IS  DEPENDENT  ON CHANGES IN COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS, NEW
PRODUCT  INTRODUCTIONS  BY  US  OR OUR COMPETITORS, OR RAPID CHANGES IN CUSTOMER
DEMAND.

(3)  VALUATION  OF  GOODWILL,  INTANGIBLE  AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS.   WE USE
ASSUMPTIONS  IN  ESTABLISHING THE CARRYING VALUE, FAIR VALUE AND ESTIMATED LIVES
OF  OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL.  THE CRITERIA USED FOR THESE EVALUATIONS
INCLUDE  MANAGEMENT'S  ESTIMATE  OF  THE  ASSET'S CONTINUING ABILITY TO GENERATE
POSITIVE  INCOME  FROM  OPERATIONS  AND  POSITIVE  CASH  FLOW  IN FUTURE PERIODS
COMPARED  TO  THE  CARRYING  VALUE  OF  THE  ASSET,  AS  WELL  AS  THE STRATEGIC
SIGNIFICANCE  OF  ANY  IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSET IN OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.
IF ASSETS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT RECOGNIZED IS THE AMOUNT
BY  WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS.
USEFUL  LIVES  AND RELATED AMORTIZATION OR DEPRECIATION EXPENSE ARE BASED ON OUR
ESTIMATE  OF  THE  PERIOD THAT THE ASSETS WILL GENERATE REVENUES OR OTHERWISE BE
USED  BY  US.
FACTORS THAT WOULD INFLUENCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A MATERIAL CHANGE IN OUR REPORTED
RESULTS  INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE ASSET'S ABILITY TO GENERATE POSITIVE
CASH  FLOW, LOSS OF LEGAL OWNERSHIP OR TITLE TO THE ASSET, A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE
IN  THE  ECONOMIC  AND  COMPETITIVE  ENVIRONMENT  ON  WHICH  THE  ASSET DEPENDS,
SIGNIFICANT  CHANGES  IN  OUR  STRATEGIC BUSINESS OBJECTIVES, UTILIZATION OF THE
ASSET,  AND  A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE ECONOMIC AND/OR POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN
CERTAIN  COUNTRIES.

- -31-


(4)  VALUATION OF DEFERRED INCOME TAXES.   VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED,
WHEN  NECESSARY,  TO  REDUCE  DEFERRED  TAX  ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT EXPECTED TO BE
REALIZED.  THE  LIKELIHOOD  OF  A MATERIAL CHANGE IN OUR EXPECTED REALIZATION OF
THESE  ASSETS  IS  DEPENDENT ON FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, OUR ABILITY TO DEDUCT TAX
LOSS  CARRYFORWARDS  AGAINST FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR TAX
PLANNING  AND STRATEGIES AMONG THE VARIOUS TAX JURISDICTIONS THAT WE OPERATE IN,
AND  ANY  SIGNIFICANT  CHANGES  IN  THE  TAX  TREATMENT RECEIVED ON OUR BUSINESS
COMBINATIONS.

(5)  PROVISION  FOR  WARRANTY.   WE  PROVIDE  FOR  THE ESTIMATED COST OF PRODUCT
WARRANTIES  AT  THE  TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED.  THE AMOUNT OF THIS
PROVISION  IS  DETERMINED  BY  USING  A  FINANCIAL  MODEL,  WHICH  TAKES  INTO
CONSIDERATION  ACTUAL,  HISTORICAL  EXPENSES AND POTENTIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH
OUR  DIFFERENT  PRODUCTS.  THIS  FINANCIAL  MODEL  IS THEN USED TO CALCULATE THE
FUTURE  PROBABLE  EXPENSES  RELATED  TO  WARRANTY  AND THE REQUIRED LEVEL OF THE
WARRANTY  PROVISION.  ALTHOUGH  WE  ENGAGE  IN  PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS AND
PROCESSES,  OUR  WARRANTY  OBLIGATION  IS  AFFECTED BY PRODUCT FAILURE RATES AND
COSTS INCURRED TO CORRECT THOSE PRODUCT FAILURES.  SHOULD ACTUAL PRODUCT FAILURE
RATES  OR  ESTIMATED  COSTS  TO  REPAIR  THOSE  PRODUCT FAILURES DIFFER FROM OUR
ESTIMATES,  REVISIONS  TO  OUR  ESTIMATED  WARRANTY PROVISION WOULD BE REQUIRED.

(6)  REVENUE  RECOGNITION.  REVENUE  ON PRODUCT SALES IS RECORDED AT THE TIME OF
SHIPMENT,  AT  WHICH  TIME  TITLE TRANSFERS TO THE CUSTOMER.  REVENUE ON PRODUCT
SALES  WHICH  REQUIRE  CUSTOMER  ACCEPTANCE  IS NOT RECORDED UNTIL ACCEPTANCE IS
RECEIVED.  ROYALTY  REVENUE  FROM  LICENSE  AGREEMENTS  IS RECORDED WHEN EARNED.
SERVICE REVENUE RECEIVED IN ADVANCE FROM SERVICE CONTRACTS IS INITIALLY DEFERRED
AND  RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE LIFE OF THE SERVICE CONTRACT.  REVENUE RECEIVED
IN  ADVANCE  FROM  RENTAL  UNIT  CONTRACTS  IS INITIALLY DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED
RATABLY  OVER  THE  LIFE OF THE RENTAL CONTRACT.  REVENUE FROM SALE OF MARKETING
AND  DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS IS INITIALLY DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED RATABLY AS REVENUE
OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACT.  FREIGHT CHARGES BILLED TO CUSTOMERS ARE INCLUDED
IN  REVENUE.  ALL  FREIGHT-RELATED  EXPENSES  ARE  CHARGED  TO  COST  OF  SALES.

WE  DO NOT OFFER A RIGHT OF RETURN OR OTHER RECOURSE WITH RESPECT TO THE SALE OF
OUR  PRODUCTS  OR  SIMILARLY OFFER VARIABLE SALE PRICES FOR SUBSEQUENT EVENTS OR
ACTIVITIES.  HOWEVER,  AS  PART  OF  OUR  SALES PROCESSES WE MAY PROVIDE UPFRONT
DISCOUNTS  FOR  LARGE  ORDERS,  ONE  TIME SPECIAL PRICING TO SUPPORT NEW PRODUCT
INTRODUCTIONS, SALES REBATES FOR CENTRALIZED PURCHASING ENTITIES OR PRICE-BREAKS
FOR  REGULAR  ORDER  VOLUMES.  THE COSTS OF ALL SUCH PROGRAMS ARE RECORDED AS AN
ADJUSTMENT  TO  REVENUE.  IN  OUR  DOMESTIC  SALES ACTIVITIES WE USE A NUMBER OF
MANUFACTURER  REPRESENTATIVES  TO  SELL OUR PRODUCTS.  THESE REPRESENTATIVES ARE
PAID  A  DIRECT  COMMISSION  ON  SALES  AND  ACT AS AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF OUR
DOMESTIC SALES FORCE.  WE DO NOT SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO THESE REPRESENTATIVES, AND
DO  NOT  RECOGNIZE  REVENUE  ON  SUCH SHIPMENTS.  OUR PRODUCTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY
THERAPY  BASED  EQUIPMENT  AND  REQUIRE  NO  INSTALLATION.  AS  SUCH, WE HAVE NO
SIGNIFICANT  INSTALLATION  OBLIGATIONS.

RECENTLY  ISSUED  ACCOUNTING  PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN  MAY 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") ISSUED STATEMENT
OF  FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD ("SFAS") 150, ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS  WITH  CHARACTERISTICS  OF  BOTH  LIABILITIES  AND EQUITY.  SFAS 150
REQUIRES  THAT CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WHICH UNDER PREVIOUS GUIDANCE WERE
ACCOUNTED  FOR  AS  EQUITY,  MUST  NOW  BE  ACCOUNTED  FOR  AS LIABILITIES.  THE
FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS  AFFECTED  INCLUDE  MANDATORY  REDEEMABLE  STOCK, CERTAIN
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT REQUIRE OR MAY REQUIRE THE ISSUER TO BUY BACK SOME OF
ITS SHARES IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH OR OTHER ASSETS AND CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS THAT CAN
BE  SETTLED  WITH  SHARES  OF  STOCK.  SFAS  150  IS EFFECTIVE FOR ALL FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS  ENTERED  INTO  OR  MODIFIED  AFTER  MAY  31, 2003, AND OTHERWISE IS
EFFECTIVE  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST INTERIM PERIOD BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15,
2003.  THE COMPANY INTENDS TO ADOPT SFAS NO. 150 EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2003 AND DOES
NOT  BELIEVE  THAT  THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL  POSITION  OR  RESULTS  OF  OPERATION.

IN  APRIL  2003,  THE  FASB  ISSUED  SFAS  149,  AMENDMENT  OF  STATEMENT 133 ON
DERIVATIVE  INSTRUMENTS  AND  HEDGING  ACTIVITIES,  WHICH  AMENDS  AND CLARIFIES
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN
DERIVATIVE  INSTRUMENTS  EMBEDDED  IN OTHER CONTRACTS AND FOR HEDGING ACTIVITIES
UNDER  SFAS  133.  SFAS  149 IS EFFECTIVE FOR CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO OR MODIFIED
AFTER  JUNE  30,  2003.  THE  COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS
STATEMENT.


ITEM  7A  QUANTITATIVE  AND  QUALITATIVE  DISCLOSURES  ABOUT MARKET AND BUSINESS
RISKS

FOREIGN  CURRENCY  MARKET  RISK

OUR  FUNCTIONAL  CURRENCY  IS  THE U.S. DOLLAR, ALTHOUGH WE TRANSACT BUSINESS IN
VARIOUS  FOREIGN  CURRENCIES, INCLUDING A NUMBER OF MAJOR EUROPEAN CURRENCIES AS
WELL  AS  THE  AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR.  WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE
THROUGH  BOTH  OUR  AUSTRALIAN  MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES AND INTERNATIONAL SALES
OPERATIONS.

WE  HAVE ESTABLISHED A FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING PROGRAM USING PURCHASED CURRENCY
OPTIONS  TO HEDGE FOREIGN-CURRENCY-DENOMINATED FINANCIAL ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND
MANUFACTURING  EXPENDITURE.  THE GOAL OF THIS HEDGING PROGRAM IS TO ECONOMICALLY
GUARANTEE  OR  LOCK  IN  THE  EXCHANGE  RATES  ON OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES
DENOMINATED  IN EURO'S AND THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR.  UNDER THIS PROGRAM, INCREASES
OR  DECREASES IN OUR FOREIGN-CURRENCY-DENOMINATED FINANCIAL ASSETS, LIABILITIES,
AND  FIRM  COMMITMENTS  ARE  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE HEDGING
INSTRUMENTS.

THE  TABLE  BELOW  PROVIDES  INFORMATION  (IN  US  DOLLARS)  ON  OUR
FOREIGN-CURRENCY-DENOMINATED  FINANCIAL  ASSETS  BY  LEGAL  ENTITY  FUNCTIONAL
CURRENCY  AS  OF  JUNE  30,  2003  (IN  THOUSANDS):




THE  TABLE  BELOW  PROVIDES  INFORMATION  ABOUT  OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   AND PRESENTS THE INFORMATION IN U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENTS.
THE  TABLE  SUMMARIZES  INFORMATION  ON  INSTRUMENTS  AND  TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE
SENSITIVE  TO  FOREIGN  CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY CALL
OPTIONS  HELD  AT  JUNE  30,  2003.  THE TABLE PRESENTS THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS AND
WEIGHTED  AVERAGE  EXCHANGE  RATES BY CONTRACTUAL MATURITY DATES FOR OUR FOREIGN
CURRENCY DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  THESE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS GENERALLY ARE
USED  TO  CALCULATE  PAYMENTS  TO  BE  EXCHANGED  UNDER  THE  OPTIONS CONTRACTS.

- -33-






INTEREST  RATE  RISK

WE  ARE  EXPOSED TO RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AFFECTING THE
RETURN  ON  OUR  INVESTMENTS.

AT  JUNE  30,  2003, WE MAINTAINED A PORTION OF OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS IN
FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS  WITH  ORIGINAL  MATURITIES  OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS.  WE
MAINTAIN  A  SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONTAINING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN
WHICH  THE  MAJORITY  HAVE  ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS BUT
LESS  THAN TWELVE MONTHS.  THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, PRINCIPALLY COMPRISED OF
CORPORATE  OBLIGATIONS,  ARE  SUBJECT  TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND WILL DECLINE IN
VALUE  IF  INTEREST  RATES  INCREASE.

A HYPOTHETICAL 100 BASIS POINT CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS
ENDED JUNE 30, 2003, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION CHANGE IN
PRETAX INCOME.  IN ADDITION, THE VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES WOULD CHANGE
BY APPROXIMATELY $0.7 MILLION FOLLOWING A HYPOTHETICAL 100 BASIS POINT CHANGE IN
INTEREST  RATES.  WE  DO  NOT  USE  DERIVATIVE  FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS  IN  OUR
INVESTMENT  PORTFOLIO.


FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS

THIS  REPORT  ON  FORM  10-K  CONTAINS  OR  MAY  CONTAIN CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS  AND  INFORMATION  THAT ARE BASED ON THE BELIEFS OF OUR MANAGEMENT AS
WELL  AS  ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY, AND INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE
TO  OUR  MANAGEMENT.  THE  WORDS  "BELIEVE," "EXPECT," "ANTICIPATE," "ESTIMATE,"
"PLAN,"  "FUTURE"  AND  OTHER  SIMILAR  EXPRESSIONS  GENERALLY  IDENTIFY
FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS,  INCLUDING, IN PARTICULAR, STATEMENTS REGARDING THE
DEVELOPMENT  AND  APPROVAL  OF  NEW  PRODUCTS  AND  PRODUCT APPLICATIONS, MARKET
EXPANSION,  PENDING  LITIGATION  AND  THE  DEVELOPMENT  OF  NEW  MARKETS FOR OUR
PRODUCTS,  SUCH  AS  CARDIOVASCULAR  AND  STROKE MARKETS.  THESE FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS  ARE  MADE  PURSUANT  TO  THE  SAFE  HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE
SECURITIES  LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.  YOU ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE
RELIANCE  ON  THESE  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
REFLECT THE VIEWS OF OUR MANAGEMENT AT THE TIME SUCH STATEMENTS ARE MADE AND ARE
SUBJECT  TO  A  NUMBER  OF  RISKS,  UNCERTAINTIES,  ESTIMATES  AND  ASSUMPTIONS,
INCLUDING,  WITHOUT  LIMITATION, AND IN ADDITION TO THOSE IDENTIFIED IN THE TEXT
SURROUNDING  SUCH  STATEMENTS,  THOSE  IDENTIFIED  BELOW  AND  ELSEWHERE IN THIS
REPORT.  IN  ADDITION,  IMPORTANT  FACTORS  TO  CONSIDER  IN  EVALUATING  SUCH
FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS INCLUDE CHANGES OR DEVELOPMENTS IN SOCIAL, ECONOMIC,
MARKET,  LEGAL  OR  REGULATORY  CIRCUMSTANCES, CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS OR GROWTH
STRATEGY  OR AN INABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY DUE TO CHANGES IN OUR INDUSTRY
OR  THE  ECONOMY  GENERALLY,  THE  EMERGENCE  OF NEW OR GROWING COMPETITORS, THE
ACTIONS  OR  OMISSIONS  OF  THIRD  PARTIES,  INCLUDING  SUPPLIERS,  CUSTOMERS,
COMPETITORS  AND GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS. SHOULD ANY
ONE  OR  MORE  OF  THESE  RISKS  OR UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, OR THE UNDERLYING
ESTIMATES  OR ASSUMPTIONS PROVE INCORRECT, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY
FROM  THOSE  EXPRESSED  IN  SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, AND THERE CAN BE NO
ASSURANCE  THAT  THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT WILL IN
FACT  OCCUR.


- -34-



RISK  FACTORS

THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR
RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS  INCLUDE  THE  FOLLOWING:

OUR INABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN OUR MARKETS MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS.  THE
MARKETS  FOR  OUR SLEEP-DISORDERED BREATHING PRODUCTS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND
ARE CHARACTERIZED BY FREQUENT PRODUCT IMPROVEMENTS AND EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY.  OUR
ABILITY  TO  COMPETE  SUCCESSFULLY  DEPENDS,  IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP
INNOVATIVE  NEW PRODUCTS AND TO BE THE FIRST TO MARKET WITH THOSE PRODUCTS.  THE
DEVELOPMENT  OF  INNOVATIVE  NEW PRODUCTS BY OUR COMPETITORS OR THE DISCOVERY OF
ALTERNATIVE  TREATMENTS  OR POTENTIAL CURES FOR THE CONDITIONS THAT OUR PRODUCTS
TREAT  COULD  RESULT  IN  OUR  PRODUCTS  BECOMING  NONCOMPETITIVE  OR  OBSOLETE.
ADDITIONALLY,  SOME  OF  OUR  COMPETITORS  HAVE  GREATER FINANCIAL, RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING RESOURCES THAN WE DO.  THE PAST SEVERAL
YEARS HAVE SEEN A TREND TOWARDS CONSOLIDATION IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY AND IN
THE  MARKETS  FOR  OUR PRODUCTS.  INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION COULD RESULT IN GREATER
COMPETITION IF OUR COMPETITORS COMBINE THEIR RESOURCES OR IF OUR COMPETITORS ARE
ACQUIRED  BY OTHER COMPANIES WITH GREATER RESOURCES THAN OURS.  THIS COMPETITION
COULD  INCREASE  PRESSURE  ON US TO REDUCE THE SELLING PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR
COULD  CAUSE  US  TO INCREASE OUR SPENDING ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SALES
AND  MARKETING.  IF  WE  ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS, MAINTAIN
COMPETITIVE  PRICING,  AND  OFFER  PRODUCTS  THAT  CONSUMERS  PERCEIVE  TO BE AS
RELIABLE  AS THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS, OUR SALES OR GROSS MARGINS COULD DECREASE
WHICH  WOULD  HARM  OUR  BUSINESS.

OUR  BUSINESS  DEPENDS  ON  OUR ABILITY TO MARKET EFFECTIVELY TO DEALERS OF HOME
HEALTH  CARE  PRODUCTS  AND  SLEEP CLINICS.  WE MARKET OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO
HOME  HEALTH  CARE  DEALERS AND TO SLEEP CLINICS THAT DIAGNOSE OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP
APNEA  AND  OTHER SLEEP DISORDERS.  WE BELIEVE THAT HOME HEALTH CARE DEALERS AND
SLEEP  CLINICS  PLAY  A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DETERMINING WHICH BRAND OF PRODUCT A
PATIENT  WILL USE.  THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO MARKET
EFFECTIVELY  TO  HOME  HEALTH  CARE DEALERS AND SLEEP CLINICS TO ENSURE THAT OUR
PRODUCTS  ARE  PROPERLY  MARKETED  AND  SOLD  BY  THESE  THIRD  PARTIES.

WE  HAVE  LIMITED  RESOURCES TO MARKET TO THE MORE THAN 2,500 U.S. SLEEP CLINICS
AND  THE MORE THAN 4,000 HOME HEALTH CARE DEALER BRANCH LOCATIONS, MOST OF WHICH
USE,  SELL  OR  RECOMMEND  SEVERAL BRANDS OF PRODUCTS.  IN ADDITION, HOME HEALTH
CARE  DEALERS  HAVE  EXPERIENCED  PRICE  PRESSURES AS GOVERNMENT AND THIRD-PARTY
REIMBURSEMENT HAVE DECLINED FOR HOME CARE PRODUCTS, AND HOME HEALTH CARE DEALERS
ARE  REQUIRING  PRICE  DISCOUNTS  AND LONGER PERIODS OF TIME TO PAY FOR PRODUCTS
PURCHASED  FROM  US.  WE  CANNOT  ASSURE  YOU  THAT SLEEP CLINIC PHYSICIANS WILL
CONTINUE TO PRESCRIBE OUR PRODUCTS, OR THAT HOME HEALTH CARE DEALERS OR PATIENTS
WILL  NOT  SUBSTITUTE  COMPETING  PRODUCTS  WHEN  A  PRESCRIPTION SPECIFYING OUR
PRODUCTS  HAS  BEEN  WRITTEN.

WE  HAVE  EXPANDED  OUR  MARKETING  ACTIVITIES  TO  TARGET THE POPULATION WITH A
PREDISPOSITION TO SLEEP- DISORDERED BREATHING AS WELL AS PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS
AND  VARIOUS  MEDICAL  SPECIALISTS.  WE  CANNOT  ASSURE YOU THAT THESE MARKETING
EFFORTS  WILL  BE  SUCCESSFUL  IN  INCREASING  AWARENESS  OF  OUR  PRODUCTS.

- -35-


ANY  INABILITY  TO EFFECTIVELY MARKET OUR PRODUCTS OUTSIDE THE U.S. COULD IMPACT
OUR  PROFITABILITY.  APPROXIMATELY  HALF  OUR REVENUES ARE GENERATED OUTSIDE THE
U.S.,  IN  APPROXIMATELY  60  DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.  MANY OF THESE COUNTRIES HAVE
UNIQUE  REGULATORY,  MEDICAL,  AND  BUSINESS  ENVIRONMENTS.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO
MARKET  OUR  PRODUCTS  EFFECTIVELY  OUTSIDE  THE  U.S.,  OUR  OVERALL  FINANCIAL
PERFORMANCE  COULD  DECLINE.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUPPORT OUR CONTINUED GROWTH, OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER.  WE
HAVE  EXPERIENCED  RAPID  AND  SUBSTANTIAL  GROWTH.  AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW, THE
COMPLEXITY  OF  OUR  OPERATIONS  INCREASES,  PLACING  GREATER  DEMANDS  ON  OUR
MANAGEMENT.  OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH EFFECTIVELY DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY
TO  IMPLEMENT  AND IMPROVE OUR FINANCIAL AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS ON A
TIMELY  BASIS  AND  TO  EFFECT  OTHER  CHANGES  IN  OUR  BUSINESS.  UNEXPECTED
DIFFICULTIES  DURING  EXPANSION,  THE  FAILURE  TO  ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED
EMPLOYEES,  THE  FAILURE  TO  SUCCESSFULLY  REPLACE  OR  UPGRADE  OUR MANAGEMENT
INFORMATION  SYSTEMS,  THE  FAILURE  TO MANAGE COSTS OR OUR INABILITY TO RESPOND
EFFECTIVELY  TO  GROWTH  OR  PLAN FOR FUTURE EXPANSION COULD CAUSE OUR GROWTH TO
STOP.  IF  WE  FAIL  TO  MANAGE  OUR  GROWTH,  OUR  BUSINESS  COULD  SUFFER.

IF  WE  FAIL  TO  INTEGRATE  OUR  RECENT  ACQUISITIONS  WITH OUR OPERATIONS, OUR
BUSINESS  COULD  SUFFER.   THE  INTEGRATION  OF OUR ACQUIRED OPERATIONS REQUIRES
SIGNIFICANT  EFFORTS FROM OUR COMPANY AND THE ACQUIRED ENTITY, FOR SEVERAL YEARS
AFTER  EACH  ACQUISITION.  ALTHOUGH  WE  ACQUIRED OUR MAP SUBSIDIARY IN FEBRUARY
2001,  OUR  LABHARDT  SUBSIDIARY  IN  NOVEMBER  2001,  AND  OUR  SERVO MAGNETICS
SUBSIDIARY  IN  MAY  2002,  WE  CONTINUE  TO  ADJUST  OUR  BUSINESS  STRATEGIES,
EQUIPMENT, AND PERSONNEL TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM EFFICIENCIES AND SUCCESS.  IF WE ARE
NOT  ABLE  TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THE OPERATIONS OF OUR ACQUIRED ENTITIES, WE
MAY  NOT  FULLY  REALIZE  THE  ANTICIPATED  BENEFITS  OF  THE  ACQUISITIONS.

WE  MANUFACTURE  SUBSTANTIALLY  ALL  OF OUR PRODUCTS OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND SELL A
SIGNIFICANT  PORTION  OF  OUR  PRODUCTS  IN  NON-U.S.  MARKETS, SUBJECTING US TO
VARIOUS  RISKS  RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
OUR  OVERALL PROFITABILITY.  SALES OUTSIDE NORTH AND LATIN AMERICA ACCOUNTED FOR
APPROXIMATELY  52%,  51%, AND 48% OF OUR NET REVENUES IN FISCAL YEARS 2003, 2002
AND  2001,  RESPECTIVELY.  WE  EXPECT THAT SALES WITHIN THESE AREAS WILL ACCOUNT
FOR  APPROXIMATELY 50% OF OUR NET REVENUES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  OUR SALES
OUTSIDE  OF  NORTH  AMERICA AND OUR OPERATIONS IN EUROPE, AUSTRALIA AND ASIA ARE
SUBJECT  TO  SEVERAL  DIFFICULTIES AND RISKS THAT ARE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM
THOSE  WE  FACE  IN  OUR  DOMESTIC  OPERATIONS,  INCLUDING:

    -FLUCTUATIONS  IN  CURRENCY  EXCHANGE  RATES;
    -TARIFFS  AND  OTHER  TRADE  BARRIERS;
    -COMPLIANCE  WITH  FOREIGN  MEDICAL  DEVICE  MANUFACTURING  REGULATIONS;
    -REDUCTION  IN  THIRD  PARTY  PAYER  REIMBURSEMENT  FOR  OUR  PRODUCTS;
    -INABILITY  TO  OBTAIN  IMPORT  LICENSES;
    -CHANGES  IN  TRADE  POLICIES  AND  IN  DOMESTIC  AND  FOREIGN TAX POLICIES;
    -POSSIBLE  CHANGES  IN  EXPORT  OR  IMPORT  RESTRICTIONS;  AND
    -THE  MODIFICATION  OR  INTRODUCTION  OF  OTHER  GOVERNMENTAL  POLICIES WITH
     POTENTIALLY  ADVERSE  EFFECTS.

FLUCTUATIONS  IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD RESULT IN DECLINES IN OUR
REPORTED  SALES  AND  EARNINGS.  SINCE OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND A SIGNIFICANT
PORTION  OF  OUR MANUFACTURING COSTS ARE DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES AND NOT
IN  U.S. DOLLARS, OUR REPORTED SALES AND EARNINGS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN
FOREIGN  EXCHANGE  RATES.  WE  HAD FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION LOSSES IN RECENT
PERIODS AND MAY HAVE FURTHER LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.  WE EXPECT THAT INTERNATIONAL
SALES  WILL  CONTINUE  TO  BE  A  SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS AND THAT A
SIGNIFICANT  PORTION  OF OUR MANUFACTURING COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE DENOMINATED
IN  AUSTRALIAN  DOLLARS.

- -36-


GOVERNMENT  AND  PRIVATE  INSURANCE  PLANS  MAY  NOT  REIMBURSE PATIENTS FOR OUR
PRODUCTS,  WHICH  COULD  RESULT IN REDUCTIONS IN SALES OR SELLING PRICES FOR OUR
PRODUCTS.  OUR  ABILITY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON THE EXTENT
TO  WHICH  REIMBURSEMENT  FOR  THE  COST  OF OUR PRODUCTS WILL BE AVAILABLE FROM
GOVERNMENT  HEALTH ADMINISTRATION AUTHORITIES, PRIVATE HEALTH INSURERS AND OTHER
ORGANIZATIONS.  THESE THIRD PARTY PAYERS ARE INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING THE PRICES
CHARGED  FOR  MEDICAL  PRODUCTS  AND  SERVICES.  THEREFORE, EVEN IF A PRODUCT IS
APPROVED  FOR MARKETING, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE ALLOWED
FOR  THE  PRODUCT  OR  THAT  THE  REIMBURSEMENT  AMOUNT  WILL BE ADEQUATE OR, IF
ADEQUATE,  WILL NOT SUBSEQUENTLY BE REDUCED.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN SOME MARKETS, SUCH
AS  SPAIN,  FRANCE  AND GERMANY, GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE
FOR  PURCHASE  OR  RENTAL  OF OUR PRODUCTS BUT IS SUBJECT TO CONSTRAINTS SUCH AS
PRICE  CONTROLS  OR UNIT SALES LIMITATIONS.  IN OTHER MARKETS, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA
AND  THE  UNITED  KINGDOM,  THERE  IS  CURRENTLY LIMITED OR NO REIMBURSEMENT FOR
DEVICES  THAT TREAT SLEEP-DISORDERED BREATHING CONDITIONS.  ADDITIONALLY, FUTURE
LEGISLATION  OR REGULATION CONCERNING THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY OR THIRD PARTY OR
GOVERNMENTAL  COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT, PARTICULARLY LEGISLATION OR REGULATION
LIMITING  CONSUMERS'  REIMBURSEMENT  RIGHTS,  MAY  HARM  OUR  BUSINESS.

AS  WE  CONTINUE  TO  DEVELOP  NEW  PRODUCTS,  THOSE PRODUCTS WILL GENERALLY NOT
QUALIFY FOR REIMBURSEMENT, IF AT ALL, UNTIL THEY ARE APPROVED FOR MARKETING.  IN
THE  UNITED  STATES,  WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO HOME HEALTH CARE DEALERS
AND  TO SLEEP CLINICS.  WE DO NOT FILE CLAIMS AND BILL GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS AND
OTHER  THIRD PARTY PAYERS DIRECTLY FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR PRODUCTS.  HOWEVER,
WE  ARE  STILL  SUBJECT  TO  LAWS  AND  REGULATIONS  RELATING  TO  GOVERNMENTAL
REIMBURSEMENT  PROGRAMS,  PARTICULARLY  MEDICAID  AND  MEDICARE.

IN  PARTICULAR,  THE  FEDERAL ANTI-KICKBACK LAW PROHIBITS PERSONS FROM KNOWINGLY
AND  WILLFULLY  SOLICITING,  RECEIVING,  OFFERING  OR  PROVIDING  REMUNERATION,
DIRECTLY  OR  INDIRECTLY, TO INDUCE EITHER THE REFERRAL OF AN INDIVIDUAL, OR THE
FURNISHING,  RECOMMENDING  OR ARRANGING FOR A GOOD OR SERVICE, FOR WHICH PAYMENT
MAY BE MADE UNDER A FEDERAL HEALTHCARE PROGRAM SUCH AS THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID
PROGRAMS.  THE  GOVERNMENT  HAS  INTERPRETED  THIS  LAW  BROADLY TO APPLY TO THE
MARKETING  AND SALES ACTIVITIES OF MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS LIKE US.  MANY
STATES  AND  OTHER  GOVERNMENTS  HAVE  ADOPTED  LAWS  SIMILAR  TO  THE  FEDERAL
ANTI-KICKBACK  LAW.  WE  ARE  ALSO SUBJECT TO OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE FRAUD LAWS
APPLICABLE  TO  PAYMENT FROM ANY THIRD PARTY PAYER.  THESE LAWS PROHIBIT PERSONS
FROM  KNOWINGLY  AND  WILLFULLY  FILING  FALSE  CLAIMS  OR EXECUTING A SCHEME TO
DEFRAUD  ANY  HEALTHCARE  BENEFIT PROGRAM, INCLUDING PRIVATE THIRD PARTY PAYERS.
THESE  LAWS  MAY APPLY TO MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS WHO PROVIDE INFORMATION
ON  COVERAGE, CODING, AND REIMBURSEMENT OF THEIR PRODUCTS TO PERSONS WHO DO BILL
THIRD PARTY PAYERS.  ANY VIOLATION OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN
CIVIL  AND  CRIMINAL  PENALTIES,  INCLUDING  FINES.

COMPLYING  WITH  FOOD  AND  DRUG  ADMINISTRATION  AND  OTHER  REGULATIONS  IS AN
EXPENSIVE  AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS, AND ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY COULD RESULT IN
SUBSTANTIAL  PENALTIES.  WE  ARE  SUBJECT  TO  VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND
INTERNATIONAL  REGULATIONS REGARDING OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.  FAILURE TO COMPLY
WITH  THESE  REGULATIONS  COULD  RESULT  IN,  AMONG OTHER THINGS, RECALLS OF OUR
PRODUCTS,  SUBSTANTIAL  FINES  AND/OR  CRIMINAL  CHARGES  AGAINST  US  AND  OUR
EMPLOYEES.

PRODUCT  SALES,  INTRODUCTIONS  OR MODIFICATIONS MAY BE DELAYED OR CANCELED AS A
RESULT OF THE FDA OR SIMILAR FOREIGN REGULATIONS, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR SALES TO
DECLINE.  BEFORE  WE  CAN  MARKET  OR  SELL  A  NEW MEDICAL DEVICE IN THE UNITED
STATES,  WE MUST OBTAIN FDA CLEARANCE, WHICH CAN BE A LENGTHY AND TIME-CONSUMING
PROCESS.  WE  GENERALLY RECEIVE CLEARANCE FROM THE FDA TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS IN
THE  UNITED  STATES UNDER SECTION 510(K) OF THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC
ACT  OR  OUR  PRODUCTS  ARE  EXEMPT  FROM THE 510(K) CLEARANCE PROCESS.  WE HAVE
MODIFIED  SOME  OF  OUR  510(K)  APPROVED PRODUCTS WITHOUT SUBMITTING NEW 510(K)
NOTICES,  WHICH  WE DO NOT BELIEVE WERE REQUIRED.  HOWEVER, IF THE FDA DISAGREES
WITH  US AND REQUIRES US TO SUBMIT NEW 510(K) NOTIFICATIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS TO
OUR  EXISTING  PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO STOP MARKETING THE PRODUCTS WHILE
THE  FDA  REVIEWS  THE  510(K)  NOTIFICATION.  ANY  NEW  PRODUCT INTRODUCTION OR
EXISTING  PRODUCT  MODIFICATION COULD BE SUBJECTED TO A LENGTHIER, MORE RIGOROUS
FDA  EXAMINATION  PROCESS.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN CERTAIN CASES WE MAY NEED TO CONDUCT
CLINICAL  TRIALS  OF  A  NEW  PRODUCT  PRIOR  TO  SUBMITTING  A  510(K)  NOTICE.
ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN PREMARKET APPROVALS FOR OUR PRODUCTS.
THE  REQUIREMENTS  OF  THESE  MORE  RIGOROUS  PROCESSES  COULD  DELAY  PRODUCT
INTRODUCTIONS  AND INCREASE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FDA COMPLIANCE.  MARKETING
AND  SALE  OF  OUR  PRODUCTS  OUTSIDE  THE  UNITED  STATES  ARE  ALSO SUBJECT TO
REGULATORY  CLEARANCES  AND APPROVALS, AND IF WE FAIL TO OBTAIN THESE REGULATORY
APPROVALS,  OUR  SALES  COULD  SUFFER.

- -37-


WE  CANNOT  ASSURE  YOU  THAT  ANY NEW PRODUCTS WE DEVELOP WILL RECEIVE REQUIRED
REGULATORY  APPROVALS  FROM  U.S.  OR  FOREIGN  REGULATORY  AGENCIES.

OFF  LABEL  MARKETING  OF  OUR  PRODUCTS  COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES.
CLEARANCE  UNDER  SECTION  510(K) ONLY PERMITS US TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS FOR THE
USES  INDICATED  ON  THE LABELING CLEARED BY THE FDA.  WE MAY REQUEST ADDITIONAL
LABEL  INDICATIONS FOR OUR CURRENT PRODUCTS, AND THE FDA MAY DENY THOSE REQUESTS
OUTRIGHT,  REQUIRE  ADDITIONAL EXPENSIVE CLINICAL DATA TO SUPPORT ANY ADDITIONAL
INDICATIONS OR IMPOSE LIMITATIONS ON THE INTENDED USE OF ANY CLEARED PRODUCTS AS
A  CONDITION  OF  CLEARANCE.  IF  THE  FDA  DETERMINES THAT WE HAVE MARKETED OUR
PRODUCTS  FOR  OFF LABEL USE, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO FINES, INJUNCTIONS OR OTHER
PENALTIES.

DISRUPTIONS  IN  THE SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS FROM OUR SINGLE SOURCE SUPPLIERS COULD
RESULT  IN  A  SIGNIFICANT  REDUCTION  IN  SALES AND PROFITABILITY.  WE PURCHASE
UNIQUELY CONFIGURED COMPONENTS FOR OUR DEVICES FROM VARIOUS SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING
SOME  IN  WHICH  WE  USE  SINGLE-SOURCE  SUPPLIERS.  WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT A
REPLACEMENT  SUPPLIER  WOULD BE ABLE TO CONFIGURE ITS COMPONENTS FOR OUR DEVICES
ON  A  TIMELY BASIS OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO RECONFIGURE
OUR  DEVICES  TO  INTEGRATE  THE  REPLACEMENT  PART.  A REDUCTION OR STOPPAGE IN
SUPPLY  WHILE  A  REPLACEMENT  SUPPLIER RECONFIGURES ITS COMPONENTS, OR WHILE WE
RECONFIGURE  OUR  DEVICES  FOR  THE REPLACEMENT PART, WOULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO
MANUFACTURE  OUR DEVICES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SALES
AND  PROFITABILITY.  WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR INVENTORIES WOULD BE ADEQUATE
TO  MEET  OUR  PRODUCTION  NEEDS  DURING  ANY  PROLONGED INTERRUPTION OF SUPPLY.

OUR  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY  MAY  NOT PROTECT OUR PRODUCTS, AND OUR PRODUCTS MAY
INFRINGE  ON  THE  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES.  WE RELY ON A
COMBINATION  OF  PATENTS, TRADE SECRETS AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS TO PROTECT
OUR  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY.  OUR  SUCCESS  DEPENDS,  IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO
OBTAIN  AND  MAINTAIN  UNITED  STATES  AND  FOREIGN  PATENT  PROTECTION  FOR OUR
PRODUCTS,  THEIR  USES  AND  OUR  PROCESSES TO PRESERVE OUR TRADE SECRETS AND TO
OPERATE  WITHOUT INFRINGING ON THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES.  WE HAVE
A  NUMBER OF PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS, AND WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER ANY PATENTS
WILL  ISSUE  FROM  ANY OF THESE APPLICATIONS.  WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER ANY OF THE
CLAIMS  IN  OUR  ISSUED PATENTS OR PENDING APPLICATIONS WILL PROVIDE US WITH ANY
SIGNIFICANT PROTECTION AGAINST COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS OR OTHERWISE BE COMMERCIALLY
VALUABLE.  LEGAL  STANDARDS  REGARDING  THE  VALIDITY  OF PATENTS AND THE PROPER
SCOPE  OF  THEIR  CLAIMS  ARE  STILL EVOLVING, AND THERE IS NO CONSISTENT LAW OR
POLICY  REGARDING THE VALID BREADTH OF CLAIMS.  ADDITIONALLY, THERE MAY BE THIRD
PARTY  PATENTS,  PATENT APPLICATIONS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RELEVANT TO
OUR  PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY WHICH ARE NOT KNOWN TO US AND THAT BLOCK OR COMPETE
WITH  OUR  PRODUCTS.

WE  FACE  THE  RISKS  THAT:

  -THIRD  PARTIES  WILL  INFRINGE  OUR  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY  RIGHTS;
  -OUR  NON-DISCLOSURE  AGREEMENTS  WILL  BE  BREACHED;
  -WE  WILL  NOT  HAVE  ADEQUATE  REMEDIES  FOR  INFRINGEMENT;
  -OUR  TRADE  SECRETS  WILL BECOME KNOWN TO OR INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPED BY OUR
   COMPETITORS;  OR
  -THIRD  PARTIES  WILL  BE  ISSUED  PATENTS  THAT MAY PREVENT THE SALE OF OUR
   PRODUCTS  OR  REQUIRE US TO LICENSE AND PAY FEES OR ROYALTIES IN ORDER FOR
   US TO BE  ABLE  TO  MARKET  SOME  OF  OUR  PRODUCTS.

- -38-



WE  ARE  CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN LITIGATION RELATING TO THE ENFORCEMENT AND DEFENSE
OF  A  NUMBER OF OUR PATENTS.  ADDITIONAL LITIGATION MAY BE NECESSARY TO ENFORCE
PATENTS  ISSUED  TO  US,  TO  PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, OR TO DEFEND THIRD
PARTY  CLAIMS  THAT  WE  HAVE  INFRINGED UPON PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS.  THE
DEFENSE  AND  PROSECUTION  OF  PATENT CLAIMS, INCLUDING THESE PENDING CLAIMS, AS
WELL  AS  PARTICIPATION  IN  OTHER INTER-PARTY PROCEEDINGS, CAN BE EXPENSIVE AND
TIME CONSUMING, EVEN IN THOSE INSTANCES IN WHICH THE OUTCOME IS FAVORABLE TO US.
IF  THE OUTCOME OF ANY LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT AGAINST US WERE ADVERSE,
WE  COULD  BE  SUBJECT  TO  SIGNIFICANT  LIABILITIES  TO THIRD PARTIES, COULD BE
REQUIRED  TO  OBTAIN  LICENSES  FROM THIRD PARTIES OR COULD BE REQUIRED TO CEASE
SALES  OF  THE  AFFECTED  PRODUCTS.  ADDITIONALLY,  THE  LAWS  REGARDING  THE
ENFORCEABILITY OF PATENTS VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU
THAT  ANY  PATENT  ISSUES WE FACE WILL BE UNIFORMLY RESOLVED, OR THAT LOCAL LAWS
WILL  PROVIDE  US  WITH  CONSISTENT  RIGHTS  AND  BENEFITS.

WE  ARE  SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS THAT MAY EXCEED THE SCOPE
AND  AMOUNT  OF  OUR  INSURANCE COVERAGE, WHICH WOULD EXPOSE US TO LIABILITY FOR
UNINSURED  CLAIMS.  WE  ARE  SUBJECT  TO POTENTIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS AS A
RESULT OF THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING OF MEDICAL DEVICES.  ANY PRODUCT
LIABILITY  CLAIM  BROUGHT AGAINST US, WITH OR WITHOUT MERIT, COULD RESULT IN THE
INCREASE  OF  OUR PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE RATES.  IN ADDITION, WE WOULD HAVE
TO  PAY  ANY  AMOUNT  AWARDED  BY  A  COURT IN EXCESS OF OUR POLICY LIMITS.  OUR
INSURANCE  POLICIES  HAVE  VARIOUS  EXCLUSIONS,  AND THUS WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO A
PRODUCT  LIABILITY CLAIM FOR WHICH WE HAVE NO INSURANCE COVERAGE, IN WHICH CASE,
WE  MAY  HAVE  TO PAY THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF ANY AWARD.  WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT
OUR  INSURANCE  COVERAGE  WILL BE ADEQUATE OR THAT ALL CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US
WILL BE COVERED BY OUR INSURANCE.  INSURANCE VARIES IN COST AND CAN BE DIFFICULT
TO  OBTAIN, AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN INSURANCE IN
THE  FUTURE ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US OR AT ALL.  A SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT LIABILITY
CLAIM  BROUGHT  AGAINST  US  IN  EXCESS  OF  OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE, IF ANY, MAY
REQUIRE  US  TO  PAY  SUBSTANTIAL  AMOUNTS,  WHICH  COULD  HARM  OUR  BUSINESS.
OUR  QUARTERLY  OPERATING  RESULTS  ARE  SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION FOR A VARIETY OF
REASONS.  OUR  OPERATING  RESULTS  HAVE,  FROM  TIME  TO  TIME,  FLUCTUATED ON A
QUARTERLY BASIS AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FUTURE.  THESE
FLUCTUATIONS  MAY  RESULT  FROM  A  NUMBER  OF  FACTORS,  INCLUDING:

     -THE  INTRODUCTION  OF  NEW  PRODUCTS  BY  US  OR  OUR  COMPETITORS;
     -THE  GEOGRAPHIC  MIX  OF  PRODUCT  SALES;
     -THE  SUCCESS  OF  OUR  MARKETING  EFFORTS  IN  NEW  REGIONS;
     -CHANGES  IN  THIRD  PARTY  REIMBURSEMENT;
     -TIMING  OF  REGULATORY  CLEARANCES  AND  APPROVALS;
     -TIMING  OF  ORDERS  BY  DISTRIBUTORS;
     -EXPENDITURES  INCURRED  FOR  RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT;
     -COMPETITIVE  PRICING  IN  DIFFERENT  REGIONS;
     -SEASONALITY;
     -THE  COST  AND  EFFECT  OF  PROMOTIONAL  AND  MARKETING  PROGRAMS;
     -THE  EFFECT  OF  FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSACTION  GAINS  OR  LOSSES;  AND
     -OTHER  ACTIVITIES  OF  OUR  COMPETITORS.

- -39-


IF  A NATURAL OR MAN-MADE DISASTER STRIKES OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, WE WILL
BE  UNABLE  TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME AND OUR
SALES  WILL  DECLINE.  OUR  FACILITIES AND THE MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT WE USE TO
PRODUCE  OUR  PRODUCTS  WOULD BE COSTLY TO REPLACE AND COULD REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL
LEAD  TIME  TO  REPAIR OR REPLACE.  THE FACILITIES MAY BE AFFECTED BY NATURAL OR
MAN  MADE  DISASTERS AND IN THE EVENT IT WAS AFFECTED BY A DISASTER, WE WOULD BE
FORCED  TO  RELY  ON  THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURERS.  ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE POSSESS
ADEQUATE INSURANCE FOR DAMAGE TO OUR PROPERTY AND THE DISRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESS
FROM  CASUALTIES,  SUCH  INSURANCE  MAY  NOT  BE  SUFFICIENT TO COVER ALL OF OUR
POTENTIAL LOSSES AND MAY NOT CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE TO US ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS,
OR  AT  ALL.

DELAWARE  LAW,  PROVISIONS  IN OUR CHARTER AND OUR SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN COULD
MAKE  IT  DIFFICULT  FOR  ANOTHER  COMPANY  TO  ACQUIRE  US.  PROVISIONS  OF OUR
CERTIFICATE  OF  INCORPORATION  MAY  HAVE  THE  EFFECT OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING
CHANGES IN CONTROL OR MANAGEMENT WHICH MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL TO US OR OUR SECURITY
HOLDERS.  IN  PARTICULAR,  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS DIVIDED INTO THREE CLASSES,
SERVING  FOR STAGGERED THREE-YEAR TERMS.  BECAUSE OF THIS CLASSIFICATION IT WILL
REQUIRE  AT LEAST TWO ANNUAL MEETINGS TO ELECT DIRECTORS CONSTITUTING A MAJORITY
OF  OUR  BOARD  OF  DIRECTORS.

ADDITIONALLY,  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE UP TO 2,000,000
SHARES  OF  PREFERRED  STOCK  AND  TO  DETERMINE THE PRICE, RIGHTS, PREFERENCES,
PRIVILEGES  AND  RESTRICTIONS,  INCLUDING VOTING RIGHTS, OF THOSE SHARES WITHOUT
FURTHER  VOTE OR ACTION BY THE STOCKHOLDERS.  UNDER OUR STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN,
WE  HAVE  ALSO  ISSUED  PURCHASE  RIGHTS TO THE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK THAT
ENTITLE  THOSE  HOLDERS  TO PURCHASE OUR SERIES A JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED
STOCK  AT A DISCOUNT, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE RIGHTS OF THE HOLDERS OF
OUR  COMMON  STOCK  WILL  BE  SUBJECT  TO, AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY, THE
RIGHTS  OF  THE HOLDERS OF ANY PREFERRED STOCK THAT MAY BE ISSUED IN THE FUTURE.
THE  ISSUANCE  OF  PREFERRED STOCK MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING, DEFERRING OR
PREVENTING  A  CHANGE  IN CONTROL, MAY DISCOURAGE BIDS FOR OUR COMMON STOCK AT A
PREMIUM  OVER  THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE
MARKET  PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND THE VOTING AND OTHER RIGHTS OF THE HOLDERS
OF  OUR  COMMON  STOCK.

YOU  MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THE JUDGMENTS OF U.S. COURTS AGAINST SOME OF OUR
ASSETS  OR  OFFICERS  AND  DIRECTORS.  A  SUBSTANTIAL  PORTION OF OUR ASSETS ARE
LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.  ADDITIONALLY, TWO OF OUR SEVEN DIRECTORS AND
THREE  OF OUR SEVEN OFFICERS RESIDE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, ALONG WITH ALL OR
A  SUBSTANTIAL  PORTION OF THE ASSETS OF THESE PERSONS.  AS A RESULT, IT MAY NOT
BE  POSSIBLE  FOR  INVESTORS TO ENFORCE JUDGMENTS OF U.S. COURTS RELATING TO ANY
LIABILITIES  UNDER  U.S.  SECURITIES  LAWS  AGAINST OUR ASSETS, THOSE PERSONS OR
THEIR  ASSETS.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED BY OUR AUSTRALIAN COUNSEL THAT
SOME  DOUBT EXISTS AS TO THE ABILITY OF INVESTORS TO PURSUE CLAIMS BASED ON U.S.
SECURITIES  LAWS  AGAINST  THESE  ASSETS  OR THESE PERSONS IN AUSTRALIAN COURTS.

            NONE.


ITEM  9A  CONTROLS  AND  PROCEDURES

WE  MAINTAIN DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT
INFORMATION  REQUIRED  TO  BE DISCLOSED IN OUR EXCHANGE ACT REPORTS IS RECORDED,
PROCESSED,  SUMMARIZED  AND  REPORTED  WITHIN  THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE
SECURITIES  AND  EXCHANGE COMMISSION'S RULES AND FORMS AND THAT SUCH INFORMATION
IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER  AND  CHIEF  FINANCIAL  OFFICER,  AS  APPROPRIATE,  TO  ALLOW FOR TIMELY
DECISIONS  REGARDING  REQUIRED  DISCLOSURE.  IN  DESIGNING  AND  EVALUATING  THE
DISCLOSURE  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT ANY CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES,  NO  MATTER  HOW  WELL  DESIGNED  AND  OPERATED,  CAN  PROVIDE  ONLY
REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF ACHIEVING THE DESIRED CONTROL OBJECTIVES, AND MANAGEMENT
IS REQUIRED TO APPLY ITS JUDGMENT IN EVALUATING THE COST-BENEFIT RELATIONSHIP OF
POSSIBLE  CONTROLS  AND  PROCEDURES.

AS  REQUIRED  BY  SEC  RULE  13A-15(B),  WE CARRIED OUT AN EVALUATION, UNDER THE
SUPERVISION  AND  WITH  THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF
EXECUTIVE  OFFICER  AND  CHIEF  FINANCIAL  OFFICER,  OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE
DESIGN  AND  OPERATION  OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS OF JUNE 30,
2003.  BASED  ON  THE FOREGOING, OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL
OFFICER  CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE AT
THE  REASONABLE  ASSURANCE  LEVEL.

THERE  HAS  BEEN  NO  CHANGE  IN  OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
DURING  OUR  MOST  RECENT  FISCAL  QUARTER  THAT  HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS
REASONABLY  LIKELY  TO  MATERIALLY  AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING.

                          INDEPENDENT  AUDITORS'  REPORT



THE  BOARD  OF  DIRECTORS  AND  STOCKHOLDERS
RESMED  INC:


WE  HAVE  AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF RESMED INC AND
SUBSIDIARIES  AS  OF  JUNE  30,  2003,  AND  2002,  AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED
STATEMENTS OF INCOME, STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS
IN  THE  THREE-YEAR  PERIOD  ENDED  JUNE 30, 2003.  THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  ARE  THE  RESPONSIBILITY  OF  THE  COMPANY'S  MANAGEMENT.  OUR
RESPONSIBILITY  IS  TO  EXPRESS  AN  OPINION  ON  THESE  CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS  BASED  ON  OUR  AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUDITING STANDARDS GENERALLY ACCEPTED
IN  THE  UNITED  STATES  OF  AMERICA.  THOSE  STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND
PERFORM  THE  AUDIT  TO  OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT.  AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A
TEST  BASIS,  EVIDENCE  SUPPORTING  THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS.  AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND
SIGNIFICANT  ESTIMATES  MADE  BY  MANAGEMENT,  AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL
FINANCIAL  STATEMENT  PRESENTATION.  WE  BELIEVE  THAT  OUR  AUDITS  PROVIDE  A
REASONABLE  BASIS  FOR  OUR  OPINION.

IN  OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT
FAIRLY,  IN  ALL  MATERIAL  RESPECTS,  THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF RESMED INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES  AS  OF JUNE 30, 2003 AND 2002, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS
AND  THEIR  CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED JUNE
30,  2003,  IN  CONFORMITY  WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE
UNITED  STATES  OF  AMERICA.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS
ADOPTED  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  SFAS  NO.  42  "ACCOUNTING  FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER
INTANGIBLE  ASSETS"  AND  CHANGED  ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL IN 2002
ACCORDINGLY.

AUSTRALIA  AND  SWEDEN.


(2)     SUMMARY  OF  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES

     (A)     BASIS  OF  CONSOLIDATION

          THE  CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  INCLUDE  THE ACCOUNTS OF THE
COMPANY  AND  ITS  WHOLLY  OWNED  SUBSIDIARIES.  ALL  SIGNIFICANT  INTERCOMPANY
TRANSACTIONS  AND  BALANCES  HAVE  BEEN  ELIMINATED  ON  CONSOLIDATION.

          THE  PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING
PRINCIPLES  GENERALLY  ACCEPTED  IN  THE  UNITED  STATES  OF  AMERICA  REQUIRES
MANAGEMENT  ESTIMATES  AND  ASSUMPTIONS  THAT  AFFECT  AMOUNTS  REPORTED  IN THE
FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM
MANAGEMENT'S  ESTIMATES.

     (B)     REVENUE  RECOGNITION

REVENUE  ON  PRODUCT  SALES  IS  GENERALLY RECORDED UPON SHIPMENT, AT WHICH TIME
TITLE  TRANSFERS  TO  THE  CUSTOMER.  REVENUE  ON  PRODUCT  SALES  WHICH REQUIRE
CUSTOMER  ACCEPTANCE  IS  NOT  RECORDED  UNTIL  ACCEPTANCE IS RECEIVED.  ROYALTY
REVENUE  FROM  LICENSE  AGREEMENTS  IS  RECORDED  WHEN  EARNED.  SERVICE REVENUE
RECEIVED  IN ADVANCE FROM SERVICE CONTRACTS IS INITIALLY DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED
RATABLY OVER THE LIFE OF THE SERVICE CONTRACT.  REVENUE RECEIVED IN ADVANCE FROM
RENTAL UNIT CONTRACTS IS INITIALLY DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE LIFE
OF  THE RENTAL CONTRACT.  REVENUE FROM SALE OF MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS
IS  INITIALLY  DEFERRED  AND  RECOGNIZED RATABLY AS REVENUE OVER THE LIFE OF THE
CONTRACT.  FREIGHT  CHARGES  BILLED  TO  CUSTOMERS ARE INCLUDED IN REVENUE.  ALL
FREIGHT-RELATED  EXPENSES  ARE  CHARGED  TO  COST  OF  SALES.

WE  DO NOT OFFER A RIGHT OF RETURN OR OTHER RECOURSE WITH RESPECT TO THE SALE OF
OUR  PRODUCTS  OR  SIMILARLY OFFER VARIABLE SALE PRICES FOR SUBSEQUENT EVENTS OR
ACTIVITIES.  HOWEVER,  AS  PART  OF  OUR  SALES PROCESSES WE MAY PROVIDE UPFRONT
DISCOUNTS  FOR  LARGE  ORDERS,  ONE  TIME SPECIAL PRICING TO SUPPORT NEW PRODUCT
INTRODUCTIONS, SALES REBATES FOR CENTRALIZED PURCHASING ENTITIES OR PRICE-BREAKS
FOR  REGULAR  ORDER  VOLUMES.  THE COSTS OF ALL SUCH PROGRAMS ARE RECORDED AS AN
ADJUSTMENT  TO  REVENUE.  IN  OUR  DOMESTIC  SALES ACTIVITIES WE USE A NUMBER OF
MANUFACTURER  REPRESENTATIVES  TO  SELL OUR PRODUCTS.  THESE REPRESENTATIVES ARE
PAID  A  DIRECT  COMMISSION  ON  SALES  AND  ACT AS AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF OUR
DOMESTIC  SALES FORCE.  WE DO NOT SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO THESE REPRESENTATIVES AND
DO  NOT  RECOGNIZE  REVENUE  ON  SUCH SHIPMENTS.  OUR PRODUCTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY
THERAPY-BASED  EQUIPMENT  AND  REQUIRE  NO  INSTALLATION.  AS  SUCH,  WE HAVE NO
SIGNIFICANT  INSTALLATION  OBLIGATIONS.

     (C)     CASH  AND  CASH  EQUIVALENTS

          CASH  EQUIVALENTS  INCLUDING CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, COMMERCIAL PAPER
AND  OTHER  HIGHLY  LIQUID  INVESTMENTS  ARE  STATED AT COST, WHICH APPROXIMATES
MARKET.  INVESTMENTS  WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF 90 DAYS OR LESS ARE CONSIDERED
TO  BE  CASH  EQUIVALENTS  FOR  PURPOSES  OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH
FLOWS.

     (D)     INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES  ARE  STATED  AT  THE  LOWER  OF COST, DETERMINED PRINCIPALLY BY THE
FIRST-IN,  FIRST-OUT  METHOD,  OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE.  THE COMPANY REVIEWS AND
PROVIDES  FOR  ANY  PRODUCT  OBSOLESCENCE  IN ITS MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION
OPERATIONS  WITH  ASSESSMENTS  OF  INDIVIDUAL  PRODUCTS AND COMPONENTS (BASED ON
ESTIMATED  FUTURE  USAGE  AND  SALES)  BEING  PERFORMED  THROUGHOUT  THE  YEAR.

     (E)     PROPERTY,  PLANT  AND  EQUIPMENT

     PROPERTY,  PLANT  AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING RENTAL EQUIPMENT, IS RECORDED AT
COST.  DEPRECIATION  EXPENSE IS COMPUTED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE
ESTIMATED  USEFUL  LIVES  OF  THE  ASSETS, GENERALLY TWO TO TEN YEARS EXCEPT FOR
BUILDINGS  WHICH  ARE  DEPRECIATED  OVER  AN  ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF 40 YEARS.
STRAIGHT-LINE AND ACCELERATED METHODS OF DEPRECIATION ARE USED FOR TAX PURPOSES.
MAINTENANCE  AND  REPAIRS  ARE  CHARGED  TO  EXPENSE  AS  INCURRED.

     (F)     PATENTS

          THE  REGISTRATION  COSTS FOR NEW PATENTS ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED
OVER  THE  ESTIMATED  USEFUL  LIFE  OF THE PATENT, GENERALLY FIVE YEARS.  IN THE
EVENT  OF  A  PATENT  BEING  SUPERSEDED,  THE  UNAMORTIZED COSTS ARE WRITTEN OFF
IMMEDIATELY.

     (G)     GOODWILL

IN JULY 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") ISSUED STATEMENT
OF  FINANCIAL  ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS ("SFAS") 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE
ASSETS.  AS  ALLOWED  UNDER THE STANDARD, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS 142 EFFECTIVE
JULY  1, 2001.  SFAS 142 REQUIRES GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE
USEFUL  LIVES TO NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED, BUT INSTEAD BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT
LEAST  ANNUALLY.

WITH  THE  ADOPTION  OF  SFAS  142,  THE COMPANY REASSESSED THE USEFUL LIVES AND
RESIDUAL  VALUES  OF  ALL  ACQUIRED  INTANGIBLE  ASSETS  TO  MAKE  ANY NECESSARY
AMORTIZATION  PERIOD  ADJUSTMENTS.  BASED  ON THAT ASSESSMENT, ONLY GOODWILL WAS
DETERMINED TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE AND NO ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE TO THE
AMORTIZATION  PERIOD  OR  RESIDUAL  VALUES  OF  OTHER  INTANGIBLE  ASSETS.

THE  COMPANY  CONDUCTED  ITS ANNUAL REVIEW FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT IN JULY 2003.
IN  CONDUCTING  OUR  REVIEW  OF  GOODWILL  IMPAIRMENT,  THE  COMPANY  IDENTIFIED
REPORTING  UNITS,  BEING  COMPONENTS  OF  OUR  OPERATING SEGMENT, AS EACH OF THE
ENTITIES  ACQUIRED  AND  GIVING  RISE  TO THE GOODWILL.  THE FAIR VALUE FOR EACH
REPORTING  UNIT WAS DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND INVOLVED A TWO
STEP  PROCESS  AS  FOLLOWS:

                          RESMED  INC.  AND  SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES  TO  CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS
                             JUNE  30,  2003  AND  2002

(2)     SUMMARY  OF  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES,  CONTINUED

     (G)     GOODWILL  (CONTINUED)

STEP  1  -     COMPARE  THE  FAIR  VALUE FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING
VALUE,  INCLUDING  GOODWILL.  FOR  EACH REPORTING UNIT WHERE THE CARRYING VALUE,
INCLUDING  GOODWILL, EXCEEDS THE REPORTING UNIT'S FAIR VALUE, MOVE ON TO STEP 2.
IF  A REPORTING UNIT'S FAIR VALUE EXCEEDS THE CARRYING VALUE, NO FURTHER WORK IS
PERFORMED  AND  NO  IMPAIRMENT  CHARGE  IS  NECESSARY.

STEP  2  -     ALLOCATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS IDENTIFIABLE
TANGIBLE  AND  NON-GOODWILL INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  THIS WILL DERIVE
AN IMPLIED FAIR VALUE FOR THE GOODWILL.  THEN, COMPARE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF
THE  REPORTING  UNIT'S GOODWILL WITH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S
GOODWILL.  IF  THE  CARRYING  AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S GOODWILL IS GREATER
THAN  THE  IMPLIED  FAIR  VALUE  OF  ITS  GOODWILL,  AN  IMPAIRMENT LOSS MUST BE
RECOGNIZED  FOR  THE  EXCESS.

THE  RESULTS  OF  THE  REVIEW  INDICATED  THAT  NO  IMPAIRED  GOODWILL  EXISTS.

     (H)     GOVERNMENT  GRANTS

          GOVERNMENT  GRANTS REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN EARNED. GRANTS HAVE BEEN
OBTAINED  BY  THE  COMPANY FROM THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT THE
CONTINUED  DEVELOPMENT  OF  THE  COMPANY'S  PROPRIETARY POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE
TECHNOLOGY  AND  TO  ASSIST  DEVELOPMENT  OF  EXPORT  MARKETS.  GRANTS HAVE BEEN
RECOGNIZED IN THE AMOUNT OF $NIL, $NIL, AND $72,000 FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30,
2003,  2002  AND  2001,  RESPECTIVELY.

     (I)     FOREIGN  CURRENCY

     THE  CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  OF  THE  COMPANY'S  NON-U.S.
SUBSIDIARIES,  WHOSE  FUNCTIONAL  CURRENCIES  ARE  OTHER  THAN U.S. DOLLARS, ARE
TRANSLATED  INTO  U.S.  DOLLARS  FOR  FINANCIAL  REPORTING PURPOSES.  ASSETS AND
LIABILITIES  OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE OTHER THAN
THE  U.S.  DOLLAR  ARE  TRANSLATED  AT  YEAR END EXCHANGE RATES, AND REVENUE AND
EXPENSE  TRANSACTIONS  ARE  TRANSLATED  AT  AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES FOR THE YEAR.
CUMULATIVE  TRANSLATION  ADJUSTMENTS  ARE  RECOGNIZED  AS  PART OF COMPREHENSIVE
INCOME,  AS  DESCRIBED  IN  NOTE  17,  AND  ARE  INCLUDED  IN  ACCUMULATED OTHER
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET UNTIL SUCH TIME AS
THE  SUBSIDIARY  IS  SOLD  OR SUBSTANTIALLY OR COMPLETELY LIQUIDATED.  GAINS AND
LOSSES ON TRANSACTIONS, DENOMINATED IN OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE
ENTITY,  ARE  REFLECTED  IN  OPERATIONS.

     (J)     RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT

          RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT  COSTS ARE EXPENSED IN THE PERIOD INCURRED.

(2)     SUMMARY  OF  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES,  CONTINUED

(K)  EARNINGS  PER  SHARE

THE  WEIGHTED  AVERAGE  SHARES  USED  TO CALCULATE BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE
33,054,000,  32,174,000,  AND 31,129,000 FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2003, 2002
AND  2001,  RESPECTIVELY.  THE  DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE AND
DILUTED  EARNINGS  PER  SHARE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPACT OF OUTSTANDING STOCK
OPTIONS  DURING  THE  PERIODS  PRESENTED.  STOCK  OPTIONS  HAD  THE  EFFECT  OF
INCREASING  THE  NUMBER OF SHARES USED IN THE CALCULATION (BY APPLICATION OF THE
TREASURY STOCK METHOD) BY 1,385,000, 1,906,000 AND 2,355,000 FOR THE YEARS ENDED
JUNE  30,  2003,  2002  AND  2001,  RESPECTIVELY.

STOCK  OPTIONS  OF  1,408,000,  726,000 AND NIL FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30,
2003,  2002  AND  2001  RESPECTIVELY,  WERE  NOT  INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF
DILUTED  EARNINGS PER SHARE AS THE EFFECT OF EXERCISING THESE OPTIONS WOULD HAVE
BEEN  ANTI-DILUTIVE.

(L)  FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS

THE  CARRYING  VALUE  OF  FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS,  SUCH  AS  CASH  AND  CASH
EQUIVALENTS,  MARKETABLE  SECURITIES  - AVAILABLE FOR SALE, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE,
GOVERNMENT  GRANTS  RECEIVABLE AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE APPROXIMATE THEIR FAIR VALUE
BECAUSE  OF  THEIR SHORT-TERM NATURE.  THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S
LONG-TERM  DEBT  AT  JUNE 30, 2003 APPROXIMATES $117.3 MILLION COMPARED WITH THE
CARRYING  VALUE OF $113.3 MILLION.  FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS ARE MARKED
TO  MARKET AND THEREFORE REFLECT THEIR FAIR VALUE.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD OR
ISSUE  FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS  FOR  TRADING  PURPOSES.

THE  FAIR  VALUE  OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS DEFINED AS THE AMOUNT AT WHICH THE
INSTRUMENT  COULD BE EXCHANGED IN A CURRENT TRANSACTION BETWEEN WILLING PARTIES.

(M)  FOREIGN  EXCHANGE  RISK  MANAGEMENT

THE  COMPANY  ENTERS  INTO  VARIOUS  TYPES  OF  FOREIGN  EXCHANGE  CONTRACTS  IN
MANAGING  ITS  FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
ENCOMPASSING  FORWARD  EXCHANGE  CONTRACTS  AND  FOREIGN  CURRENCY  OPTIONS.

THE  PURPOSE  OF  THE  COMPANY'S  FOREIGN  CURRENCY  HEDGING  ACTIVITIES  IS  TO
PROTECT  THE COMPANY FROM ADVERSE EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS WITH RESPECT TO NET
CASH  MOVEMENTS  RESULTING  FROM  THE SALES OF PRODUCTS TO FOREIGN CUSTOMERS AND
AUSTRALIAN  MANUFACTURING  ACTIVITIES.  THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY
OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE ANTICIPATED SALES AND MANUFACTURING COSTS, PRINCIPALLY
DENOMINATED IN AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS AND EUROS.  THE TERMS OF SUCH FOREIGN CURRENCY
OPTION  CONTRACTS  GENERALLY  DO  NOT  EXCEED  THREE  YEARS.

THE  COMPANY'S  FOREIGN  CURRENCY  DERIVATIVES  PORTFOLIO  REPRESENTS A CASHFLOW
HEDGE  PROGRAM  AGAINST  THE  NET  CASH  FLOW OF ITS INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING
OPERATIONS.  THE  COMPANY HAS DETERMINED ITS HEDGE PROGRAM TO BE A NON-EFFECTIVE
HEDGE  AS  DEFINED  UNDER  SFAS  133.  AS SUCH, THE FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVES
PORTFOLIO  IS  RECORDED  IN  THE  CONSOLIDATED  BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE AND
INCLUDED  IN  OTHER  ASSETS  OR  OTHER  LIABILITIES.

ALL MOVEMENTS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED
WITHIN  OTHER  INCOME,  NET  ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

     (M)     FOREIGN  EXCHANGE  RISK  MANAGEMENT  (CONTINUED)

     THE  COMPANY  IS  EXPOSED  TO  CREDIT-RELATED  LOSSES  IN  THE  EVENT  OF
NON-PERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  THE CREDIT EXPOSURE
OF  FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTIONS AT JUNE 30, 2003 WAS $2.6 MILLION, WHICH REPRESENTS
THE  POSITIVE  FAIR  VALUE  OF  OPTIONS  HELD  BY  THE  COMPANY.

     THE  COMPANY  HELD  FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS
TOTALING  $124.5  MILLION  AND  $160.5  MILLION  AT  JUNE  30,  2003  AND  2002,
RESPECTIVELY TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ITEMS.  THESE CONTRACTS MATURE AT VARIOUS
DATES  PRIOR  TO  JULY  2005.

     (N)     INCOME  TAXES

          THE  COMPANY  ACCOUNTS  FOR INCOME TAXES UNDER THE ASSET AND LIABILITY
METHOD.  DEFERRED  TAX  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE FUTURE TAX
CONSEQUENCES  ATTRIBUTABLE  TO  DIFFERENCES  BETWEEN  THE  FINANCIAL  STATEMENT
CARRYING  AMOUNTS  OF  EXISTING  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX
BASES.  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED TAX RATES
EXPECTED  TO  APPLY  TO  TAXABLE  INCOME  IN  THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY
DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED.  THE EFFECT ON DEFERRED TAX
ASSETS  AND  LIABILITIES OF A CHANGE IN TAX RATES IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN THE
PERIOD  THAT  INCLUDES  THE  ENACTMENT  DATE.

     (O)     MARKETABLE  SECURITIES

          MANAGEMENT  DETERMINES  THE  APPROPRIATE  CLASSIFICATION  OF  ITS
INVESTMENTS  IN  DEBT  AND  EQUITY  SECURITIES  AT  THE  TIME  OF  PURCHASE  AND
RE-EVALUATES SUCH DETERMINATION AT EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE.  DEBT SECURITIES FOR
WHICH  THE  COMPANY  DOES NOT HAVE THE INTENT OR ABILITY TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE
CLASSIFIED  AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE.  SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT
FAIR  VALUE,  WITH  THE  UNREALIZED  GAINS  AND  LOSSES, NET OF TAX, REPORTED IN
ACCUMULATED  OTHER  COMPREHENSIVE  INCOME (LOSS).  REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE
INCLUDED  IN  OTHER  INCOME  OR  EXPENSE.

          AT  JUNE  30,  2003  AND  2002,  THE  COMPANY'S  INVESTMENTS  IN  DEBT
SECURITIES  WERE  CLASSIFIED  ON  THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS
MARKETABLE  SECURITIES  AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE.  THESE  INVESTMENTS  ARE DIVERSIFIED
AMONG HIGH CREDIT QUALITY SECURITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT
POLICY.

          AT  JUNE  30,  2003,  CONTRACTUAL  MATURITIES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES
AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE  WERE  ALL  LESS  THAN  ONE  YEAR.

     (P)     WARRANTY

          ESTIMATED  FUTURE WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO CERTAIN PRODUCTS ARE
PROVIDED  BY CHARGES TO OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE RELATED REVENUE IS
RECOGNIZED.

     (Q)     IMPAIRMENT  OF  LONG-LIVED  ASSETS

          THE  COMPANY  PERIODICALLY  EVALUATES THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED
ASSETS  TO  BE  HELD AND USED, INCLUDING CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS,
WHEN  EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY
NOT BE RECOVERED.  RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED IS MEASURED BY A
COMPARISON  OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET TO FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS EXPECTED
TO BE GENERATED BY THE ASSET.  IF SUCH ASSETS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE
IMPAIRMENT  TO  BE  RECOGNIZED  IS  MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING
AMOUNT OF THE ASSETS EXCEED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS.  ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED
OF ARE REPORTED AT THE LOWER OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OR FAIR VALUE, LESS COSTS TO
SELL.

     (R)     CAPITALIZED  SOFTWARE  PRODUCTION  COSTS

     SOFTWARE  DEVELOPMENT COSTS HAVE BEEN CAPITALIZED AND  WILL BE AMORTIZED TO
THE  COST OF PRODUCT REVENUES OVER THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIVES (GENERALLY THREE
TO  FIVE  YEARS)  OF  THE  PRODUCTS  THAT  INCLUDE  SUCH  SOFTWARE.  TOTAL  NET
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE PRODUCTION COSTS WERE $1,557,000 AND $1,132,000 AT JUNE 30,
2003  AND  2002  RESPECTIVELY.

(S)     STOCK-BASED  EMPLOYEE  COMPENSATION

THE  COMPANY  APPLIES  APB OPINION NO. 25 IN ACCOUNTING FOR ITS PLANS AND AS ALL
STOCK  OPTIONS ARE ISSUED AT MARKET PRICE ON DATE OF ISSUE, NO COMPENSATION COST
HAS  BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR ITS STOCK OPTIONS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE
EFFECT  ON NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE IF THE COMPANY HAD APPLIED THE FAIR
VALUE  RECOGNITION  PROVISIONS OF FASB STATEMENT 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION,  TO  STOCK-BASED  EMPLOYEE  COMPENSATION.




THE  FAIR  VALUE  OF  EACH STOCK OPTION GRANT WAS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT
USING  THE  BLACK-SCHOLES  OPTION-PRICING  MODEL WITH THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS:
WEIGHTED  AVERAGE  RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES OF 2.8%, 4.8% AND 6.0% FOR THE YEARS
ENDED  JUNE  30,  2003,  2002 AND 2001 RESPECTIVELY; NO DIVIDEND YIELD; EXPECTED
OPTION LIVES OF 3.3 YEARS FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 AND 5.5 AND 4.8 YEARS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY, AND VOLATILITY OF 63%,
60%  AND  61%  FOR  THE  YEARS  ENDED JUNE 30, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 RESPECTIVELY.

(3)     NEW  ACCOUNTING  PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN  MAY 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") ISSUED STATEMENT
OF  FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD ("SFAS") 150, ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS  WITH  CHARACTERISTICS  OF  BOTH  LIABILITIES  AND EQUITY.  SFAS 150
REQUIRES  THAT CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WHICH UNDER PREVIOUS GUIDANCE WERE
ACCOUNTED  FOR  AS  EQUITY,  MUST  NOW  BE  ACCOUNTED  FOR  AS LIABILITIES.  THE
FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS  AFFECTED  INCLUDE  MANDATORY  REDEEMABLE  STOCK, CERTAIN
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT REQUIRE OR MAY REQUIRE THE ISSUER TO BUY BACK SOME OF
ITS SHARES IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH OR OTHER ASSETS AND CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS THAT CAN
BE  SETTLED  WITH  SHARES  OF  STOCK.  SFAS  150  IS EFFECTIVE FOR ALL FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS  ENTERED  INTO  OR  MODIFIED  AFTER  MAY  31, 2003, AND OTHERWISE IS
EFFECTIVE  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST INTERIM PERIOD BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15,
2003.  THE COMPANY INTENDS TO ADOPT SFAS 150 EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2003 AND DOES NOT
BELIEVE  THAT  THE  ADOPTION  WILL  HAVE  A  MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL  POSITION  OR  RESULTS  OF  OPERATION.

IN  APRIL  2003,  THE  FASB  ISSUED  SFAS  149,  AMENDMENT  OF  STATEMENT 133 ON
DERIVATIVE  INSTRUMENTS  AND  HEDGING  ACTIVITIES,  WHICH  AMENDS  AND CLARIFIES
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN
DERIVATIVE  INSTRUMENTS  EMBEDDED  IN OTHER CONTRACTS AND FOR HEDGING ACTIVITIES
UNDER  SFAS  133.  SFAS  149 IS EFFECTIVE FOR CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO OR MODIFIED
AFTER  JUNE  30,  2003.  THE  COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS
STATEMENT.

IN  DECEMBER  2002,  THE  FASB  ISSUED  SFAS  148,  ACCOUNTING  FOR  STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION  - TRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE, WHICH AMENDS SFAS 123, ACCOUNTING FOR
STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION.  SFAS  148 AMENDS THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS IN SFAS
123  FOR  STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION FOR ANNUAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15,
2002 AND FOR INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2002.  SFAS 148 AMENDS
SFAS  123  TO  PROVIDE  ALTERNATIVE  METHODS  OF  TRANSITION  FOR AN ENTITY THAT
VOLUNTARILY  CHANGES  TO  FAIR  VALUE BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED
EMPLOYEE  COMPENSATION.  IT ALSO AMENDS THE DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123 TO
REQUIRE  PROMINENT  DISCLOSURE  ABOUT  THE  EFFECTS ON REPORTED NET INCOME OF AN
ENTITY'S  ACCOUNTING  POLICY  DECISIONS  WITH  RESPECT  TO  STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE
COMPENSATION.  FINALLY,  SFAS  148  AMENDS  ACCOUNTING  PRINCIPLES BOARD ("APB")
OPINION  NO.  28, INTERIM FINANCIAL REPORTING, TO REQUIRE DISCLOSURE ABOUT THOSE
EFFECTS  IN  INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED THE AMENDED
DISCLOSURE  PROVISIONS  OF  SFAS  148.

(3)     NEW  ACCOUNTING  PRONOUNCEMENTS,  CONTINUED

IN  JULY  2002,  THE  FASB  ISSUED SFAS 146, ACCOUNTING FOR RESTRUCTURING COSTS.
SFAS  146  APPLIES  TO  COSTS  ASSOCIATED  WITH  AN  EXIT  ACTIVITY  (INCLUDING
RESTRUCTURING)  OR  WITH  A DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  THOSE ACTIVITIES CAN
INCLUDE  ELIMINATING  OR  REDUCING  PRODUCT  LINES,  TERMINATING  EMPLOYEES  AND
CONTRACTS,  AND  RELOCATING  PLANT  FACILITIES  OR PERSONNEL.  UNDER SFAS 146, A
COMPANY  WILL  RECORD A LIABILITY FOR A COST ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXIT OR DISPOSAL
ACTIVITY  WHEN  THAT  LIABILITY  IS  INCURRED AND CAN BE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE.

SFAS  146 REQUIRES A COMPANY TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT ITS EXIT AND DISPOSAL
ACTIVITIES,  THE  RELATED  COSTS, AND CHANGES IN THOSE COSTS IN THE NOTES TO THE
INTERIM AND ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT INCLUDE THE PERIOD IN WHICH AN EXIT
ACTIVITY  IS  INITIATED  AND  IN  ANY  SUBSEQUENT  PERIOD  UNTIL THE ACTIVITY IS
COMPLETED.

SFAS  146  IS  EFFECTIVE PROSPECTIVELY FOR EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES INITIATED
AFTER  DECEMBER  31,  2002.  UNDER  SFAS  146,  A  COMPANY  MAY  NOT RESTATE ITS
PREVIOUSLY  ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SFAS 146 GRANDFATHERS THE ACCOUNTING
FOR  LIABILITIES  THAT  A  COMPANY HAD PREVIOUSLY RECORDED UNDER EMERGING ISSUES
TASK  FORCE ISSUE 94-3.  THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 146 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT
ON  THE  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY.

THE  FASB  ISSUED  SFAS  145,  RESCISSION  OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 4, 44, AND 64,
AMENDMENT  OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 13, AND TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS AS OF APRIL 2002.
SFAS  145  RESCINDS SFAS 4 AND SFAS 64, WHICH REQUIRED THAT ALL GAINS AND LOSSES
FROM  EXTINGUISHMENT  OF  DEBT  BE AGGREGATED, AND IF MATERIAL, CLASSIFIED AS AN
EXTRAORDINARY  ITEM.  AS A RESULT, GAINS AND LOSSES FROM DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT ARE
TO  BE  CLASSIFIED  AS EXTRAORDINARY ONLY IF THEY MEET THE CRITERIA SET FORTH IN
APB  OPINION NO. 30, REPORTING THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - REPORTING THE EFFECTS
OF  DISPOSAL  OF  A  SEGMENT  OF  A  BUSINESS,  AND  EXTRAORDINARY,  UNUSUAL AND
INFREQUENTLY  OCCURRING  EVENTS  AND  TRANSACTIONS.  SFAS 145 ALSO REQUIRES THAT
SALE-LEASEBACK  ACCOUNTING BE USED FOR CAPITAL LEASE MODIFICATIONS WITH ECONOMIC
EFFECTS  SIMILAR  TO  SALE-LEASEBACK  TRANSACTIONS.  THE  COMPANY HAS CLASSIFIED
GAINS  FROM  THE  EXTINGUISHMENT  OF  DEBT  AS  OTHER INCOME IN ITS CONSOLIDATED
STATEMENTS  OF  INCOME.

IN  AUGUST  2001,  THE  FASB  ISSUED SFAS 144, "ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR
DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS."  FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED, SFAS
144  RETAINS  THE  REQUIREMENTS  OF SFAS 121 TO (A) RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS
ONLY  IF  THE  CARRYING AMOUNT OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS NOT RECOVERABLE FROM ITS
UNDISCOUNTED  CASH  FLOWS  AND  (B) MEASURE AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS AS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN  THE  CARRYING  AMOUNT AND FAIR VALUE.  FURTHER, SFAS 144 ELIMINATES THE
REQUIREMENT  TO  ALLOCATE  GOODWILL  TO  LONG-LIVED  ASSETS  TO  BE  TESTED  FOR
IMPAIRMENT,  DESCRIBES  A  PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED CASH FLOW ESTIMATION APPROACH TO
DEAL  WITH  SITUATIONS  IN  WHICH  ALTERNATIVE  COURSES OF ACTION TO RECOVER THE
CARRYING  AMOUNT  OF  A  LONG-LIVED  ASSET ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION OR A RANGE IS
ESTIMATED  FOR  THE  AMOUNT  OF  POSSIBLE  FUTURE  CASH FLOWS, AND ESTABLISHES A
"PRIMARY-ASSET"  APPROACH  TO  DETERMINE  THE  CASH FLOW ESTIMATION PERIOD.  FOR
LONG-LIVED  ASSETS  TO BE DISPOSED OF OTHER THAN BY SALE (E.G. ASSETS ABANDONED,
EXCHANGED  OR  DISTRIBUTED TO OWNERS IN A SPIN-OFF), SFAS 144 REQUIRES THAT SUCH
ASSETS  BE  CONSIDERED  HELD  AND  USED  UNTIL  DISPOSED.

     FURTHER,  AN  IMPAIRMENT  LOSS SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AT THE DATE AN ASSET IS
EXCHANGED  FOR A SIMILAR PRODUCTIVE ASSET OR DISTRIBUTED TO OWNERS IN A SPIN-OFF
IF  THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS 144 ON
JULY  1,  2002.  ADOPTION  OF THE STANDARD DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE
RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS,  FINANCIAL  POSITION  OR  LIQUIDITY  OF  THE  COMPANY.

(3)     NEW  ACCOUNTING  PRONOUNCEMENTS,  CONTINUED

IN  JULY  2001,  THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.
AS  ALLOWED  UNDER THE STANDARD, THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED SFAS 142 EFFECTIVE JULY
1,  2001.  SFAS  142  REQUIRES  GOODWILL  AND  INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE
USEFUL  LIVES TO NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED, BUT INSTEAD BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT
LEAST  ANNUALLY.

WITH  THE  ADOPTION  OF  SFAS  142,  THE COMPANY REASSESSED THE USEFUL LIVES AND
RESIDUAL  VALUES  OF  ALL  ACQUIRED  INTANGIBLE  ASSETS  TO  MAKE  ANY NECESSARY
AMORTIZATION  PERIOD  ADJUSTMENTS.  BASED  ON THAT ASSESSMENT, ONLY GOODWILL WAS
DETERMINED TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE AND NO ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE TO THE
AMORTIZATION  PERIOD  OR  RESIDUAL  VALUES  OF  OTHER  INTANGIBLE  ASSETS.  IN
ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 142 THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL
IMPAIRMENT  IN  JULY 2002.  THE RESULTS OF THE REVIEW INDICATED THAT NO IMPAIRED
GOODWILL  CURRENTLY  EXISTS.

IN  JUNE  2001,  THE  FASB  ISSUED  SFAS  143,  "ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT
OBLIGATIONS,"  WHICH  REQUIRES  THAT  THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET
RETIREMENT  OBLIGATION  BE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT IS INCURRED IF A
REASONABLE  ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE CAN BE MADE.  THE ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT
COSTS  WOULD  BE  CAPITALIZED  AS  PART OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LONG-LIVED
ASSET  AND DEPRECIATED OVER THE LIFE OF THE ASSET.  THE LIABILITY IS ACCRETED AT
THE  END OF EACH PERIOD THROUGH CHARGES TO OPERATING EXPENSE.  IF THE OBLIGATION
IS SETTLED FOR OTHER THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY, THE COMPANY WILL
RECOGNIZE  A  GAIN  OR  LOSS  ON  SETTLEMENT.  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  SFAS 143 ARE
EFFECTIVE  FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15, 2002.  THE INITIAL ADOPTION
OF  SFAS  143  DID  NOT  HAVE  A  MATERIAL  IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,
FINANCIAL  POSITION  OR  LIQUIDITY  OF  THE  COMPANY.

(4)     MARKETABLE  SECURITIES

     THE  ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE AS OF
JUNE  30,  2003  AND  2002,  WAS  $6,533,000  AND  $19,979,000  RESPECTIVELY.

     EXPECTED  MATURITIES  MAY  DIFFER  FROM  CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES BECAUSE THE
ISSUERS  OF  THE  SECURITIES  MAY  HAVE  THE RIGHT TO PREPAY OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT
PREPAYMENT  PENALTIES.

FISCAL  YEAR  ENDED  JUNE  30,  2002  (CONTINUED)

PURCHASED  IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF $0.4 MILLION WAS EXPENSED UPON
ACQUISITION  OF  SMI  BECAUSE  TECHNOLOGICAL  FEASIBILITY  OF THE PRODUCTS UNDER
DEVELOPMENT  HAD  NOT  BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO FURTHER ALTERNATIVE USES EXISTED.
THE  VALUE  OF  IN-PROCESS  TECHNOLOGY  WAS  CALCULATED  BY IDENTIFYING RESEARCH
PROJECTS  IN AREAS FOR WHICH TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED,
ESTIMATING  THE  COSTS  TO  DEVELOP  THE  PURCHASED  IN-PROCESS  TECHNOLOGY INTO
COMMERCIALLY  VIABLE PRODUCTS, ESTIMATING THE RESULTING NET CASH FLOWS FROM SUCH
PRODUCTS,  DISCOUNTING  THE  NET  CASH  FLOWS TO PRESENT VALUE, AND APPLYING THE

THE  COMPANY  BELIEVES  THAT  THE  ASSUMPTIONS USED TO VALUE ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE
ASSETS  NOTED  ABOVE  WERE REASONABLE AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION AND AS AT MARCH
31,  2003.  NO  ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN, HOWEVER, THAT THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
USED  TO ESTIMATE EXPECTED PROJECT REVENUES, DEVELOPMENT COSTS OR PROFITABILITY,
OR EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH PROJECTS, WILL TRANSPIRE AS ESTIMATED.  FOR THESE
REASONS,  AMONG  OTHERS,  ACTUAL  RESULTS  MAY  VARY FROM THE PROJECTED RESULTS.

(18)     LEGAL  ACTIONS

THE COMPANY WAS ENGAGED IN LITIGATION RELATING TO THE ENFORCEMENT AND DEFENSE OF
CERTAIN  OF  ITS  PATENTS  DURING  THE  FISCAL  YEAR.

1995  LITIGATION  WITH  RESPIRONICS.  IN  JANUARY  1995,  OUR SUBSIDIARY, RESMED
LIMITED,  FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN
DISTRICT  OF  CALIFORNIA  SEEKING  MONETARY  DAMAGES  FROM AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
AGAINST  RESPIRONICS, INC. FOR ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT OF THREE OF ITS PATENTS.  IN

WESTERN  DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA, IN PITTSBURGH, AGAINST RESMED LIMITED SEEKING
A  DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT RESPIRONICS, INC. DOES NOT INFRINGE CLAIMS OF THESE
PATENTS  AND  THAT  RESMED LIMITED'S PATENTS ARE INVALID AND UNENFORCEABLE.  THE
RESPIRONICS  COMPLAINT  ALSO  MADE  THE  UNIVERSITY  OF  SYDNEY  A  PARTY AS THE
UNIVERSITY  OF  SYDNEY  IS  THE  ASSIGNEE  OF ONE OF THE PATENTS IN SUIT; RESMED
LIMITED IS THE EXCLUSIVE LICENSEE OF THAT PATENT.  THE TWO ACTIONS WERE COMBINED
AND  ARE  PROCEEDING  IN  THE  WESTERN  DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA.  IN JUNE 1996,
RESMED  LIMITED  FILED  AN  ADDITIONAL  COMPLAINT  AGAINST  RESPIRONICS  FOR
INFRINGEMENT OF A FOURTH RESMED PATENT, AND THAT COMPLAINT WAS CONSOLIDATED WITH
THE  EARLIER  ACTION.

THE  COURT  HAS  GRANTED  THREE  PARTIAL  SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTIONS, FINDING THAT

JUDGMENT  MOTION,  THE  PARTIES  JOINTLY STIPULATED TO A DISMISSAL OF CHARGES OF
INFRINGEMENT  UNDER THE FOURTH RESMED PATENT, WITH RESMED RESERVING THE RIGHT TO
REASSERT  THE  CHARGES IN THE EVENT OF A FAVORABLE RULING ON APPEAL OF THE THIRD

COMPLAINT  FURTHER CHARGED THE DEFENDANTS WITH THE COPYING OF RESMED PROPRIETARY
MASK  TECHNOLOGY  AND  ALLEGES VIOLATIONS OF THE LANHAM ACT, TRADEMARK AND TRADE
DRESS  INFRINGEMENT  AND  COMMON  LAW  VIOLATIONS  RELATING TO THE APPEARANCE OF

ADDITION,  FISHER  &  PAYKEL MAY CONTINUE TO SELL ITS EXISTING MASKS OUTSIDE THE
UNITED  STATES  UNTIL  OCTOBER  1,  2003,  UNDER  LICENSE  FROM RESMED, UNTIL IT
INTRODUCES  THE  NEW  VERSION  THERE.  RESMED  HAS  DISMISSED  THE  LAWSUIT WITH
PREJUDICE.

AND  RESMED  LIMITED  FILED  A  LAWSUIT  IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN

OTHER  LITIGATION.  IN  ADDITION  TO  THE MATTERS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IN THE NORMAL
COURSE  OF  BUSINESS,  WE  ARE  SUBJECT  TO ROUTINE LITIGATION INCIDENTAL TO OUR

EFFECT  ON  OUR  CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  TAKEN  AS  A  WHOLE.


(19)     IN-PROCESS  RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT  CHARGE

MAP

ON  ACQUISITION  OF MAP IN FEBRUARY 2001, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AS AN EXPENSE A
CHARGE OF $17.7 MILLION WITH RESPECT TO FIVE IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
PROGRAMS  UNDER  ACTIVE  DEVELOPMENT  BY  MAP  AT DATE OF ACQUISITION.  THE FIVE
PROJECTS  WERE:

(I)     A  SINGLE-WALLED  NASAL  CUSHION  MASK  SYSTEM.
(II)    A  NEW  HEADGEAR  SYSTEM
(III)   STANDALONE  ACTIVE  HUMIDIFIER
(IV)    AN  AUTOTITRATION  CPAP  DEVICE  FOR  TREATMENT  OF  OSA
(V)     A  NEW  OSA  DIAGNOSTIC  DEVICE.

THE  STATUS  OF  EACH  PROJECT  IS  AS  NOTED  BELOW:

(I)     SINGLE-WALLED  NASAL  CUSHION

THE NASAL CUSHION UNDER DEVELOPMENT BY MAP ON ACQUISITION WAS ORIGINALLY DUE FOR
RELEASE IN OCTOBER 2001.  DELAYS IN THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS DELAYED
THE  RELEASE  FOR  SEVEN  MONTHS, UNTIL APRIL 2002.  THE DELAY IN RELEASE OF THE
PRODUCT  WAS  NOT  SIGNIFICANT  OVER  ITS  EXPECTED  LIFE CYCLE, AND HAS MADE NO
SIGNIFICANT  IMPACT ON THE NET RETURN ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE INITIAL IN-PROCESS
RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT MODEL.  SINCE RELEASE, THE PRODUCT (NOW REFERRED TO AS
THE  PAPILLON)  HAS  MET  OR  EXCEEDED  ALL  SALES  FORECASTS.

(II)     NEW  HEADGEAR

THE  NEW  HEADGEAR PRODUCT LINE WAS WITHHELD TO COINCIDE WITH THE RELEASE OF THE
PAPILLION MASK SYSTEM IN APRIL 2002 AND SO WAS ALSO SEVEN MONTHS BEHIND SCHEDULE
IN PROJECTED RELEASE DATES.  SINCE RELEASE, THE NEW HEADGEAR SYSTEM HAS EXCEEDED
ORIGINAL SALES PROJECTIONS AND CONTINUES TO MEET OR EXCEED INITIAL EXPECTATIONS.

(19)     IN-PROCESS  RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT  CHARGE,  CONTINUED

(III)     STANDALONE  ACTIVE  HUMIDIFIER

DUE  TO  OTHER  PRIORITIES  AND TO THE INTRODUCTION OF INTEGRATED HUMIDIFICATION
FLOW  GENERATOR  DEVICES  BY A NUMBER OF COMPETITORS DURING FISCAL 2002, WE HAVE
DELAYED  THE  STANDALONE  HUMIDIFIER  PROJECT.

GIVEN  THE  RELATIVELY  SMALL  REVENUE  FORECAST  OF  THE  PRODUCT  LINE  IN THE
IN-PROCESS  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MODEL, THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THIS PROJECT
IS  NOT  MATERIAL  TO  RESMED  OR  THE  NET  RETURN  OF  THE  MAP  ACQUISITION.

(IV)     AUTO  TITRATION  CPAP  DEVICE

THE  MAIN  PRODUCT  DEVELOPMENT  EFFORT OF MAP SINCE ACQUISITION HAS BEEN ON THE
COMPLETION  OF  THE  AUTOTITRATION  CPAP FLOW GENERATOR SPECIFIED IN THE INITIAL
IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CHARGE. THIS PROJECT EXPERIENCED SOME DELAYS
DUE  TO  THE  COMPLEXITY  OF  THE  SOFTWARE  ALGORITHM  DEVELOPMENT  PROCESS AND
ASSOCIATED ELECTRONICS RESULTING IN THE PRODUCT BEING RELEASED IN NOVEMBER 2002.

(V)     OSA  DIAGNOSTIC  DEVICE

MAP'S  NEW  DIAGNOSTIC  DEVICE  REMAINS  ON TARGET FOR INITIAL MARKET RELEASE IN
CALENDAR  2003  ALTHOUGH  THE  FORECASTED  RELEASE  DATE  OF  MARCH 2003 WAS NOT
ACHIEVED.  WE  REMAIN  CONFIDENT  IN  THE  CAPACITY OF THE DEVICE TO ENHANCE THE
DIAGNOSTIC  PROCESS,  AND  REMAIN  CONFIDENT  IN THE POTENTIAL OF THE PRODUCT TO
SIGNIFICANTLY  IMPACT  THE TREATMENT AND DIAGNOSIS OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA IN
THE  GERMAN  MARKET.

AS  AT  JUNE  30,  2003, THREE OF THE FIVE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED WITH THE
RELEASE  OF  THE  PAPILLON  MASK  SYSTEM,  UPGRADED  HEADGEAR  AND  THE MAGELLAN
AUTOMATED  FLOW  GENERATOR CPAP DEVICE.  ALL THREE PRODUCTS ARE GENERATING SALES
REVENUE  CONSISTENT  WITH  OUR  ORIGINAL  EXPECTATIONS  AND  ASSUMPTIONS USED IN
CALCULATING  THE  IN-PROCESS  RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT  CHARGE.  WE  EXPECT TO
RELEASE  PRODUCTS  WITH  RESPECT  TO  BOTH  REMAINING  IN-PROCESS  RESEARCH  AND
DEVELOPMENT  PROGRAMS  OVER  THE  NEXT  TWELVE-MONTH  PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY
CONSISTENT  WITH  OUR  ORIGINAL  EXPECTATIONS.

GIVEN  THE  SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE ABOVE RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND PERFORMANCE
OF  THE ASSOCIATED PRODUCT LINES, WE REMAIN CONFIDENT IN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO
DETERMINE THE IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CHARGE AND AS A RESULT THE NET
RETURN  OF  THE  MAP  ACQUISITION.
