General

We are a leading developer, manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating, diagnosing, and managing sleep-disordered breathing, or SDB.
SDB includes obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA, and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep. When we were formed in 1989, our primary purpose was to commercialize a treatment for OSA developed by Professor Colin Sullivan. This treatment,
nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, or CPAP, was the first successful noninvasive treatment for OSA. CPAP systems deliver pressurized air, typically through a nasal mask, to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep.

Since the development of CPAP, we have developed a number of innovative
products for SDB, including airflow generators, diagnostic products, mask systems, headgear and other accessories. Our growth has been fuelled by geographic expansion, increased awareness of SDB as a significant health concern among physicians and
patients, and our research and product development effort.

We
employ 1,520 people and sell our products in over 60 countries through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors.

Our web site address is www.resmed.com. We make our periodic reports, together with any amendments, available on our web site, free of charge, as soon as
reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish the reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Corporate History

ResMed Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in March 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our domestic, Australian and European operating
subsidiaries. On June 1, 1995, we completed an initial public offering of common stock and on June 2, 1995 our common stock commenced trading on the NASDAQ National Market. On September 30, 1999 we transferred our principal public listing to the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE), trading under the ticker symbol RMD. On November 25, 1999, we established a secondary listing of our common stock via Chess Depositary Instruments, or CDI’s, on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), also under the
symbol RMD. Ten CDI’s on the ASX represent one share of our common stock on the NYSE. On July 1, 2002, we converted our ASX listing status from a foreign exempt listing to a full listing.

Our Australian subsidiary, ResMed Holdings Limited, was originally organized
in 1989 by Dr. Peter Farrell to acquire from Baxter Center for Medical Research Pty Limited, or Baxter, the rights to certain technology relating to CPAP treatment as well as Baxter’s existing CPAP device business. Baxter had sold CPAP devices
in Australia since 1988, having acquired the rights to the technology in 1987.

Since formation we have acquired a number of operating businesses including Servo Magnetics Inc, Labhardt AG, MAP Medizin Technologie GmbH, Dieter W. Priess Medtechnik, Premium Medical SARL, Innovmedics Pte Ltd and
EINAR Egnell AB on May 14, 2002; November 15, 2001; February 16, 2001; February 7, 1996; June 12, 1996; November 1, 1997; and January 31, 2000 respectively. During the 1999 fiscal year we made an equity investment in Medcare Flaga hf (Medcare),
based in Iceland. We now market Medcare’s polysomnographic products under the Embla and Embletta label in selected countries.

The Market

Sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states: rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep and non-rapid
eye movement, or non-REM, sleep. REM sleep, which is about 20-25% of total sleep experienced by adults, is characterized by a high level of brain activity, bursts of rapid eye movement, increased heart and respiration rates, and paralysis of many
muscles. Non-REM sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth; stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest.

The upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles. Normally, during REM sleep and deeper levels of
non-REM sleep, upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows. Individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep, or apneas, or near closures of the upper airways, or
hypopneas. These breathing irregularities result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration, causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond. Typically, the individual
subconsciously arouses from sleep, causing the throat muscles to contract, opening the airway. After a few gasping breaths, blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself. Sufferers of OSA
typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour. While these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep, the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions. In addition, OSA has recently been recognized as a cause of hypertension
and a significant co-morbidity for heart disease, stroke and diabetes.

Scientists estimate that one in five adults have some form of obstructive sleep apnea. In the U.S. alone, this represents approximately 43 million people. Despite the high prevalence of OSA, there is a general lack of awareness of OSA among
both the medical community and the general public. It is estimated that less than 10% of those with OSA have been diagnosed or treated. Many health care professionals are often unable to diagnose OSA because they are unaware that such non-specific
symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, hypertension and irritability are characteristic of OSA.

While OSA has been diagnosed in a broad cross-section of the population, it is predominant among middle-aged men and those who are obese, smoke, consume
alcohol in excess or use muscle-relaxing and pain-killing drugs. Recently a strong association has been discovered between OSA and a number of cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies have shown that SDB is present in approximately 80% of patients
with drug-resistant hypertension, approximately 60% of stroke patients and approximately 50% of patients with congestive heart failure. In addition, patients who are being treated for certain other conditions, including those undergoing dialysis
treatment or suffering from diabetes, may have an increased incidence of OSA.

Sleep-Disordered Breathing and Obstructive Sleep Apnea

Sleep-disordered breathing encompasses all physiological processes that cause detrimental breathing patterns during sleep. Manifestations include OSA, central sleep apnea, or CSA, and hypoventilation syndromes that
occur during sleep. Hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity, chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease. OSA is the most common form of SDB.

Sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by OSA can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness,
reduced cognitive function, including memory loss and lack of concentration, depression and irritability. OSA sufferers also may experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas. Several studies
indicate that the oxygen desaturation, increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by OSA may be associated with

- 4 -


increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina, stroke and heart attack. Patients with OSA have been shown to have impaired daytime
performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving, response speed and visual motor coordination, and studies have linked OSA to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents.

Generally, an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of OSA is
referred by a general practitioner to a specialist for further evaluation. The diagnosis of OSA typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home. During overnight testing, respiratory
parameters and sleep patterns are monitored along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels. These tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas, hypopneas or subconscious awakenings. We
estimate that there are currently around 5,000 sleep clinics in the United States, a substantial portion of which are affiliated with hospitals. The number of sleep clinics has expanded significantly from approximately 100 such facilities in 1985.

Existing Therapies

Prior to 1981, the primary treatment for OSA was a tracheotomy, a surgical
procedure to cut a hole in the patient’s windpipe to create a channel for airflow. Most recently, surgery has involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, or UPPP, in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to
streamline the shape of the airway, or mandibular advancement, in which the lower jaw is moved forward to widen the patient’s airway. UPPP alone has a poor success rate; however, when performed in conjunction with multi-stage upper airway
surgical procedures, a greater success rate has been claimed. These combined procedures, performed by highly specialized surgeons, are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods.

CPAP, by contrast, is a non-invasive means of treating OSA. CPAP was first
used as a treatment for OSA in 1980 by Dr. Colin Sullivan, the past Chairman of our Medical Advisory Board. CPAP systems were commercialized for treatment of OSA in the United States in the mid 1980’s. Today, use of CPAP is generally
acknowledged as the most effective and least invasive therapy for managing OSA.

During CPAP treatment, a patient sleeps with a nasal mask connected to a small portable airflow generator that delivers room air at a positive pressure. The patient breathes in air from the flow generator and breathes
out through an exhaust port in the mask. Continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed. Sometimes when a patient leaks air through their mouth, a full-face mask may need to
be used.

CPAP is not a cure and therefore, must be used on a
daily basis as long as treatment is required. Patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of CPAP treatment. Early generations of CPAP units provided limited patient comfort and convenience. Patients experienced soreness from the
repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the CPAP device operating at the prescribed pressure. In more recent years, product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed. These include more
comfortable mask systems; delay timers which gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily; bilevel air flow generators, including VPAP systems, which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation;
heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable; and auto titration devices which reduce the average pressure delivered during the night.

Business Strategy

We believe that the SDB market will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors including increasing awareness of OSA, improved
understanding of the role of SDB treatment in the

- 5 -


management of cardiac, neurologic, metabolic and related disorders, and an increase in home-based diagnosis. Our strategy for expanding our business
operations and capitalizing on the growth of the SDB market consists of the following key elements.

Continue Product Development and Innovation.

We are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis
and treatment of SDB. We have been a leading innovator of products designed to more effectively treat SDB, increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy. For example, in 1999 we introduced the Mirage Full Face Mask. This
mask contains an inflatable air pocket, which conforms to the patient’s facial contours, creating a more comfortable and better seal. Additionally, in 2002 we introduced the AutoSet Spirit flow generator, our second-generation autotitrating
device that adapts to the patient’s breathing patterns to more effectively treat OSA. We believe that continued product development and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success. Approximately 15% of our employees are devoted to
research and development activities. In fiscal year 2004, we invested $26.2 million, or 8% of our revenues, in research and development.

Expand Geographic Presence.

We market our products in over 60 countries to sleep clinics, home health care dealers and third
party payers. We intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal markets, as well as expand the depth of our presence in other geographic regions.

Increase Public and Clinical Awareness.

We intend to continue to expand our existing
promotional activities to increase awareness of SDB and our treatment alternatives. These promotional activities target the population with predisposition to SDB as well as primary care physicians and specialists, such as cardiologists, neurologists
and pulmonologists. In addition, we also target special interest groups, including the National Stroke Association, the American Heart Association and the National Sleep Foundation.

During fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, we donated $0.5 million, $nil and $2.3
million respectively to the ResMed Sleep Disordered Breathing Foundations in the United States and Australia to further enhance research and awareness of SDB. The contributions to the Foundations reflect ResMed’s commitment to medical research
into sleep-disordered breathing, particularly the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.

Expand into New Clinical Applications.

We continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs. Recent studies have established a clinical
association between OSA and both stroke and congestive heart failure, and have recognized SDB as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure. We have developed a device, which has not been approved for sale in the United States, for the treatment
of Cheyne-Stokes breathing in patients with congestive heart failure. Currently, over 1,000 patients are being treated by this device in Europe. In addition, we maintain close working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore
new medical applications for our products and technology.

Leverage the Experience of our Management Team and Medical Advisory Board.

Our senior management team has extensive experience in the medical device industry in general, and in the field of SDB in particular.
Our Medical Advisory Board is comprised of experts in the field of SDB. We intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and increase awareness of
the serious medical problems caused by SDB.

Products

Our portfolio of
products for the treatment of OSA and other forms of SDB includes airflow generators, diagnostic products, mask systems, headgear and other accessories.

Air Flow Generators

We produce CPAP, VPAP and AutoSet systems for the diagnosis, titration and treatment of SDB. The flow generator systems
deliver positive airway pressure through a small nasal mask (or sometimes a full-face mask).

Our VPAP units deliver ultra-quiet, comfortable bilevel therapy. There are two preset pressures: a higher pressure as the patient breathes in, and a lower pressure as the patient breathes out. Breathing out against a
lower pressure makes treatment more comfortable, particularly for patients who need high pressure levels or for those with impaired breathing ability.

AutoSet systems are based on a proprietary technology to monitor breathing and can also be used in the diagnosis, treatment and management of OSA. CPAP
and VPAP flow generators, accounted for approximately 50%, 53% and 55% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Mask Systems and Diagnostic Products

Mask systems are one of the most important elements of SDB treatment
systems. Masks are a primary determinant of patient comfort and as such may drive or impede patient compliance with therapy. We have been a consistent innovator in masks, improving patient comfort while minimizing size and weight. Masks,
accessories, motors and diagnostic products accounted for approximately 50%, 47% and 45% of our net revenues in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Accessories and Other Products

To enhance patient comfort, convenience and compliance, we market a variety of other products and accessories. These
products include humidifiers, such as the HumidAire and H2i, which connect directly with the CPAP, VPAP and AutoSet flow generators to humidify and heat the air delivered to the patient. Their use prevents the drying of nasal passages that can cause
discomfort. Other optional accessories include cold passover humidifiers, carry bags and breathing circuits. MAP also offers a range of accessories, including the Twister remote, an intelligent remote control for use in the sleep laboratory
environment to set and monitor flow generators, the Aero-Click connection system, which allows a quick, simple connect/disconnect between the mask and CPAP air delivery source and the AeroFix headgear, for the comfortable adjustment of masks for
CPAP therapy. Since the May 2002 acquisition of Servo Magnetics Inc., we have sold custom electric motors, primarily for use in data storage and aerospace applications.

Product Development and Clinical Trials

We have a strong track record in innovation in the sleep market. In 1989, we introduced our first CPAP device. Since then we
have been committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development. Currently, our product development efforts are focused on not only improving our current product offerings, but also expanding into new product applications. For
example, in 1997, we introduced the Mirage Mask. This mask was based on the innovative Bubble Mask technology introduced in 1991, which used the principle of air inflation of the mask cushion to create a more comfortable and better seal by better
conforming to patient facial contours.

- 10 -


In 1999, we introduced the AutoSet T flow generator, an autotitrating device that adapts to the
patient’s breathing patterns to effectively prevent apneas. In 2001, we introduced our next generation autotitrating device, the AutoSet Spirit. The AutoSet Spirit is an autotitrating modular device with optional integrated humidifier. In
September 2003 we introduced the ACTiva nasal mask using our patented Active Cushion Technology, which automatically seals mask leaks. Recently, we also launched an improved AutoSet CS 2 (outside the U.S. only) to treat congestive heart failure
patients with significant central sleep apnea.

We continually
seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs. SDB is associated with a number of symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness and irritability. Recent studies have established a clinical association between
SDB and hypertension, stroke, and congestive heart failure. We support clinical trials in the United States, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology.

We consult with physicians at major sleep centers throughout the world to
identify technological trends in the treatment of SDB. Some of these physicians currently serve on our Medical Advisory Board. New product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff, direct sales force, network of distributors,
manufacturers’ representatives, customers, and patients. Typically, our internal development staff then perform new product development.

In fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, we invested $26.2 million, $20.5 million and $14.9 million, respectively, on research and development.

Sales and Marketing

We currently market our products in over 60 countries using a network of
distributors, independent manufacturers’ representatives and our direct sales force. We attempt to tailor our marketing approach to each national market, based on regional awareness of SDB as a health problem, physician referral patterns,
consumer preferences and local reimbursement policies.

North America and Latin America.

Our products are typically purchased by a home health care dealer who then sells the products to the patient. The decision to purchase our products, as opposed those of our
competitors, is made or influenced by one or more of the following individuals or organizations: the prescribing physician and his or her staff, the home health care dealer, the insurer and the patient. In the United States, our sales and marketing
activities are conducted through a field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives, program development specialists, regional sales directors, and independent manufacturers’ representatives. Our United States field sales
organization markets and sells products to more than 4,000 home health care dealer branch locations throughout the United States. Our direct sales force receives a base salary, plus commissions, while our independent sales representatives receive
higher commissions, but no base salary.

We also promote and
market our products directly to sleep clinics. Patients who are diagnosed with OSA and prescribed CPAP treatment are typically referred by the diagnosing sleep clinic to a home health care dealer to fill the prescription. The home health care
dealer, in consultation with the referring physician, will assist the patient in selecting the equipment, fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the flow generator pressure to the prescribed level. In the United States, our sales
employees and manufacturers’ representatives are managed by two regional Sales Directors, our Senior Vice President of Sales, Marketing and our Chief Operating Officer for the Americas.

Our Canadian and Latin American sales are conducted through independent
distributors. Sales in North and Latin America accounted for 49%, 48% and 49% of our net revenues for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

- 11 -


Europe.

We market our products in most major European countries. We have
wholly owned subsidiaries in Germany, France, United Kingdom, Spain, Switzerland, Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Finland and we use independent distributors to sell our products in other areas of Europe. Distributors are selected in each country
based on their knowledge of respiratory medicine and a commitment to SDB therapy. In each country in which we have a subsidiary, a local senior manager is responsible for direct national sales.

Our Vice President Sales & Marketing Europe and Asia Pacific is
responsible for coordination of all European activities and, in conjunction with local management, the direct sales activity in Europe. Sales in Europe accounted for 43%, 42% and 42% of our total net revenues for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Australia/Rest of
World.

Marketing in Australia and the rest of the world is the responsibility of our Vice President Sales & Marketing. Sales in Australia and the rest of the world accounted for 8%, 10% and 9% of our total net revenues
for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Other Marketing Efforts.

In addition to our, and our distributor’s sales efforts, we work with the following cardiovascular disease associations to raise awareness of the co-morbidity of SDB in
cardiovascular disease patients (cardiovascular disease includes coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension and stroke):

(i) American College of Cardiology.    We work with the American College of Cardiology and its more than 20,000 cardiologist members
to increase education and awareness in the cardiology community regarding the morbidity associated with sleep apnea in their patients. We have co-sponsored educational symposia with Guidant Corp at ACC in 2003 and ACC 2004 on sleep apnea and
cardiovascular disease. We have exhibited at ACC national conferences since 2001. Sleep apnea made it onto the formal ACC scientific sessions in 2004.

(ii) American Heart Association.    We have worked with the American Heart Association and we have attended the annual Scientific
Sessions since 2001. Sleep apnea has been on the official program of the Scientific Sessions since 2002. We work with various regional and local AHA affiliates to increase awareness regarding sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease.

(iii) Heart Failure Society of America.    We have
attended the Heart Failure Society of America national conferences since 2002. We have co-sponsored CME-level educational symposia with Guidant at HFSA 2003 and HFSA 2004 on sleep apnea and heart failure. We continue to see a very high level of
interest amongst heart failure physicians, due to the significant (approximately 50%) prevalence of sleep apnea in heart failure patients, and the outcome improvements in blood pressure and ejection fraction observed in peer-reviewed studies using
CPAP treatment.

Strategic Alliances

Guidant Corporation.

The Guidant Corporation
is a world leader in the treatment of cardiac and vascular disease. Guidant and ResMed have entered into an agreement pursuant to which the companies will work together in the areas of sleep-disordered breathing and cardiac rhythm disorders, disease

Medcare is a global leader providing sleep diagnostic solutions to
sleep service providers and other professionals practicing sleep medicine. Medcare offers a broad range of solutions including the Embla

™

/Somnologica and REMbrandt

™

sleep systems. Medcare products are distributed to over 50 countries worldwide. We distribute Medcare products in selected countries and we have a
co-marketing agreement with Medcare for the U.S. and German markets.

We believe that our affiliations and continued work with these organizations raises the awareness of SDB as a significant health concern.

Manufacturing

Our principal manufacturing facility is located in Sydney, Australia and comprise a 215,000 square feet manufacturing facility. Our manufacturing
operations consist primarily of assembly and testing of our flow generators, masks and accessories. Of the numerous raw materials, parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products, most are
off-the-shelf items available from multiple vendors. We generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received. Over the last few years the manufacturing processes have been transformed along lean manufacturing guidelines
to flow lines staffed by dedicated teams. Each team is responsible for manufacture and quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures including customer feedback.

Our quality management system is based upon the requirements of ISO 9001,
EN46001 (European Medical Standards), FDA Quality System Regulations for medical devices (21 CFR part 820) and the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC). Our Sydney, Australia facility is accredited to ISO 9001 and EN46001 and our San Diego,
California facility is accredited to ISO 9002 and EN46002. These two sites have third party audits conducted by the ISO certification bodies at regular intervals.

Our German manufacturing operation based in Munich operates in a facility of approximately 24,000 square feet. This facility
is accredited to ISO 9001 and EN46001 and primarily assembles and tests flow generators for sale by our subsidiary MAP GmbH. Appropriate quality controls monitor and measure product assembly and performance.

In addition to our Australian and German manufacturing operations we also
manufacture high quality electric motors for both our flow generator devices and external customers, primarily in the data storage and aerospace sectors, at our Servo Magnetics Inc. (SMI) facility at Canoga Park, California. The SMI facility is
approximately 35,500 square feet.

Third-Party Reimbursement

The cost of medical care in many of the countries in
which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs. Although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payers, our success in major markets is dependent upon the ability of
patients to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products.

In
the United States, our products are purchased primarily by home health care dealers, hospitals or sleep clinics, which then invoice third-party payers directly. Domestic third-party payers include Medicare, Medicaid, and corporate health insurance
plans. These payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, or is experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. The long-term trend towards managed health care, or
legislative proposals to reform health care, could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products and could result in lower prices for our products.

- 13 -


Even though we do not file claims or bill governmental programs and other third-party payers directly for
reimbursement for our products sold in the United States, we are still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental programs, and any violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties, including fines.
In particular, the federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing,
recommending or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a Federal health care program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales
activities of manufacturers and distributors like us. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Law. We are also subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any third-party payer. These laws
prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payers. These laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information
on coverage, coding and reimbursement of their products to persons who bill third-party payers. We continuously strive to comply with these laws and believe that our arrangements do not violate these laws. Liability may still arise from the
intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business or from a different governmental agency interpretation of the laws.

In some foreign markets, such as Spain, France and Germany, government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products,
however, subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations. In Australia and in some other foreign markets, there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat OSA.

Service and Warranty

We generally offer one-year or two-year limited warranties on our flow
generator products. Warranties on mask systems are for 90 days. In most markets, we rely on our distributors to repair our products with parts supplied by us. In the United States, home health care dealers generally arrange shipment of products to
our San Diego facility for repair.

We receive returns of our
products from the field for various reasons. We believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices. We provide for warranties and returns based on historical
data.

Competition

The markets for our products are highly competitive. We believe that the
principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features, reliability and price. Customer support, reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors.

We compete on a market-by-market basis with various companies, some of which have greater financial, research, manufacturing
and marketing resources than ourselves. In the United States, our principal market, Respironics, Inc., DeVilbiss, a division of Sunrise Medical Inc., and Nellcor Puritan Bennett, a subsidiary of Tyco Inc., are the primary competitors for our CPAP
products. Our principal European competitors are also Respironics, DeVilbiss, and Nellcor Puritan Bennett, as well as regional European manufacturers. The disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the
trend towards consolidation in the health care industry. In addition, our products compete with surgical procedures and dental appliances designed to treat OSA and other SDB related respiratory conditions. The development of new or innovative
procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete for market acceptance
and market share. An important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance
processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are expected to be important competitive factors. In addition, our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on the extent to which we are successful in protecting our
patents and other intellectual property.

Patents and
Proprietary Rights and Related Litigation

Through our
subsidiaries ResMed Limited, Medizintechnik fur Arzt und Patient GmbH and SMI, we own or have licensed rights to 142 issued United States patents (including 35 design patents) and 167 issued foreign patents. In addition, there are 169 pending United
States patent applications (including 35 design patent applications), 301 pending foreign patent applications, 255 registered foreign designs and 45 pending foreign designs. Some of these patents and patent applications relate to significant aspects
and features of our products. These include U.S. patents relating to our CPAP devices, a delay timer system, the Bubble Mask, and an automated means of varying air pressure based upon a patient’s changing needs during nightly use, such as that
employed in our AutoSet device.

Of our patents, seven United
States patents and two foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years, with one foreign patent due to expire in each of the years 2005 and 2007 and one United States patent in 2005, two United States patents in 2007 and four United States
patents in 2008. We believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position.

We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, trade marks and non-disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights.

Litigation may be necessary to attempt to enforce patents
issued to us, to protect our rights, or to defend third-party claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others. Patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country. Therefore, there can be no assurance
that patent issues will be uniformly resolved, or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits.

Government Regulations

Our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety, efficacy and adherence to FDA Quality System Regulation, or QSR, and related
manufacturing standards. Medical device products are subject to rigorous FDA and other governmental agency regulations in the United States and regulations of relevant foreign agencies abroad. The FDA regulates the introduction, manufacture,
advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution, and record keeping for such products, in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the United States are safe and effective for their intended use. In addition, the FDA is
authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions, fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspensions
or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, and criminal prosecution.

The FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a
new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval, or PMA, prior to it being introduced into the U.S. market. Our products currently

- 15 -


marketed in the United States are marketed in reliance on 510(k) pre-marketing clearances as either Class I or Class II devices. The process of obtaining a
Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data, which in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market
prior to 1976 or to a device that has been found by the FDA to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre-1976 device. As a result, FDA approval requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time. In
addition, in some cases, the FDA may require additional review by an advisory panel, which can further lengthen the process. The PMA process, which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for
high risk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life, may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information.

As a medical device manufacturer, all of our domestic and Australian manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a
routine basis by the FDA. We believe that our design, manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with the FDA’s regulatory requirements. MAP’s facilities are not subject to FDA regulation, because none of
MAP’s products are currently marketed in the United States.

Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Approval for sale of our medical devices in Europe is through the CE mark process. Where appropriate, our
products are CE marked to the European Union’s Medical Device Directive. Under the CE marketing scheme, our products are classified as either Class I or Class II; our devices are listed in the United States with FDA; in Australia with the
Therapeutic Goods Administration, or TGA; and in Canada with Health Canada.

Employees

As of June
30, 2004, we had 1,520 employees or full time consultants, of which 599 persons were employed in warehousing and manufacturing, 225 in research and development, 696 in sales, marketing and administration. Of our employees and consultants, 740 were
located in Australia, 382 in the United States, 387 in Europe and 11 in Asia.

We believe that the success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our
relationship with our employees is good.

ROCEEDINGS

The Company was engaged in litigation relating to the enforcement and defense of certain of its patents during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.

1995 Litigation with
Respironics.

In January 1995, our subsidiary, ResMed Limited, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California seeking monetary damages from and injunctive relief against
Respironics, Inc. for alleged infringement of three of its patents. In February 1995, Respironics filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, in Pittsburgh, against ResMed Limited seeking a declaratory
judgment that Respironics, Inc. does not infringe claims of these patents and that ResMed Limited’s patents are invalid and unenforceable.

On September 5, 2003, ResMed and Respironics settled this action. ResMed and Respironics have dismissed all claims in the action with prejudice.

- 18 -


2002 Litigation with Respironics.

On October 11, 2002, ResMed Inc, ResMed
Corp, and ResMed Limited filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, in San Diego against Respironics, Inc. ResMed’s suit seeking a judgment that certain of Respironics’ mask products (Contour Deluxe,
Comfort Classic, Comfort Select, and Image3 masks) infringe patents held by ResMed. The complaint further charged Respironics with copying ResMed’s proprietary mask technology, and alleged violation of the Lanham Act, trademark and trade dress
infringement, and common law violations relating to the appearance of ResMed’s mask products. ResMed sought an injunction and damages. On March 4, 2003, the Court denied Respironics’ motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court
for the Western District of Pennsylvania.

On October 16, 2002
Respironics, Inc. filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, in Pittsburgh, against ResMed Limited seeking a declaratory judgment that Respironics, Inc. does not infringe the patents that are the subject of
ResMed’s October 11, 2002 complaint filed in San Diego, that such patents are invalid and unenforceable and that Respironics has not committed any other trademark, trade dress or common law violations. On July 29, 2003, the court ordered the
case transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California.

On September 5, 2003, ResMed and Respironics settled both lawsuits involved in the 2002 Litigation. ResMed and Respironics have dismissed all claims in the actions with prejudice.

2002 Litigation with Fisher & Paykel
Healthcare.

On August 26, 2002, ResMed Inc., ResMed Corp. and ResMed Limited filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, in San Diego against Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Inc and
Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Limited (“Fisher & Paykel Healthcare”). ResMed’s amended complaint sought a judgment that selected Fisher & Paykel Healthcare mask products infringe patents held by ResMed. The complaint further
charged the defendants with the copying of ResMed proprietary mask technology and alleges violations of the Lanham Act, trademark and trade dress infringement and common law violations relating to the appearance of ResMed mask products.

On May 6, 2003, ResMed and Fisher & Paykel Healthcare agreed to settle
this patent infringement lawsuit. In accordance with the settlement, Fisher & Paykel introduced a new design of its mask in the United States and ResMed will not assert intellectual property claims against the new mask. ResMed has dismissed the
lawsuit with prejudice.

Other
Litigation.

In addition to the matters described above, in the normal course of business, we are subject to routine litigation incidental to our business. While the results of this litigation cannot be predicted with
certainty, we believe that their final outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

ECURITIES

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the
symbol “RMD”. The following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated the high and low closing prices for the common stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange.

As of August 20,
2004, there were 64 holders of record of our common stock. We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our initial public offering of our common stock and we do not currently intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
We anticipate that all of our earnings and other cash resources, if any, will be retained for the operation and expansion of our business and for general corporate purposes.

Sale of Unregistered Securities

On June 20, 2001, we issued $150.0 million of 4% convertible subordinated notes due 2006 to initial purchasers including
Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Banc Alex Brown Inc., William Blair & Company, LLC, Macquarie Bank, and UBS Warburg LLC. The discount to the initial purchasers on their purchase of the notes was $4.7 million. On July 3, 2001, we issued an additional
$30.0 million in notes to the initial purchasers upon exercise of the initial purchasers’ over allotment option, with an additional discount to the initial purchasers of $0.9 million. This increased the total amount of convertible subordinated
notes issued to $180.0 million, with a total discount to the initial purchasers of $5.6 million.

During fiscal 2003 and 2002, we repurchased $10.0 million and $56.8 million face value of our convertible subordinated notes respectively. The total
purchase price of the notes was $9.4 million and $49.1 million, including $0.2 million and $0.6 million in accrued interest. We recognized a gain of $0.3 million and $4.0 million, net of tax of $0.2 million and $2.5 million, on these transactions.
We did not repurchase any notes in fiscal 2004. At June 30, 2004, we had convertible subordinated notes outstanding of $113.25 million.

The notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes (the “Securities”) were not registered under the Securities Act or any
other state or foreign securities laws at the time of issue. The notes were offered and sold only to “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A or in offshore transactions outside the United States that met the requirements
of Rule 903 of Regulation S under the Securities Act.

The
Securities were subsequently registered for resale under the Securities Act (Registration No. 333-70500) effective October 9, 2001; and consequently the Securities may be resold in accordance with the prospectus that is part of the registration
statement by the selling security holders named in the prospectus or a supplement to the prospectus. Other sales of the Securities may only be made in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act and all other applicable
securities laws, or pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws.

- 20 -


The notes are subject to an indenture between us and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as
trustee. The notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time on or prior to maturity, into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $60.60 per share, which is equal to a conversion rate of 16.5017 shares per $1,000
principal amount of notes. The conversion price is subject to adjustment. The notes bear interest at 4% per year, payable semiannually on June 20 and December 20 of each year.

We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after June 20, 2004, but prior to June 20, 2005, at a redemption
price equal to 101.6% of the principal amount of notes redeemed and at any time after June 19, 2005, at a redemption price equal to 100.8% of the principal amount of notes redeemed, plus in any case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
redemption date, if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day before the date of mailing of
the optional redemption notice.

The notes are general
unsecured obligations and are subordinated to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness and will be effectively subordinated to all of the indebtedness and liabilities of our subsidiaries. The indenture governing the notes does not limit
the incurrence by us or our subsidiaries of senior indebtedness or other indebtedness. The notes mature on June 20, 2006.

On May 14, 2002, we issued 853,448 shares of our common stock to one individual as partial consideration for our acquisition of Servo Magnetics
Incorporated. We relied on the exemption from registration provided under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. No solicitation was made in connection with this issuance, other than negotiation of the acquisition, and we obtained
representations from the recipient regarding his investment intent, experience and sophistication. These shares were subsequently registered for resale under the Securities Act (Registration No. 335-100825), effective March 26, 2003; and
consequently the shares may be resold in accordance with the prospectus that was part of the Registration Statement by the selling stockholder named in the prospectus or in a supplement to the prospectus.

Other sales of the shares may only be made in compliance with the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and all other applicable securities laws, or pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities
laws.

Purchases of Equity Securities

The following table summarizes purchases by us of our common stock during
the three months ended June 30, 2004:

- 21 -


(1)

On June 6, 2002, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to 4.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock. There is no expiration date for the
repurchase of these shares. For the years ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, we repurchased 471,000 and 125,000 shares at a cost of $19.0 million and $3.5 million respectively. As at June 30, 2004, we have repurchased a total of 886,000 shares at a cost
of $30.4 million. We may continue to repurchase shares of our common stock for cash in the open market, or in negotiated or block transactions, from time to time as market and business conditions warrant.

Overview

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and
consolidated financial statements and notes, included herein.

We design, manufacture and market equipment for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea. Our net revenues are generated from the sale and rental of our various flow generator
devices, nasal mask systems, accessories and other products, and, to a lesser extent from royalties and sales of custom motors.

We have invested significant resources in research and development and product enhancement. Since 1989, we have developed several innovations to the
original CPAP device to increase patient comfort and to improve ease of product use. We have been developing products for automated treatment, titration and monitoring of OSA, such as the AutoSet T and AutoSet Spirit flow generators.

Business Acquisitions

Fiscal year ended June 30, 2004

On July 2, 2003 we acquired the assets of Respro Medical Company Limited
(“Respro”), our Hong Kong distributor for total consideration of $184,000 in cash. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, the results of operations of Respro have been included within our consolidated
financial statements from July 2, 2003. An amount of $89,000, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired of $95,000, has been recorded as goodwill.

Fiscal year ended June 30, 2003

John Stark and Associates.

On July 24, 2002 we
acquired the business of John Stark and Associates, our Texas representative, for total consideration of $300,000 in cash. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, the results of operations of John Stark and Associates
were included within our consolidated financial statements from July 24, 2002. An amount of $300,000, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired of $nil, has been recorded as goodwill.

Fiscal year ended June 30, 2002

Labhardt Acquisition.

On November 15, 2001, we
acquired all the common stock of Labhardt AG, our Swiss distributor, for total cash consideration, including acquisition costs, of $5.5 million.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, the results of operations of Labhardt AG have been included in our consolidated
financial statements from November 15, 2001. An amount of $4.2 million, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired of $1.3 million, has been recorded as goodwill.

SMI Acquisition.

On May 14, 2002, we acquired
all of the common stock of Servo Magnetics Incorporated (“SMI”) through a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary, Servo Magnetics Acquisition Inc, for total consideration, including acquisition costs, of $32.6 million. Consideration
included the issue of 853,448 shares for fair value of $24.8 million with the balance of the acquisition price paid in cash. Upon consummation of the merger, the surviving corporation, Servo Magnetics Acquisition Inc., changed its name to Servo
Magnetics Inc.

- 23 -


The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, the results of operations of SMI
have been included in our consolidated financial statements from May 14, 2002. An amount of $30.7 million, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired of $1.9 million, has been recorded
as goodwill.

Purchased in-process research and development of
$0.4 million was expensed upon acquisition of SMI because technological feasibility of the products under development had not been established and no further alternative uses existed. The value of in-process technology was calculated by identifying
research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established, estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from such
products, discounting the net cash flows to present value, and applying the reduced percentage completion of the projects thereto. The discount rate used in the analysis was 19% and was based on the risk profile of the acquired assets.

Purchased research and development projects related to electrical motor
systems used in our flow generator devices and other medical and data storage equipment. Key assumptions used in the analysis included gross margins of 34%. The majority of the new motor systems have been completed and have performed in line with
expectations at the time of acquisition.

In-Process
Research and Development Charge

On acquisition of MAP
Medizin-Technologie GmbH (MAP) in February 2001, we recognized as an expense a charge of $17.7 million with respect to five in-process research and development programs under active development by MAP at date of acquisition. The five projects were:

(i)

A single-walled nasal cushion mask system.

(ii)

A new headgear system

(iii)

A standalone active humidifier

(iv)

An autotitration CPAP device for treatment of OSA

(v)

A new OSA diagnostic screening device.

The status of each project as of June 30, 2004 is noted below:

(i)

Single-walled nasal cushion

The nasal cushion under development by MAP on acquisition was originally due for release in October 2001. Delays in the design and manufacturing process
delayed the release for seven months, until April 2002. The delay in release of the product was not significant over its expected life cycle, and has made no significant impact on the net return assumptions used in the initial in-process research
and development model. Since release, the product (now referred to as the Papillon) has met or exceeded all sales forecasts.

(ii)

New headgear

The new headgear product line was withheld to coincide with the release of the Papillon mask system in April 2002 and so was also seven months behind
schedule in projected release dates. Since release, the new headgear system has exceeded original sales projections and continues to meet or exceed initial expectations.

(iii)

Standalone active humidifier

Due to other priorities and to the introduction of integrated humidification flow generator devices by a number of competitors during fiscal 2002, we
have abandoned the standalone humidifier project.

- 24 -


Given the relatively small revenue forecast of the product line in the in-process research and
development model, the financial impact of this project is not material to ResMed or the net return of the MAP acquisition.

(iv)

Auto titration CPAP Device

The main product development effort of MAP since acquisition has been on the completion of the Autotitration CPAP flow generator specified in the initial
in-process research and development charge, now referred to as the Magellan. This project experienced some delays due to the complexity of the software algorithm development process and associated electronics resulting in the product being released
in November 2002. Sales are now broadly consistent with our initial expectations.

(v)

OSA diagnostic screening device

MAP’s new diagnostic screening device, now called the microMESAM, was released in the German market in March 2004. We remain confident in the
capacity of the device to enhance the diagnostic process, and remain confident in the potential of the product to significantly impact the treatment and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in the German market.

As at June 30, 2004, four of the five programs have been completed with the
release of the Papillon mask system, upgraded headgear, Magellan flow generator and MicroMESAM.

Given the completion of the above research programs and performance of the associated product lines, we remain confident in the assumptions used to
determine the in-process research and development charge and, as a result, the net return of the MAP acquisition.

Tax Expense.

Our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized. To date, a
substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in Australia where the statutory rate was 30% in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002. During fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, our effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately 31% and
approximately 33%. These fluctuations have resulted from, and future effective tax rates will depend upon, numerous factors, including the amount of research and development expenditures for which a 125% Australian tax deduction is available, the
level of non-deductible expenses, and the use of available net operating loss carryforward deductions and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws.

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.

Fiscal Year Ended June 30 2004, Compared to
Fiscal Year Ended June 30 2003

Net
Revenues.

Net revenue increased for the year ended June 30, 2004 to $339.3 million from $273.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2003, an increase of $65.7 million or 24%.

The increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of
our flow generators, masks and accessories. Sales also benefited from an appreciation of international currencies against the

- 25 -


U.S. dollar (increasing sales by approximately $18.6 million). Net revenue in North and Latin America increased to $166.1 million from $130.7 million
for the years ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 respectively. This growth primarily reflects increased public and physician awareness of sleep-disordered breathing. Net revenue in international markets increased to $173.2 million from $142.8 million for
the years ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 respectively. International sales growth for the year ended June 30, 2004 reflects organic growth in the overall sleep-disordered breathing market and appreciation of international currencies against the U.S.
dollar. Sales for the previous year ended June 30, 2003 included non-recurring SARS-related sales to China of approximately $5.0 million. Excluding the impact of these sales, international sales grew by 26%. Excluding both the impacts of the
appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar and SARS-related sales, international sales grew by 12%.

Sales of flow generators for the year ended June 30, 2004 increased by 18% compared to the year ended June 30, 2003, including increases of 20% in North
and Latin America and 16% elsewhere. Sales of mask systems, motors and other accessories increased by 31%, including increases of 33% in North and Latin America and 29% elsewhere, for the year ended June 30, 2004 compared to the year ended June 30,
2003. These increases primarily reflect growth in the overall sleep-disordered breathing market and appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar.

Gross Profit.

Gross profit increased for the year ended June 30, 2004 to $216.7 million from
$173.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2003, an increase of $43.6 million or 25%. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased for the year ended June 30, 2004 to 64% from 63% for the year ended June 30, 2003. The small improvement in
gross margin reflects a more favorable product mix due to increased sales of higher margin products, partially offset by the impact of higher manufacturing costs resulting from a stronger Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar, as the majority of
manufacturing labor and overhead costs are incurred in Australia.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended June 30, 2004 to $104.7 million from $85.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2003, an
increase of $19.4 million or 23%. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2004 was 31%, consistent with the year ended June 30, 2003. The increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel and other expenses related to the increase in our sales. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was also attributable
to appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar which added approximately $8.1 million to our expenses as reported in U.S. dollars.

Donations to Foundation.

In the year ended June 30, 2004 we donated $0.5 million to the ResMed Sleep Disordered Breathing
Foundation. The Foundation’s overall mission is to educate both the public and physicians about the inherent dangers of untreated SDB/OSA, particularly as it relates to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease.

Research and Development Expenses.

Research and
development expenses increased for the year ended June 30, 2004 to $26.2 million from $20.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2003, an increase of $5.7 million or 28%. As a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 7.7% for
the year ended June 30, 2004 compared to 7.5% for the year ended June 30, 2003. The increase in research and development expenses was due to increased salaries associated with an increase in personnel and increased charges for consulting fees,
clinical trials and technical assessments incurred to facilitate development of new products. The increase also reflects an appreciation of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar, as the majority of research and development costs are incurred
in Australian dollars. The appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar added approximately $3.8 million to our research and development expenses as reported in U.S. dollars.

- 26 -


Other Income (Expense), Net.

Other expense, net increased for the year
ended June 30, 2004 to net expense of $0.7 million from net expense of $0.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2003. The increase in other expense was attributable to no gains on extinguishment of debt this year compared to $0.5 million for the
year ended June 30, 2003, and lower net foreign currency exchange gains, partially offset by lower interest expense due to the reduction in convertible note debt.

Income Taxes.

Our effective income tax rate increased to 32.3% for the year ended June 30,
2004 from 31.9% for the year ended June 30, 2003. The marginally higher tax rate was primarily due to the geographical mix of taxable income. We continue to benefit from the Australian corporate tax rate of 30%, because we generate a majority of our
taxable income in Australia.

Fiscal Year Ended June 30
2003, Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30 2002

Net
Revenues.

Net revenue increased for the year ended June 30, 2003 to $273.6 million from $204.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2002, an increase of $69.5 million or 34%.

The increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of
our flow generators and accessories. Sales also benefited from an appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar (increasing sales by approximately $16.8 million) and inclusion of sales of $6.5 million from Servo Magnetics
Inc. (SMI), the subsidiary we acquired in May 2002. Net revenue in North and Latin America increased to $130.7 million from $100.9 million for the years ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 respectively. This growth primarily reflects increased public and
physician awareness of sleep-disordered breathing. Net revenue in international markets increased to $142.8 million from $103.1 million for the years ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 respectively. International sales growth for the year ended June 30,
2003 reflects organic growth in the overall sleep-disordered breathing market, appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar and SARS-related sales to China of approximately $5.0 million.

Sales of flow generators for the year ended June 30, 2003 increased by 29%
compared to the year ended June 30, 2002 including increases of 23% in North and Latin America and 33% elsewhere. Sales of mask systems, motors and other accessories increased by 40% including increases of 35% in North and Latin America and 47%
elsewhere, for the year ended June 30, 2003 compared to the year ended June 30, 2002. These increases primarily reflect growth in the overall sleep-disordered breathing market, appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar and our
acquisition of SMI.

Gross
Profit.

Gross profit increased for the year ended June 30, 2003 to $173.1 million from $133.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2002, an increase of $39.9 million or 30%. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue
decreased for the year ended June 30, 2003 to 63% from 65% for the year ended June 30, 2002, reflecting the impact of higher manufacturing costs resulting from a stronger Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar, as the majority of manufacturing
labor and overhead costs are incurred in Australia and, to a lesser extent, the inclusion of SMI’s motor sales which achieve lower margins compared to our overall gross margin.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased for the year ended June 30, 2003 to $85.3 million from $64.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2002, an increase of $20.8 million or 32%. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended
June 30, 2003 decreased to 31% compared to 32% for the year ended June 30, 2002. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative personnel and other expenses
related to the increase in our sales. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was also attributable to appreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar (adding approximately $6.0 million), the inclusion of $2.6
million from SMI’s operations, and $2.2 million in litigation costs associated with outstanding patent infringement lawsuits against competitors.

- 27 -


Research and Development Expenses.

Research and development expenses
increased for the year ended June 30, 2003 to $20.5 million from $14.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2002, an increase of $5.6 million or 38%. As a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 7.5% for the year ended June
30, 2003 compared to 7.3% for the year ended June 30, 2002. The increase in research and development expenses was due to increased salaries associated with an increase in personnel and increased charges for consulting fees, clinical trials and
technical assessments incurred to facilitate development of new products. The increase also reflects an appreciation of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar, as the majority of research and development costs are incurred in Australian
dollars. In constant currency terms, research and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2003 increased by $3.1 million, or 17%, compared to the year ended June 30, 2002.

Other Income (Expense), Net.

Other income (expense), net decreased for the year ended June 30,
2003 to net expense of $0.1 million from net income of $3.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2002. The decrease in other income was attributable to lower gains on extinguishment of debt partially offset by increased net foreign currency exchange
gains, and lower interest expense due to the reduction in convertible note debt.

Income Taxes.

Our effective income tax rate increased to 31.9% for the year ended June 30, 2003 from 31.3% for the year ended June 30, 2002. The marginally higher tax rate was primarily
due to the geographical mix of taxable income. We continue to benefit from the Australian corporate tax rate of 30%, because we generate a majority of our taxable income in Australia.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of June 30, 2004 and June 30, 2003, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities available-for-sale of
$140.9 million and $121.0 million, respectively. Working capital was $217.2 million and $191.3 million at June 30, 2004 and June 30, 2003 respectively.

Inventories at June 30, 2004 increased by $6.4 million or 13% to $55.8 million compared to June 30, 2003 inventories of $49.4 million. The percentage
increase in inventories was less than the 24% incremental increase in revenues in the year ended June 30, 2004 compared to the year ended June 30, 2003. The lower inventory growth reflects the impact of the relocation of manufacturing to our new
facility at Norwest in Sydney in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 which temporarily lowered production volumes and consequently inventory balances at June 30, 2004. Accounts receivable at June 30, 2004 were $67.2 million, an increase of $10.5
million or 19% over the June 30, 2003 accounts receivable balance of $56.7 million. This increase was modestly lower than the 24% incremental increase in revenues for the year ended June 30, 2004 compared to the year ended June 30, 2003. Accounts
receivable days outstanding increased to 64 days for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, compared to 62 days for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. The increase reflected, in part, SARS-related sales to China of $5.0 million in the quarter ended June 30,
2003, which were collected prior to June 30, 2003. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total accounts receivable at June 30, 2004 and 2003 was 4.5% and 4.2%, respectively. The credit quality of our customers remains consistent
with our past experience.

During the year ended June 30, 2004,
we generated cash of $76.5 million from operations, primarily as a result of increased profit and improved working capital management, particularly in respect of inventories and accounts payable. During the year ended June 30, 2003 approximately
$59.3 million of cash was generated by operations.

Capital
expenditures for the years ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 aggregated $57.2 million and $25.6 million respectively. For the year ended June 30, 2004, $40.9 million of the expenditure related to the

- 28 -


construction of our new manufacturing facility. Capital expenditure was also incurred for the acquisition of computer hardware and software and the purchase
of production tooling and equipment. The capital expenditures in the year ended June 30, 2003 primarily reflected the construction of our new manufacturing facility, acquisition of computer hardware and software including a disaster recovery system,
and purchase of production tooling equipment. As a result of these capital expenditures, our balance sheet reflects net property, plant and equipment of approximately $147.3 million at June 30, 2004 compared to $104.7 million at June 30, 2003.

During the year ended June 30, 2004, we did not repurchase any
convertible subordinated notes.

For the year ended June 30,
2003 we repurchased $10.0 million face value of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes. The total purchase price of the notes was $9.4 million, including $0.2 million in accrued interest. We recognized a gain of $0.3 million, net of tax of
$0.2 million, on these transactions. At June 30, 2004, we had convertible subordinated notes outstanding of $113.2 million.

We may from time to time seek to retire our convertible subordinated notes through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities in open market
purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, and our current or future contractual obligations, if any, that may directly
or indirectly apply to such transactions.

On April 26, 2002,
we settled our purchase of a 30-acre site at Norwest Business Park, located northwest of Sydney, Australia. The acquisition cost was $23.6 million, including deferred payments of $5.7 million paid in October 2002 and $5.7 million paid in April 2003.
We completed the first building, a manufacturing facility on this site in May 2004. New research and development and office facilities are expected to be completed in May 2006. We estimate that the additional building costs for the new research and
development and office facilities will be approximately $54 million. We expect to fund the project through a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.

On June 6, 2002, the Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to 4.0 million shares of our outstanding common
stock. For the years ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, we repurchased 471,000 and 125,000 shares at a cost of $19.0 million and $3.5 million respectively. As at June 30, 2004, we have repurchased a total of 886,000 shares at a cost of $30.4 million. We
may continue to repurchase shares of our common stock for cash in the open market, or in negotiated or block transactions, from time to time as market and business conditions warrant.

Details of contractual obligations at June 30, 2004 are as follows:

- 29 -


Details of other commercial commitments at June 30, 2004 are as follows:

*

The above guarantees relate to guarantees required by statutory authorities as a pre-requisite to developing our site at Norwest and requirements under contractual obligations with
insurance companies transacting with our German subsidiaries.

The results of our international operations are affected by changes in exchange rates between currencies. Changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated net revenue and gross profit margins from
international operations. We are exposed to the risk that the dollar value equivalent of anticipated cash flows would be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We manage this risk through foreign currency option contracts.

We expect to satisfy all of our short term and long-term
liquidity requirements through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations and a $15.0 million undrawn revolving line of credit with Union Bank of California.

Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates,
including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, warranty obligations, goodwill, impaired assets, intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies.

We state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and
analysis. The estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.

We believe that the following
critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:

(1)    Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.    We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments, which results in bad debt expense. We determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables, considering a customer’s
financial condition, credit history and current economic conditions. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

(2)    Inventory
Adjustments.    Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the first-in, first-out method. We review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on
estimated future usage and sales. The likelihood of any material inventory write-downs is dependent on changes in competitive conditions, new product introductions by us or our competitors, or rapid changes in customer demand.

- 30 -


(3)    Valuation of Goodwill, Intangible and Other Long-Lived
Assets.    We use assumptions in establishing the carrying value, fair value and estimated lives of our long-lived assets and goodwill. The criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the
asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset, as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our
business objectives. If assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense are
based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. Factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability
to generate positive cash flow, loss of legal ownership or title to the asset, a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends, significant changes in our strategic business objectives, utilization of the
asset, and a significant change in the economic and/or political conditions in certain countries.

(4)    Valuation of Deferred Income Taxes.    Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable
income, the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in, and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations.

(5)    Provision for Warranty.    We
provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The amount of this provision is determined by using a financial model, which takes into consideration actual, historical expenses and potential risks
associated with our different products. This financial model is then used to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision. Although we engage in product improvement programs and
processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures. Should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates,
revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required.

(6)    Revenue Recognition.    Revenue on product sales is recorded at the time of shipment, at which time title transfers to the customer. Revenue on product sales which require customer acceptance
is not recorded until acceptance is received. Royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded when earned. Service revenue received in advance from service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the service
contract. Revenue received in advance from rental unit contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract. Revenue from sale of marketing and distribution rights is initially deferred and recognized ratably
as revenue over the life of the contract. Freight charges billed to customers are included in revenue. All freight-related expenses are charged to cost of sales.

We do not offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products or similarly offer variable
sale prices for subsequent events or activities. However, as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders, one time special pricing to support new product introductions, sales rebates for centralized purchasing
entities or price-breaks for regular order volumes. The costs of all such programs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue. In our domestic sales activities we use a number of Manufacturer Representatives to sell our products. These representatives
are paid a direct commission on sales and act as an integral component of our domestic sales force. We do not sell our products to these representatives, and do not recognize revenue on such shipments. Our products are predominantly therapy-based
equipment and require no installation. As such, we have no significant installation obligations.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”)
No. 104, “Revenue Recognition” which codifies, revises and rescinds certain sections of SAB No. 101, “Revenue Recognition”, in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing
guidance and SEC rules and regulations. The changes noted in SAB No. 104 did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position or consolidated cash flows.

In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued statement of financial accounting standard (“SFAS”) 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS 150 requires that certain financial instruments, which under previous
guidance were accounted for as equity, must now be accounted for as liabilities. The financial instruments affected include mandatory redeemable stock, certain financial instruments that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its
shares in exchange for cash or other assets and certain obligations that can be settled with shares of stock.

SFAS 150 is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first
interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. We adopted SFAS No. 150 effective July 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operation.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which addresses the consolidation of certain entities (“variable interest entities”) in which an enterprise has a controlling financial interest through other than voting interests. FIN 46
requires that a variable interest entity be consolidated by the holder of the majority of the expected risks and rewards associated with the activities of the variable interest entity. FIN 46 was effective for variable interest entities entered into
prior to February 1, 2003 in periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46, to clarify some
requirements and add new scope exceptions. The revised guidance is effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2003. The adoption of the provisions of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on our financial condition or
results of operations.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS
149, Amendment of SFAS 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for
hedging activities under SFAS 133. SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) issued
EITF Issue No. 00-21 “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables”. EITF Issue No. 00-21 addresses how to determine whether a revenue arrangement involving multiple deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting
for the purposes of revenue recognition and how the revenue arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting. EITF Issue No. 00-21 applies to revenue arrangements entered into after June 15, 2003. The
adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Foreign Currency Market Risk

Our functional
currency is the U.S. dollar, although the financial statements of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are maintained in their respective local currencies, and as such we transact business in various foreign currencies, including a number of major European
currencies as well as the Australian dollar. We have significant foreign currency exposure through both our Australian manufacturing activities and international sales operations.

We have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased currency options to hedge
foreign-currency-denominated financial assets, liabilities and manufacturing expenditure. The goal of this hedging program is to economically guarantee or lock in the exchange rates on our foreign currency exposures denominated in Euro’s and
the Australian dollar. Under this program, increases or decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated financial assets, liabilities, and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments. We have determined our
hedge program to be a non-effective hedge as defined under SFAS 133. The foreign currency derivatives portfolio is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and included in other assets or other liabilities. All movements in the fair
value of the foreign curency derivatives are recorded within other income, net on our consolidated statements of income.

The table below provides information (in U.S. dollars) on our foreign-currency-denominated financial assets by legal entity functional currency as of June
30, 2004 (in thousands):

- 33 -


The table below provides information about our foreign currency derivative financial instruments and
presents the information in U.S. dollar equivalents. The table summarizes information on instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates, including foreign currency call options held at June 30, 2004. The table
presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by contractual maturity dates for our foreign currency derivative financial instruments. These notional amounts generally are used to calculate payments to be exchanged under the
options contracts.

Interest Rate
Risk

We are exposed to risk associated with changes in
interest rates affecting the return on our investments.

At
June 30, 2004, we maintained a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less. We maintain a short-term investment portfolio containing financial instruments in which the majority
have original maturities of greater than three months but less than twelve months. These financial instruments, principally comprised of corporate obligations, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase.

A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates during
the twelve months ended June 30, 2004, would have resulted in approximately $0.2 million change in pretax income. In addition, the value of our marketable securities would change by approximately $0.3 million following a hypothetical 100 basis point
change in interest rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.

Forward-Looking Statements

This report on Form 10-K contains or may contain certain forward-looking statements and information that are based on our management’s beliefs, as
well as on estimates and assumptions made by, and information currently available to our management. The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “future” and other
similar expressions generally identify forward-looking statements, including, in particular, statements regarding the development and approval of new products and product applications, market expansion, pending litigation and the development of new
markets for our products, such as the cardiovascular and stroke markets. These forward-looking statements are made under the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should not unduly rely on these
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect the views of our management at the time the statements are made and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions, including, without limitation, and in
addition to those identified in the text surrounding such statements, those identified below and elsewhere in this report. In addition, important factors to consider in evaluating such forward-looking statements include changes or developments in
social, economic, market, legal or regulatory circumstances, changes in our business or growth strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due

- 34 -


to changes in our industry or the economy generally, the emergence of new or growing competitors, the actions or omissions of third parties, including
suppliers, customers, competitors and governmental authorities, and various other factors. Should any one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or the underlying estimates or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary
significantly from those expressed in such forward-looking statements, and there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this report will in fact occur.

Risk Factors

The risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations include the following:

Our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our
business.

The markets for our sleep-disordered breathing products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology. Our ability to compete successfully depends, in part,
on our ability to develop innovative new products and to be the first to market with those products. The development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that
our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete.

Additionally, some of our competitors have greater financial, research and development, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. The past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the health care industry and in the
markets for our products. Industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources or if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours. This competition could increase
pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing. If we are unable to develop innovative new products, maintain competitive pricing, and offer
products that consumers perceive to be as reliable as those of our competitors, our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business.

Our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home health care products and sleep clinics.

We
market our products primarily to home health care dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep disorders. We believe that home health care dealers and sleep clinics play a significant role in determining which
brand of product a patient will use. The success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to home health care dealers and sleep clinics to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these third parties.

We have limited resources to market to the more than 2,500
U.S. sleep clinics and the more than 4,000 home health care dealer branch locations, most of which use, sell or recommend several brands of products. In addition, home health care dealers have experienced price pressures as government and
third-party reimbursement have declined for home care products, and home health care dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us. We cannot assure you that sleep clinic physicians will
continue to prescribe our products, or that home health care dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written.

We have expanded our marketing activities to target the population with a predisposition to sleep- disordered breathing as
well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists. We cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness of our products.

Any inability to effectively market our products outside the U.S. could impact our
profitability.

Approximately half our revenues are generated outside the U.S., in approximately 60 different countries. Many of these countries have unique regulatory, medical, and business environments. If we are unable
to effectively market our products outside the U.S., our overall financial performance could decline.

If we are unable to support our continued growth, our business could suffer.

We have experienced rapid and substantial
growth. As we continue to grow, the complexity of our operations increases, placing greater demands on our management. Our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management
information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business. Unexpected difficulties during expansion, the failure to attract and retain qualified employees, the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management
information systems, the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop. If we fail to manage our growth, our business could suffer.

If we fail to integrate our acquisitions with our operations, our business
could suffer.

The integration of our acquired operations requires significant efforts from our company and the acquired entity, for several years after each acquisition. Although we acquired our MAP subsidiary in February
2001, our Labhardt subsidiary in November 2001, and our Servo Magnetics subsidiary in May 2002, we continue to adjust our business strategies, equipment, and personnel to achieve maximum efficiencies and success. If we are not able to successfully
integrate the operations of our acquired entities, we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions.

We manufacture substantially all of our products outside the U.S. and sell a significant portion of our products in non-U.S. markets, subjecting us to
various risks relating to international activities that could adversely affect our overall profitability.

Sales outside North and Latin America accounted for approximately 51%, 52%, and 51% of our net revenues in fiscal
years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 50% of our net revenues in the foreseeable future. Our sales outside of North America and our operations in Europe, Australia and Asia
are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in our U.S. operations, including:

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•

tariffs and other trade barriers;

•

compliance with foreign medical device manufacturing regulations;

•

reduction in third party payer reimbursement for our products;

•

inability to obtain import licenses;

•

changes in trade policies and in U.S. and foreign tax policies;

•

possible changes in export or import restrictions; and

•

the modification or introduction of other governmental policies with potentially adverse effects.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and
earnings.

Since our international sales and a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in local currencies and not in U.S. dollars, our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates. We had foreign currency transaction losses in recent periods and may have further losses in the future. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our business and that a significant
portion of our manufacturing costs will continue to be denominated in Australian dollars.

- 36 -


Government and private insurance plans may not reimburse patients for our products, which could result
in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products.

Our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of our products will be available from government health
administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. These third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Therefore, even if a product is approved for marketing, we
cannot assure you that reimbursement will be allowed for the product, that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or, that the reimbursement amount even if initially adequate, will not subsequently be reduced. For example, in some markets, such
as Spain, France and Germany, government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products but is subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations. In other markets, such as Australia and the United
Kingdom, there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleep-disordered breathing conditions. Additionally, future legislation or regulation concerning the health care industry or third party or governmental coverage and
reimbursement, particularly legislation or regulation limiting consumers’ reimbursement rights, may harm our business.

As we continue to develop new products, those products will generally not qualify for reimbursement, if at all, until they are approved for marketing. In
the United States, we sell our products primarily to home health care dealers and to sleep clinics. We do not file claims and bill governmental programs and other third party payers directly for reimbursement for our products. However, we are still
subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental reimbursement programs, particularly Medicaid and Medicare.

In particular, the federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration,
directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
The government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us. Many states and other governments have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Law. We are also
subject to other federal and state fraud laws applicable to payment from any third party payer. These laws prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully filing false claims or executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including
private third party payers. These laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage, coding, and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill third party payers. Any violation of these laws and
regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties, including fines.

In addition to reimbursement for our products, our customers depend in part on reimbursement by government and private health insurers for other products. During fiscal year 2004, the US Government proposed reductions
in reimbursement rates for some of these other products. Such proposed reductions, if they occur, may have a material impact on our customers. Any material impact on our customers may indirectly affect our sales to those customers, or the
collectibility of receivables we have from those customers.

Complying with Food and Drug Administration and other regulations is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties.

We are subject to various federal,
state, local and international regulations regarding our business activities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in, among other things, recalls of our products, substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our
employees. A recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs, damage our reputation, and materially affect operating results.

- 37 -


Product sales, introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of the FDA or
similar foreign regulations, which could cause our sales and profits to decline.

Before we can market or sell a new medical device in the United States, we must obtain FDA clearance, which can be a lengthy and
time-consuming process. We generally receive clearance from the FDA to market our products in the United States under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or our products are exempt from the 510(k) clearance process. We have
modified some of our 510(k) approved products without submitting new 510(k) notices, which we do not believe were required. However, if the FDA disagrees with us and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications for modifications to our existing
products, we may be required to stop marketing the products while the FDA reviews the 510(k) notification.

Any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier, more rigorous FDA examination process. For example, in
certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product prior to submitting a 510(k) notice. Additionally, we may be required to obtain premarket approvals for our products. The requirements of these more rigorous processes could delay
product introductions and increase the costs associated with FDA compliance. Marketing and sale of our products outside the United States are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals, and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals,
our sales could suffer.

We cannot assure you that any new
products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from U.S. or foreign regulatory agencies.

Off-label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties.

Clearance under Section 510(k) only permits us to
market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the FDA. We may request additional label indications for our current products, and the FDA may deny those requests outright, require additional expensive clinical data to support
any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance. If the FDA determines that we have marketed our products for off-label use, we could be subject to fines, injunctions or other
penalties.

Disruptions in the supply of components from our
single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability.

We purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from various suppliers, including some who are single-source suppliers
for us. We cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or, in the alternative, that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part. A
reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components, or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part, would limit our ability to manufacture our devices, which could result in a significant reduction in
sales and profitability. We cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply.

Our intellectual property may not protect our products, and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third
parties.

We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain United States and foreign
patent protection for our products, their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. We have a number of pending patent applications, and we do not know whether
any patents will issue from any of these applications. We do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially
valuable. Legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving, and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims. Additionally, there may be third party patents,

- 38 -


patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our
products.

We face the risks that:

•

third parties will infringe our intellectual property rights;

•

our non-disclosure agreements will be breached;

•

we will not have adequate remedies for infringement;

•

our trade secrets will become known to or independently developed by our competitors; or

•

third parties will be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or require us to license and pay fees or royalties in order for us to be able to market some of our
products.

Litigation may be necessary to enforce
patents issued to us, to protect our proprietary rights, or to defend third party claims that we have infringed upon proprietary rights of others. The defense and prosecution of patent claims, including these pending claims, as well as participation
in other inter-party proceedings, can be expensive and time consuming, even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us. If the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse, we could be subject to
significant liabilities to third parties, could be required to obtain licenses from third parties or could be required to cease sales of the affected products. Additionally, the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to
country, and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved, or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits.

We are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage,
which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims.

We are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. Any product liability claim brought
against us, with or without merit, could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates. In addition, we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits. Our insurance policies have various exclusions,
and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage, in which case, we may have to pay the entire amount of any award. We cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims
brought against us will be covered by our insurance. Insurance varies in cost and can be difficult to obtain, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. A successful product
liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage, if any, may require us to pay substantial amounts, which could harm our business.

We are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions.

From time to time we may be audited by the
tax authorities and were subject to tax audits in France, the U.S. and Germany during the year ended June 30, 2004. The tax audits in France and the U.S. were concluded in the year ended June 30, 2004 with no material adjustments. The German tax
audit remains ongoing. Any assessment resulting from this audit could result in material changes to our past or future taxable income, tax payable or deferred tax assets, and could require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially
adversely affect our financial results.

Our quarterly
operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons.

Our operating results have, from time to time, fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future. These
fluctuations may result from a number of factors, including:

•

the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;

•

the geographic mix of product sales;

- 39 -


•

the success of our marketing efforts in new regions;

•

changes in third party reimbursement;

•

timing of regulatory clearances and approvals;

•

timing of orders by distributors;

•

expenditures incurred for research and development;

•

competitive pricing in different regions;

•

seasonality;

•

the cost and effect of promotional and marketing programs;

•

the effect of foreign currency transaction gains or losses; and

•

other activities of our competitors.

If a natural or man-made disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities, we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time
and our sales and profitability will decline.

Our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead-time to repair or replace. The
facilities may be affected by natural or man-made disasters and in the event it was affected by a disaster, we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers. Although we believe we possess adequate insurance for damage to our property and the
disruption of our business from casualties, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.

Delaware law, provisions in our charter and our shareholder rights plan
could make it difficult for another company to acquire us.

Provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or
our security holders. In particular, our board of directors is divided into three classes, serving for staggered three-year terms. Because of this classification it will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors constituting a majority
of our board of directors.

Additionally, our board of
directors has the authority to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders.
Under our stockholder rights plan, we have also issued purchase rights to the holders of our common stock that entitle those holders to purchase our Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a discount, under certain circumstances. The rights
of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or
preventing a change in control, may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our
common stock.

You may not be able to enforce the judgments
of U.S. courts against some of our assets or officers and directors.

A substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States. Additionally, two of our seven directors and two of our five executive
officers reside outside the United States, along with all or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments of U.S. courts relating to any liabilities under U.S.
securities laws against our assets, those persons or their assets. In addition, we have been advised by our Australian counsel that some doubt exists as to the ability of investors to pursue claims based on U.S. securities laws against these assets
or these persons in Australian courts.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such

- 41 -


information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2004. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

ResMed Inc:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ResMed Inc and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2004, and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2004. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Public Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ResMed Inc. and subsidiaries
as of June 30, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 142 “Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” and changed its method of accounting for goodwill in 2002 accordingly.

(1)

Organization and Basis of Presentation

ResMed Inc. (the “Company”) is a Delaware Corporation formed in March 1994 as a holding company for the ResMed Group. Through our subsidiaries,
we design, manufacture and market devices for the evaluation and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing, primarily obstructive sleep apnea. Our manufacturing operations are located in Australia, Germany, and the United States of America. Major
distribution and sales sites are located in the United States of America, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Australia and Sweden.

(2)

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from management’s estimates.

(b)

Revenue Recognition

Revenue on product sales is generally recorded upon shipment, at which time title transfers to the customer. Revenue on product sales which require
customer acceptance is not recorded until acceptance is received. Royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded when earned. Service revenue received in advance from service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life
of the service contract. Revenue received in advance from rental unit contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract. Revenue from sale of marketing or distribution rights is initially deferred and
recognized ratably as revenue over the life of the contract. Freight charges billed to customers are included in revenue. All freight-related expenses are charged to cost of sales.

We do not offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products, other than returns for product
defects or other warranty claims, nor do we offer variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities. However, as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders, one time special pricing to support new product
introductions, sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or price-breaks for regular order volumes. The costs of all such programs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue. In our U.S. sales activities we use a number of manufacturer
representatives to sell our products. These representatives are paid a direct commission on sales and act as an integral component of our U.S. sales force. We do not sell our products to these representatives and do not recognize revenue on such
shipments. Our products are predominantly therapy-based equipment and require no installation. As such, we have no significant installation obligations.

(c)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents include certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and other highly liquid investments are stated at cost, which approximates market.
Investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are considered to be cash equivalents for purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued

(d)

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined principally by the first-in, first-out method, or net realizable value. We review and provide for any product obsolescence in our manufacturing and distribution
operations with assessments of individual products and components (based on estimated future usage and sales) being performed throughout the year.

(e)

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment, including rental equipment, is recorded at cost. Depreciation expense is computed using the straight–line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to ten years except for buildings which are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 40 years. Straight–line and accelerated methods of depreciation are used for tax purposes.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.

(f)

Patents

The registration costs for new patents are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the patent, generally five years. In the event of a patent being superseded, the unamortized costs are written off
immediately.

(g)

Goodwill

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As allowed under the Standard,
we adopted SFAS 142 effective July 1, 2001. SFAS 142 requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually.

With the adoption of SFAS 142, we reassessed the useful lives and residual
values of all acquired intangible assets to make any necessary amortization period adjustments. Based on that assessment only, goodwill was determined to have an indefinite useful life and no adjustments were made to the amortization period or
residual values of other intangible assets.

We conducted our
annual review for goodwill impairment as at June 30, 2004. In conducting our review of goodwill impairment, we identified reporting units, being components of our operating segment, as each of the entities acquired and giving rise to the goodwill.
The fair value for each reporting unit was determined based on discounted cash flows and involved a two step process as follows:

Step 1-

Compare the fair value for each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. For each reporting unit where the carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds the reporting
unit’s fair value, move on to step 2. If a reporting unit’s fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary.

Goodwill (continued)

Step 2-

Allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non-goodwill intangible assets and liabilities. This will derive an implied fair value for the goodwill. Then,
compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill,
an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess.

The results of the
review indicated that no impaired goodwill exists.

(h)

Foreign Currency

The consolidated financial statements of our non–U.S. subsidiaries, whose functional currencies are other than U.S. dollars, are translated into U.S.
dollars for financial reporting purposes. Assets and liabilities of non–U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated at period end exchange rates, and revenue and expense transactions are
translated at average exchange rates for the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are recognized as part of comprehensive income, as described in Note 6, and are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance
sheet until such time as the subsidiary is sold or substantially or completely liquidated. Gains and losses on transactions denominated in other than the functional currency of the entity are reflected in operations.

(i)

Research and Development

Research and development costs are expensed in the period incurred.

Earnings Per Share

The weighted average shares used to calculate basic earnings per share were 33,694,000, 33,054,000, and 32,174,000 for the years ended June 30, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. The difference between basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share is attributable to the impact of outstanding stock options during the periods presented. Stock options had the effect of increasing the number of
shares used in the calculation (by application of the treasury stock method) by 1,431,000, 1,385,000 and 1,906,000 for the years ended June 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Stock options of 751,000, 1,408,000 and 726,000 for the years ended June 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively, were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as the effect of exercising these options would have been anti-dilutive.

Financial Instruments

The carrying value of financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities available-for-sale, accounts receivable and accounts
payable approximate their fair value because of their short-term nature. The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt at June 30, 2004

Financial Instruments (continued)

approximates $119.9 million compared with the carrying value of $113.3 million. Foreign currency option contracts are marked to market and therefore reflect
their fair value. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

The fair value of financial instruments is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.

(l)

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

We enter into various types of foreign exchange contracts in managing our foreign exchange risk, including derivative financial instruments encompassing
forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options.

The
purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect us from adverse exchange rate fluctuations with respect to net cash movements resulting from the sales of products to foreign customers and Australian manufacturing activities. We
enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated sales and manufacturing costs, principally denominated in Australian dollars and Euros. The terms of such foreign currency option contracts generally do not exceed three years.

Our foreign currency derivatives portfolio represents a cash
flow hedge program against the net cash flow of our international manufacturing operations. We have determined our hedge program to be a non-effective hedge as defined under SFAS 133. The foreign currency derivatives portfolio is recorded in the
consolidated balance sheets at fair value and included in other assets or other liabilities.

All movements in the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives are recorded within other income, net on our consolidated statements of income.

We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counter parties to financial instruments. The
credit exposure of foreign exchange options at June 30, 2004 and June 30, 2003 was $2.0 million and $2.6 million respectively, which represents the positive fair value of options held by us.

We held foreign currency option contracts with notional amounts totaling
$140.6 million and $124.5 million at June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively to hedge foreign currency items. These contracts mature at various dates prior to July 2006.

(m)

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Marketable Securities

Management determines the appropriate classification of our investments in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such
determination at each balance sheet date. Debt securities for which we do not have the intent or ability to hold to maturity are classified as available-for-sale. Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and
losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive income.

At June 30, 2004 and 2003, the investments in debt securities were classified on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as marketable securities-available-for-sale. These investments are diversified among high credit quality securities
in accordance with our investment policy.

Warranty

Estimated future warranty costs related to certain products are charged to operations in the period in which the related revenue is recognized.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used, including certain identifiable intangible assets, when events and
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the
carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

(q)

Cost- Method Investments

The aggregate carrying amount of our cost-method investments at June 30, 2004 were $5.3 million. At June 30, 2004, we reviewed the carrying value of these
investments and determined that the fair value of the investments exceeded the carrying values and no unrealised losses existed.

Capitalized Software Production Costs

Software development costs have been capitalized and are being amortized to the cost of product revenues over the estimated economic lives (generally
three to five years) of the products that include such software. Total net capitalized software production costs were $1.2 million and $1.6 million at June 30, 2004 and 2003 respectively.

Stock-based Employee Compensation

We have granted stock options to personnel, including officers and directors, under both our 1995 Option Plan and our 1997 Equity Participation Plan.
These options have expiration dates of ten years from the date of grant and vest over three or four years. We granted these options with the exercise price equal to the market value as determined at the date of grant.

We apply APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for our equity plans and as all
stock options are issued at market price on date of issue, no compensation cost has been recognized for the grant of stock options. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation (in thousands except per share data):

The fair value of each
stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: weighted average risk-free interest rates of 2.9%, 2.8% and 4.8% for the years ended June 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002
respectively; no dividend yield; expected option lives of 3.7 and 3.3 and 5.5 years for the years ended June 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively, and volatility of 43%, 63% and 60% for the years ended June 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104, “Revenue Recognition” (SAB No. 104), which codifies,
revises and rescinds certain sections of SAB No. 101, “Revenue Recognition”, in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and SEC rules and regulations. The changes
noted in SAB No. 104 did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial position or consolidated cash flows.

In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued statement of financial accounting standard (“SFAS”) 150,
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS 150 requires that certain financial instruments, which under previous guidance were accounted for as equity, must now be accounted for as
liabilities. The financial instruments affected include mandatory redeemable stock, certain financial instruments that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets and certain obligations that
can be settled with shares of stock. SFAS 150 is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. We
adopted SFAS 150 effective July 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operation.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which amends and clarifies
financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS 133. SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June
30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which addresses the consolidation
of certain entities (“variable interest entities”) in which an enterprise has a controlling financial interest through other than voting interests. FIN 46 requires that a variable interest entity be consolidated by the holder of the
majority of the expected risks and rewards associated with the activities of the variable interest entity. FIN 46 was effective for variable interest entities entered into prior to February 1, 2003 in periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The
adoption of FIN 46 did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46, to clarify some requirements and add new scope exceptions. The revised guidance is
effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2003. The adoption of the provisions of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) issued
EITF Issue No. 00-21 “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables”. EITF Issue No. 00-21 addresses how to determine whether a revenue arrangement involving multiple deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting
for the purposes of revenue recognition and how the revenue arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting. EITF Issue No. 00-21 applies to revenue arrangements entered into after June 15, 2003. The
adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

adjustment.

We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time
on or after June 22, 2004, but prior to June 20, 2005, at a redemption price equal to 101.6% of the principal amount of notes redeemed, and at any time after June 19, 2005, at a redemption price of 100.8% of the principal amount of notes, plus

ending on the trading day before the date of mailing of the optional redemption notice.

The notes are general unsecured obligations and are subordinated to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness and will be effectively subordinated to all of the indebtedness and liabilities of our
subsidiaries. The indenture governing the notes does not limit us or our subsidiaries from incurring senior indebtedness or other indebtedness.

Interest is to be paid on the notes on June 20 and December 20 of each year.

Stock Purchase Rights.

In April 1997, the Company implemented a plan to protect stockholders’ rights in the event of a proposed takeover of the Company. Under the plan, each share of the
Company’s outstanding common stock carries one right to purchase Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the “Right”). The Right enables the holder, under certain circumstances, to purchase common stock of the Company or of the
acquiring person at a substantially discounted price ten days after a person or group publicly announces it has acquired or has tendered an offer for 20% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock. The Rights are redeemable at $0.01 per
Right and expire in 2007.

Common
Stock.

On June 6, 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 4.0 million shares of outstanding common stock. During fiscal year 2004 and 2003, the Company repurchased 471,000 and 125,000
shares at a cost of $19.0 million and $3.5 million respectively. Shares that are repurchased are classified as treasury stock pending future use and reduce the number of shares outstanding used in calculating earnings per share.

On July 2, 2003 we acquired the assets of Respro Medical Company Limited (“Respro”), our Hong Kong distributor for total consideration of
$184,000 in cash. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, the results of operations of Respro has been included within our consolidated financial statements from July 2, 2003. An amount of $89,000, representing the
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired of $95,000, has been recorded as goodwill.

On July 24, 2002 we acquired the business of John Stark and Associates, our Texas representative, for total consideration of $0.3 million in cash. The
acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, the results of operations of John Stark and Associates were included within the Company’s consolidated financial statements from July 24, 2002. An amount of $0.3 million
representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired of $nil, has been recorded as goodwill.

Fiscal year ended June 30, 2002

Servo Magnetics, Inc. (SMI).

On May 14, 2002, the Company acquired all of the common stock of Servo Magnetics Incorporated
through a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Servo Magnetics Acquisition Inc., for total consideration, including acquisition costs, of $32.6 million. Consideration included the issue of 853,448 shares for fair value of $24.8 million with the
balance of the acquisition cost paid in cash. Upon consummation of the merger, the surviving corporation, Servo Magnetics Acquisition Inc., changed its name to Servo Magnetics, Inc.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, the results of operations of SMI have been included in
the Company’s consolidated financial statements from May 14, 2002. An amount of $30.7 million, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired of $1.9 million, has been recorded as
goodwill.

Purchased in-process research and development of
$0.4 million was expensed upon acquisition of SMI because technological feasibility of the products under development had not been established and no further alternative uses existed. The value of in-process technology was calculated by identifying
research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established, estimating the costs to develop the purchased in-process technology into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from such
products, discounting the net cash flows to present value, and applying the reduced percentage completion of the projects thereto. The discount rates used in the analysis were 19% and were based on the risk profile of the acquired assets.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and
accordingly, the results of operations of SMI have been included in our consolidated financial statements from May 14, 2002. An amount of $30.7 million, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets
acquired of $1.9 million, has been recorded as goodwill.

Legal Actions

The Company was engaged in litigation relating to the enforcement and defense of certain of its patents during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.

1995 Litigation with
Respironics.

In January 1995, our subsidiary, ResMed Limited, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California seeking monetary damages from and injunctive relief against
Respironics, Inc. for alleged infringement of three of its patents. In February 1995, Respironics filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, in Pittsburgh, against ResMed Limited seeking a declaratory
judgment that Respironics, Inc. does not infringe claims of these patents and that ResMed Limited’s patents are invalid and unenforceable.

On September 5, 2003, ResMed and Respironics settled this action. ResMed and Respironics have dismissed all claims in the action with prejudice.

2002 Litigation with
Respironics.

On October 11, 2002, ResMed Inc, ResMed Corp, and ResMed Limited filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, in San Diego against Respironics, Inc. ResMed’s suit
seeking a judgment that certain of Respironics’ mask products (Contour Deluxe, Comfort Classic, Comfort Select, and Image3 masks) infringe patents held by ResMed. The complaint further charged Respironics with copying ResMed’s proprietary
mask technology, and alleged violation of the Lanham Act, trademark and trade dress infringement, and common law violations relating to the appearance of ResMed’s mask products. ResMed sought an injunction and damages. On March 4, 2003, the
Court denied Respironics’ motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.

On October 16, 2002 Respironics, Inc. filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, in Pittsburgh, against ResMed
Limited seeking a declaratory judgment that Respironics, Inc. does not infringe the patents that are the subject of ResMed’s October 11, 2002 complaint filed in San Diego, that such patents are invalid and unenforceable and that Respironics has
not committed any other trademark, trade dress or common law violations. On July 29, 2003, the court ordered the case transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California.

On September 5, 2003, ResMed and Respironics settled both lawsuits involved
in the 2002 Litigation. ResMed and Respironics have dismissed all claims in the actions with prejudice.

Legal Actions, Continued

2002 Litigation with Fisher & Paykel Healthcare.

On August 26,
2002, ResMed Inc., ResMed Corp. and ResMed Limited filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, in San Diego against Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Inc and Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Limited (“Fisher &
Paykel Healthcare”). ResMed’s amended complaint sought a judgment that selected Fisher & Paykel Healthcare mask products infringe patents held by ResMed. The complaint further charged the defendants with the copying of ResMed
proprietary mask technology and alleges violations of the Lanham Act, trademark and trade dress infringement and common law violations relating to the appearance of ResMed mask products.

On May 6, 2003, ResMed and Fisher & Paykel Healthcare agreed to settle this patent infringement lawsuit. In accordance
with the settlement, Fisher & Paykel introduced a new design of its mask in the United States and ResMed will not assert intellectual property claims against the new mask. ResMed has dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice.

Other Litigation.

In addition to the matters
described above, in the normal course of business, we are subject to routine litigation incidental to our business. While the results of this litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that their final outcome will not have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

In-Process Research and Development Charge

MAP

On acquisition of MAP Medizin-Technologie GmbH (MAP) in February 2001, we recognized as an expense a charge of $17.7 million with respect to five
in-process research and development programs under active development by MAP at date of acquisition. The five projects were:

(i)

A single-walled nasal cushion mask system.

(ii)

A new headgear system

(iii)

A standalone active humidifier

(iv)

An autotitration CPAP device for treatment of OSA

(v)

A new OSA diagnostic screening device.

The status of each project as of June 30, 2004 is as noted below:

(i)

Single-walled nasal cushion

The nasal cushion under development by MAP on acquisition was originally due for release in October 2001. Delays in the design and manufacturing process
delayed the release for seven months, until April 2002. The delay in release of the product was not significant over its expected life cycle, and has made no significant impact on the net return assumptions used in the initial in-process research
and development model. Since release, the product (now referred to as the Papillon) has met or exceeded all sales forecasts.

In-Process Research and Development Charge, Continued

(ii)

New headgear

The new headgear product line was withheld to coincide with the release of the Papillon mask system in April 2002 and so was also seven months behind
schedule in projected release dates. Since release, the new headgear system has exceeded original sales projections and continues to meet or exceed initial expectations.

(iii)

Standalone active humidifier

Due to other priorities and to the introduction of integrated humidification flow generator devices by a number of competitors during fiscal 2002, we have
abandoned the standalone humidifier project.

Given the
relatively small revenue forecast of the product line in the in-process research and development model, the financial impact of this project is not material to ResMed or the net return of the MAP acquisition.

(iv)

Auto titration CPAP Device

The main product development effort of MAP since acquisition has been on the completion of the Autotitration CPAP flow generator specified in the initial
in-process research and development charge, now referred to as the Magellan. This project experienced some delays due to the complexity of the software algorithm development process and associated electronics resulting in the product being released
in November 2002. Sales are now broadly consistent with our initial expectations.

(v)

OSA diagnostic screening device

MAP’s new diagnostic screening device, now called the microMESAM, was released in the German market in March 2004. We remain confident in the
capacity of the device to enhance the diagnostic process, and remain confident in the potential of the product to significantly impact the treatment and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in the German market.

As at June 30, 2004, four of the five programs have been completed with the
release of the Papillon mask system, upgraded headgear, Magellan flow generator and MicroMESAM.

Given the completion of the above research programs and performance of the associated product lines, we remain confident in the assumptions used to
determine the in-process research and development charge and, as a result, the net return of the MAP acquisition.
