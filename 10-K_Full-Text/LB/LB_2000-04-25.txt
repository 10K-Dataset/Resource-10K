BUSINESS.

G

ENERAL.

The Limited, Inc., a Delaware corporation (including
   its subsidiaries, the "Company"), is principally engaged in the
   purchase, distribution and sale of women's and men's apparel, women's
   intimate apparel, and personal care products. The Company operates an
   integrated distribution system that supports its retail activities. These
   activities are conducted under various trade names primarily through the
   retail stores and catalogue businesses of the Company. Merchandise is
   targeted to appeal to customers in various market segments that have
   distinctive consumer characteristics.

General

.

As of January 29, 2000, the Company conducted its
   business in two primary segments: (1) the apparel segment, which derives its
   revenues from the sales of women's and men's apparel; and (2) Intimate
   Brands, Inc. ("IBI") (a corporation in which the Company holds an
   84.2% interest), which derives its revenues from sales of women's intimate
   and other apparel, and personal care products and accessories.

Effective August 23, 1999, the Company completed a
   tax-free spin-off to establish Limited Too as an independent public company.
   Further information regarding this transaction is contained in Note 2 of the
   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in The Limited,
   Inc., 1999 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are annexed
   hereto as Exhibit 13 (the "1999 Annual Report") and are
   incorporated herein by reference.

In addition, effective August 31, 1999, an affiliate of
   Freemen, Spogli & Co. purchased a 60% majority interest in Galyan's
   Trading Co., with the Company retaining a 40% interest. Further information
   regarding this transaction is contained in Note 1 of the Notes to the
   Consolidated Financial Statements included in The Limited, Inc., 1999 Annual
   Report to Shareholders, portions of which are annexed hereto as Exhibit 13
   (the "1999 Annual Report") and are incorporated herein by
   reference.

The following chart reflects the retail businesses and
   the number of stores in operation for each segment at January 29, 2000 and
   January 30, 1999.

*

Effective August 31, 1999, a third party purchased a
     60% majority interest in Galyan's Trading Co. and effective August 23,
     1999, the Company completed a tax-free spin-off of Limited Too.

The following table shows the changes in the number of
   retail stores operated by the Company for the past five fiscal
   years:

     and 335 stores from the August 23, 1999 spin-off of Limited Too.

The Company also owns Mast Industries, Inc., a contract
   manufacturer and apparel importer, and Gryphon Development, Inc.
   ("Gryphon"), which is a subsidiary of IBI. Gryphon creates,
   develops and contract manufactures a portion of the personal care products
   sold by the Company.

During fiscal year 1999, the Company purchased
   merchandise from approximately 2,800 suppliers

and factories located
   throughout the world. In addition to purchases through Mast and Gryphon, the
   Company purchases merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the
   domestic market, some of which is manufactured overseas. The Company's
   business is subject to a variety of risks generally associated with doing
   business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as
   political instability, currency and exchange risks, and local business
   practice and political issues. The Company has established formal policies
   and procedures designed to address such risks; however, they remain beyond
   the Company's control. No more than 5% of goods purchased originated from
   any single manufacturer.

Most of the merchandise and related materials for the
   Company's stores is shipped to the Company's distribution centers in the
   Columbus, Ohio area. The Company uses common and contract carriers to
   distribute merchandise and related materials to its stores. The Company's
   businesses generally have independent distribution capabilities and no
   business receives priority over any other business.

The Company's policy is to maintain sufficient
   quantities of inventory on hand in its retail stores and distribution
   centers so that it can offer customers an appropriate selection of current
   merchandise. The Company emphasizes rapid turnover and takes markdowns as
   required to keep merchandise fresh and current with fashion
   trends.

The Company views the retail apparel market as having
   two principal selling seasons, spring and fall. As is generally the case in
   the retail apparel industry, the Company experiences its peak sales activity
   during the fall season. This seasonal sales pattern results in increased
   inventory during the fall and Christmas holiday selling periods. During
   fiscal year 1999, the highest inventory level was $1.5 billion at November
   1999 month-end and the lowest inventory level was $1.1 billion at the
   January 2000 month-end.

Merchandise sales are paid for with cash, by personal
   check, and with credit cards issued by third parties or by the Company's
   31%-owned credit card processing venture, Alliance Data Systems.

The Company offers its customers a return policy stated
   as "No Sale is Ever Final." The Company believes that certain of
   its competitors offer similar service policies.

The following is a brief description of each of the
   Company's operating businesses, including their respective target
   markets.

   reference. For the financial results of the Company's reportable operating
   segments, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
   included in the 1999 Annual Report, incorporated herein by
   reference.

C

OMPETITION.

The sale of intimate and other apparel and personal
   care products through retail stores is a highly competitive business with
   numerous competitors, including individual and chain fashion specialty
   stores, department stores and discount retailers. Brand image, marketing,
   fashion design, price, service, fashion selection and quality are the
   principal competitive factors in retail store sales. The Company's catalogue
   business competes with numerous national and regional catalogue
   merchandisers. Brand image, marketing, fashion design, price, service,
   quality, image presentation and fulfillment are the principal competitive
   factors in catalogue and on-line sales.

The Company is unable to estimate the number of
   competitors or its relative competitive position due to the large number of
   companies selling apparel and personal care products at retail through
   stores, catalogues and the Internet.

A

SSOCIATE

R

ELATIONS.

On January 29, 2000, the Company employed approximately
   114,600 associates, 82,500 of whom were part-time. In addition, temporary
   associates are hired during peak periods, such as the Holiday
   season.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

The Company's business is principally conducted from
   office, distribution and shipping facilities located in the Columbus, Ohio
   area. Additional facilities are located in New York City, New York; Andover,
   Massachusetts; Kettering, Ohio; Rio Rancho, New Mexico and London,
   England.

The distribution and shipping facilities owned by the
   Company consist of eight buildings located in the Columbus, Ohio area.
   Excluding office space, these buildings comprise approximately 6.1 million
   square feet.

Substantially all of the retail stores operated by the
   Company are located in leased facilities, primarily in shopping centers
   throughout the continental United States. The leases expire at various dates
   between 2000 and 2028 and frequently have renewal options.

Typically, when space is leased for a retail store in a
   shopping center, all improvements, including interior walls, floors,
   ceilings, fixtures and decorations, are supplied by the tenant. In certain
   cases, the landlord of the property may provide a construction allowance to
   fund all or a portion of the cost of improvements. The cost of improvements
   varies widely, depending on the size and location of the store. Rental terms
   for new locations usually include a fixed minimum rent plus a percentage of
   sales in excess of a specified amount. Certain operating costs such as
   common area maintenance, utilities, insurance and taxes are typically paid
   by tenants.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

The Company is a defendant in a variety of lawsuits
   arising in the ordinary course of business.

On November 13, 1997, the United States District Court
   for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, dismissed with
   prejudice an amended complaint that had been filed against the Company and
   certain of its subsidiaries by the American Textile Manufacturers Institute
   ("ATMI"), a textile industry trade association. The amended
   complaint alleged that the defendants violated the federal False Claims Act
   by submitting false country of origin declarations to the U.S. Customs
   Service. On September 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the
   Sixth Circuit affirmed the order of dismissal. The United States Supreme
   Court denied ATMI's petition for writ of certiorari on April 3,
   2000.

On January 13, 1999, two complaints were filed against
   the Company and its subsidiary, Lane Bryant, Inc., as well as other
   defendants, including many national retailers. Both complaints relate to
   labor practices allegedly employed on the island of Saipan, Commonwealth of
   the Northern Mariana Islands, by apparel manufacturers unrelated to the
   Company (some of which have sold goods to the Company) and seek injunctions,
   unspecified monetary damages, and other relief. One complaint, on behalf of
   a class of unnamed garment workers, filed in the United States District
   Court for the Central District of California, Western Division, alleges
   violations of federal statutes, the United States Constitution, and
   international law. On April 12, 1999, a motion to dismiss that complaint for
   failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted was filed, and it
   remains pending. On September 29, 1999, the United States District Court for
   the Central District of California, Western Division, transferred the case
   to the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii. The Company,
   along with certain other defendants, filed a petition for a writ of mandamus
   from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals seeking an order holding that the
   transfer of the case to the United States District Court for the District of
   Hawaii was in error and ordering that the case be transferred to the United
   States District Court on Saipan. That petition has been denied. The second
   complaint, filed by a national labor union and other organizations in the
   Superior Court of the State of California, San Francisco County, and which
   alleges unfair business practices under California law, remains
   pending.

In May and June 1999, purported shareholders of the
   Company filed three derivative actions in the Court of Chancery of the State
   of Delaware, naming as defendants the members of the Company's board of
   directors and the Company, as nominal defendant. The actions thereafter were
   consolidated. The operative complaint generally alleged that the rescission
   of the Contingent Stock Redemption Agreement previously entered into by the
   Company with Leslie H. Wexner and The Wexner Children's Trust (the
   "Contingent Stock Redemption Agreement") constituted a waste of
   corporate assets and a breach of the board members' fiduciary duties, and
   that the issuer tender offer completed on June 3, 1999 was a "wasteful
   transaction in its own right." On July 30, 1999, all defendants moved
   to dismiss the complaint, both on the ground that it failed to allege facts
   showing that demand on the board to institute such an action would be futile
   and for failure to state a claim. Plaintiffs did not respond to that motion,
   but on February 16, 2000, plaintiffs filed a first amended consolidated
   derivative complaint (the "amended complaint"), which makes
   allegations similar to the first complaint concerning the rescission of the
   Contingent Stock Redemption Agreement and the 1999 issuer tender offer and
   adds allegations apparently intended to show that certain directors were not
   disinterested in those decisions. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended
   complaint on April 14, 2000.

Although it is not possible to predict with certainty
   the eventual outcome of any litigation, in the opinion of management, the
   foregoing proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on
   the Company's financial position or results of operations.
