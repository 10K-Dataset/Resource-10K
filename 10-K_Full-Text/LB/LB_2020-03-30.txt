PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

General

L Brands, Inc. (“we” or the "Company”) operates in the highly competitive specialty retail business. Founded in 1963 in Columbus, Ohio, we have evolved from an apparel-based specialty retailer to a segment leader focused on women’s intimate and other apparel, personal care, beauty and home fragrance products. We sell our merchandise through company-owned specialty retail stores in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada, the United Kingdom ("U.K."), Ireland and Greater China (China and Hong Kong); through websites; and through international franchise, license and wholesale partners (collectively, "partners").

On February 20, 2020, we and SP VS Buyer LP ("Sycamore"), an affiliate of Sycamore Partners Management, L.P., entered into a Transaction Agreement (the "Transaction Agreement'') pursuant to which, among other things, we will transfer certain assets and liabilities relating to our business conducted under the Victoria's Secret and PINK brands to our newly formed subsidiary ("Victoria's Secret Holdco") and sell 55% of the equity interests of Victoria's Secret Holdco to Sycamore.   After taking into account certain liabilities, Sycamore will purchase the 55% interest in Victoria's Secret Holdco. for approximately

$525 million

. We will retain a 45% interest in Victoria’s Secret to enable our shareholders to participate in the upside potential of the business.  We intend to use the proceeds from the transaction, along with approximately $500 million of excess balance sheet cash, to reduce debt.  For additional information, see "Recent Developments" below.  For additional information regarding the risks and other uncertainties and factors related to the transaction, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Real Estate

Company-owned Retail Stores

Our company-owned retail stores are located in shopping malls, lifestyle centers and street locations in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Ireland and Greater China. As a result of our strong brands and established retail presence, we have been able to lease high-traffic locations in most retail centers in which we operate.

Franchise, License and Wholesale Arrangements

In addition to our company-owned stores, our products are sold at hundreds of partner locations in more than 70 countries. Under these arrangements, third parties operate stores that sell our products under our brand names. Revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers. Revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner. We continue to increase the number of locations under these types of arrangements as part of our international expansion.

Our Strengths

We believe the following competitive strengths contribute to our leading market position, differentiate us from our competitors and will drive future growth:

Industry Leading Brands

We have developed and operate brands that allow us to target markets across the economic spectrum, across demographics and across the world. We believe that our three brands, Victoria's Secret, PINK and Bath & Body Works, are highly recognizable, which provides us with a competitive advantage.

•

At Victoria’s Secret, we market glamorous and sexy product lines to our customers. While bras and panties are the core of what we do, this brand also gives our customers choices in beauty products, fragrances, sleepwear, loungewear, athletic attire and personal care accessories.

•

At PINK, we market products to the college-aged woman. While bras and panties are the core of what we do, this brand also gives our customers choices in apparel, loungewear, athletic attire and accessories.

•

Bath & Body Works caters to our customers’ entire well-being, providing shower gels and lotions, aromatherapy, home fragrance, soaps and sanitizers and body care accessories.

In-Store Experience and Store Operations

We view our customers' in-store experience as an important vehicle for communicating the image of each brand. We utilize visual presentation of merchandise, in-store marketing, music and our sales associates to reinforce the image represented by the brands.

Our in-store marketing is designed to convey the principal elements and personality of each brand. The store design, furniture, fixtures and music are all carefully planned and coordinated to create a unique shopping experience. Every brand displays merchandise uniformly to ensure a consistent store experience, regardless of location. Store managers receive detailed plans designating fixture and merchandise placement to ensure coordinated execution of the company-wide merchandising strategy.

Our sales associates and managers are a central element in creating the atmosphere of the stores by providing a high level of customer service.

Digital Experience

In addition to our in-store experience, we strive to create a customer-centric digital platform that integrates the digital and physical brand experience.  Our digital presence, including social media, our websites and our mobile applications, allows us to get to know our customers better and communicate with them anytime and anywhere.

Product Development, Sourcing and Logistics

We believe a large part of our success comes from frequent and innovative product launches, which include bra launches at Victoria’s Secret and PINK and new fragrance and other product launches at Bath & Body Works. Our merchant, design and sourcing teams have a long history of bringing innovative products to our customers. Additionally, we believe that our sourcing and production function (Mast Global) has a long and deep presence in the key sourcing markets including those in the U.S. and Asia, which helps us partner with the best manufacturers to get high-quality products quickly.

Experienced and Committed Management Team

We were founded in 1963 and have been led since inception by Leslie H. Wexner. Our senior management team has a wealth of retail and business experience at L Brands, Inc. and other companies such as The Gap, Ralph Lauren, Tory Burch, Starbucks, Land's End, Levi Strauss, Boots, The Home Depot and Yum Brands. We believe that we have one of the most experienced management teams in retail.

Upon closing of the transaction contemplated by the Transaction Agreement (the "Closing"), Mr. Wexner will step down as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board to become Chairman Emeritus, remaining as a member of the Board.  Andrew Meslow, Chief Executive Officer of Bath & Body Works, will be appointed by the Board as the Chief Executive Officer of L Brands, Inc. and as a director of L Brands, Inc., effective upon the Closing.  Mr. Meslow, who joined L Brands, Inc. in 2003, has 29 years of experience in the retail industry, including the last 15 at Bath & Body Works.  Additionally, Sarah E. Nash, a member of the Board, will be appointed as the Chair of the Board effective upon the Closing.



Additional Information

Merchandise Vendors

During


, we purchased merchandise from approximately


vendors located throughout the world. No vendor provided

10%

or more of our merchandise purchases.

Distribution and Merchandise Inventory

Most of our merchandise is shipped to our distribution centers in the Columbus, Ohio, area. We use a variety of shipping terms that result in the transfer of title of the merchandise at either the point of origin or point of destination.

Our policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventories on hand in our retail stores and distribution centers to enable us to offer customers an appropriate selection of current merchandise. We emphasize rapid turnover and take markdowns as required to keep merchandise fresh and current.

Information Systems

Our management information systems consist of a full range of retail, financial and merchandising systems. The systems include applications related to point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management, data security and support systems including human resources and finance.

Seasonal Business

Our operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: Spring (the first and second quarters) and Fall (the third and fourth quarters). The fourth quarter, including the holiday season, accounted for approximately one-third of our net sales for


,


and


and is typically our most profitable quarter. Accordingly, cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as our inventories build in advance of the holiday season.

Working Capital

We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs and investment opportunities.

Regulation

We and our products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities. We are subject to a variety of tax and customs regulations and international trade arrangements.

Trademarks and Patents

Our trademarks and patents, which constitute our primary intellectual property, have been registered or are the subject of pending applications in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law. We believe our products are identified by our intellectual property and, thus, our intellectual property is of significant value. Accordingly, we intend to maintain our intellectual property and related registrations and vigorously protect our intellectual property assets against infringement.

Segment Information

We have three reportable segments: Victoria’s Secret, Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International. For additional information, including the financial results of our reportable segments, see Note


to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item


. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Other Information

For additional information about our business, including our net sales and profits for the last three years and selling square footage, see Item


. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Competition

The sale of women's intimate and other apparel, home fragrance, personal care and beauty products and accessories through retail stores is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. Brand image, marketing, design, price, service, assortment and quality are the principal competitive factors in retail store sales. Our online businesses compete with numerous online merchandisers. Image presentation, fulfillment and the factors affecting retail store sales discussed above are the principal competitive factors in online sales.



Associate Relations

As of

February 1, 2020

, we employed approximately

94,400

associates;

68,900

of whom were part-time. In addition, temporary associates are hired during peak periods, such as the holiday season.

Recent Developments

Victoria’s Secret Transaction

On February 20, 2020, we and Sycamore entered into a definitive agreement that is intended to deliver long-term value to L Brands, Inc. shareholders by positioning Bath & Body Works as a standalone public company and transitioning Victoria's Secret, including business conducted under the Victoria's Secret and PINK brands and certain support functions, into a privately-held entity.

After taking into account certain liabilities, Sycamore will purchase a 55% interest in Victoria's Secret for approximately

$525 million

. We will retain a 45% interest in Victoria’s Secret to enable our shareholders to participate in the upside potential of the business.  The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to customary closing conditions.  We will report the results of Victoria's Secret as discontinued operations beginning in the first quarter of 2020.

Upon the Closing, Leslie H. Wexner will step down as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board to become Chairman Emeritus, remaining as a member of the Board.  Andrew Meslow, Chief Executive Officer of Bath & Body Works, will be appointed by the Board as the Chief Executive Officer of L Brands, Inc. and as director of L Brands, Inc., effective upon the Closing. Sarah E. Nash, a member of the Board, will be appointed as the Chair of the Board effective upon the Closing.

Company Response to Coronavirus

We are closely monitoring the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan, China and has since spread globally. The coronavirus has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a “pandemic,” has spread to many countries, including the U.S., and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A public health epidemic, including the coronavirus, poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an unknown period of time. Related industries in the U.S. and across the world may be adversely affected, including manufacturing and textile production. The situation and preventative or protective actions that governments around the world have taken to contain the spread of the coronavirus have resulted in a period of disruption, including closure of stores where our products are sold, limited store operating hours, reduced customer traffic and consumer spending, labor shortages and delays in manufacturing and shipping of products and raw materials in the U.S., China and other countries. To the extent the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, we may have difficulty obtaining the materials necessary for the manufacturing of our products, factories which produce our products may remain closed for sustained periods of time, and industry-wide shipment of products may be negatively impacted. Further, if the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, consumer behavior may be altered for an extended period of time which would impact our cash and liquidity and financial condition.  The coronavirus and resulting economic disruption has also led to significant volatility in the capital markets and may adversely impact our stock price and ability to access cash.  Any one adverse effect of the coronavirus, or a combination of adverse effects, could materially impact our results and financial condition.

Subsequent to

February 1, 2020

, we announced actions in response to the continued spread of the coronavirus.



On March 16, 2020, in an abundance of caution and as a proactive measure, we elected to borrow

$950 million

from our secured revolving credit facility ("Secured Revolving Facility"), leaving our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility at

$22 million

.

On March 17, 2020, we announced the temporary closure of all Bath & Body Works, Victoria’s Secret and PINK stores in the United States and Canada through March 29, 2020. Associates will continue to receive pay and benefits through April 4, 2020, which is one week longer than originally announced.

Based on the continued spread of the coronavirus and stay-at-home orders by government officials across the country, we are extending the closure of our stores beyond the initial March 29th date. As the situation continues to evolve rapidly, we are not currently able to predict the timing of store reopenings. However, we are monitoring the situation closely and will provide updates as appropriate. We continue to serve customers through our direct channels.

In an effort to further strengthen our financial flexibility and efficiently manage through the pandemic, we are proactively taking the following additional actions:

•

Suspending our quarterly cash dividend beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. We remain committed to paying dividends over the long-term and will re-evaluate when appropriate.

•

Executing a substantial reduction in expenses and capital expenditures.  This includes an ongoing reduction in forward inventory receipts.

•

Temporarily reducing base compensation by 20% for senior vice presidents and above.  The cash compensation of Chairman and CEO Leslie H. Wexner and other members of the Board of Directors has been suspended. Additionally, we are deferring annual merit increases.

•

Furloughing most store associates and those who are not currently working to support the online businesses or who cannot work from home, effective April 5, 2020 until further notice. All furloughed associates will continue to receive existing healthcare benefits. As circumstances change, we will make every effort to bring these associates back to work as soon as possible. Furloughed associates will also be able to apply for unemployment benefits, if eligible.

As of March 27, 2020, we currently have more than $2 billion in cash, which includes the

$950 million

borrowed under the Secured Revolving Facility on March 16, 2020.  Our Secured Revolving Facility has certain financial covenants, including a debt to consolidated EBITDA covenant, which may be breached as early as the end of the fiscal quarter ending May 2, 2020. If we were to violate a covenant, our lenders would have the right to accelerate our Secured Revolving Facility indebtedness, demand cash collateral in respect of the letters of credit issued thereunder and terminate the funding commitments available thereunder.  While we believe that we would be able to obtain temporary waivers for any such breach of a covenant to prevent an acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness or obtain a replacement credit facility, we cannot conclude with certainty that we would have the ability to obtain necessary waivers or negotiate less restrictive debt covenants with our lenders.  We are in active conversations with the lenders under our credit facility to obtain a replacement credit facility that does not contain a debt to consolidated EBITDA financial covenant or a temporary waiver in respect of such financial covenant in our existing Secured Revolving Facility.  We believe that our current cash balance, along with the actions taken as outlined above, provides us with sufficient current liquidity.

These recent developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Additional information on this risk and other uncertainties and factors, is set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

The following discussion of risk factors contains “forward-looking statements.” These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K, other filings or in any other discussions of our business. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item


. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and Item


. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described below are not our only risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition in a material way.

Our net sales, profit results and cash flows are sensitive to, and may be affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence, spending patterns, weather, significant health hazards or pandemics or other market disruptions.

Our net sales, profit, cash flows and future growth may be affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. In addition, market disruptions due to natural disasters, significant health hazards or pandemics, or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels. Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located, particularly in markets where we have multiple stores, could adversely affect our business. Purchases of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. In such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We are closely monitoring the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan, China and has since spread globally. The coronavirus has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a “pandemic,” has spread to many countries, including the U.S., and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A public health epidemic, including the coronavirus, poses the risk that the we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an unknown period of time. Related industries in the U.S. and across the world may be adversely effected, including manufacturing and textile production. The situation and preventative or protective actions that governments around the world have taken to contain the spread of the coronavirus have resulted in a period of disruption, including closure of stores where our products are sold, limited store operating hours, reduced customer traffic and



consumer spending, labor shortages or the extended furlough of our employees and delays in manufacturing and shipping of products and raw materials in the U.S., China and other countries. To the extent the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, we may have difficulty obtaining the materials necessary for the manufacturing of our products, factories which produce our products may remain closed for sustained periods of time, and industry-wide shipment of products may be negatively impacted. Further, if the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, consumer behavior may be altered for an extended period of time which would impact our cash and liquidity and financial condition.  The coronavirus and resulting economic disruption has also led to significant volatility in the capital markets and may adversely impact our stock price and ability to access cash.  Any one adverse effect of the coronavirus, or a combination of adverse effects, could materially impact our results and financial condition.  Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to this risk, and other uncertainties and factors.

Recently, the decision by the U.K. to leave the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) has increased the uncertainty in the economic and political environment in Europe.  Ongoing uncertainty remains as to what kind of post-Brexit agreement between the U.K. and the European Union, if any, may be approved by the U.K. parliament. Our business in the U.K. may be adversely impacted by this uncertainty, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, changes in trade policies, or changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws.

Our net sales, operating income, cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis.

We experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season. Any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels, since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. We must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. If we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We have entered into an agreement pursuant to which we will transfer certain assets and liabilities relating to our business conducted under the Victoria’s Secret and PINK brands (the “Victoria’s Secret Business”) to a newly formed subsidiary (“Victoria’s Secret Holdco”) and sell 55% of the equity interests of Victoria’s Secret Holdco to an affiliate of Sycamore Partners Management, L.P. (“Sycamore”). The proposed VS Transaction involves risks, including risks that the proposed transaction may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline, or at all, and may not achieve the intended benefits.

The VS Transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to customary closing conditions, including; (1) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (2) the receipt of approval under the Competition Act of Canada, (3) the absence of any applicable law, injunction or other judgment that prohibits the closing, and (iv) the completion of certain restructuring transactions. In addition, each of our and Sycamore’s obligation to complete the VS Transaction is subject to, among other things, the accuracy of the other party’s representations and warranties in the Transaction Agreement (subject in most cases to “material” and “material adverse effect” qualifications), and the other party’s compliance with its covenants and agreements in the Transaction Agreement in all material respects. The Transaction Agreement provides that we or Sycamore may choose not to proceed with the VS Transaction if the VS Transaction has not been completed by August 20, 2020, which date may be extended by either party to November 20, 2020 under certain circumstances where the restructuring transactions have not been completed pending governmental approvals.

The satisfaction of the required conditions could delay the consummation of the proposed transaction with Sycamore or prevent it from occurring. Further, there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the proposed transaction will be satisfied or waived or that the proposed transaction will be consummated. With respect to regulatory approvals, there can be no assurance that the required regulatory approvals will be received in a timely manner or at all, or that such approvals will not contain adverse conditions. Failure to consummate the proposed transaction in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market price of our common stock, as well as our future business and its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Assuming the VS Transaction is completed, there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the anticipated value and benefits therefrom, and the VS Transaction may adversely affect our business. The proposed transaction will result in a smaller, less diversified and more narrowly focused business than before the VS Transaction, which makes us more vulnerable to changing market and economic conditions. Additionally, a potential loss of synergies from separating the businesses could negatively impact our balance sheet, profit margins or earnings, and the price of our common stock may not be equal to or



greater than the value of our common stock had the VS Transaction not occurred. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the VS Transaction, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

We will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the VS Transaction is pending.

Uncertainty about the effect of the VS Transaction on employees, commercial partners and vendors may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause commercial partners, vendors and others that deal with us to defer or decline entering into contracts with us or seek to change existing business relationships with us. Certain of our contracts contain restrictions that may give rise to a right of termination or cancellation in connection with the VS Transaction. In addition, if key employees depart because of uncertainty about their future roles and the potential complexities of the VS Transaction, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, the Transaction Agreement contains restrictions on our ability take certain actions relating to the Victoria’s Secret Business outside the ordinary course of business prior to the closing, which may delay or prevent us from undertaking certain actions or business opportunities that may arise prior to the closing.

Turnover in company leadership or other key positions may have an adverse impact on company performance.

Upon the consummation of the VS Transaction, our current Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") will step down and a new CEO will be appointed. Leslie H. Wexner will step down from his position as our CEO and Chairman of the Board after leading the company for more than five decades. Mr. Wexner will remain a member of the Board as Chairman Emeritus. Andrew Meslow, the current Chief Executive Officer of Bath & Body Works, will become our new CEO and will be appointed as a member of the Board.  Sarah E. Nash, a member of the Board, will be appointed as the Chair of the Board, effective upon Closing. Additionally, current lead independent director Allan Tessler, as well as directors Gordon Gee and Raymond Zimmerman, will retire as of the date of the annual meeting, and upon Mr. Tessler's retirement, Ms. Nash will serve as lead independent director.  Such leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage, and an inadequate transition of our CEO may cause disruption to our business, including to our relationships with vendors and employees.

We may well experience further changes in key leadership or key positions in the future. The departure of key leadership personnel, especially a long-serving CEO, can take from the company significant knowledge and experience. This loss of knowledge and experience can be mitigated through successful hiring and transition, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts. Attracting and retaining qualified senior leadership may be more challenging under adverse business conditions. Failure to attract and retain the right talent, or to smoothly manage the transition of responsibilities resulting from such turnover, would affect our ability to meet our challenges and may cause us to miss performance objectives or financial targets or disrupt our relationships with our customers.

We may be impacted by our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified associates and manage labor-related costs.

We believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive, engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged associates. Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified associates, including store personnel and talented merchants. The turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high, and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. Competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs. Our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand. Delayed store openings, significant increases in associate turnover rates or significant increases in labor-related costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Retained or contingent liabilities from businesses that we divest could adversely affect our financial results. Our continued involvement with Victoria’s Secret Holdco is also subject to various arrangements, and conditions outside of our control could affect our future results.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of La Senza to an affiliate of Regent LP, a global private equity firm, and in the first quarter of 2020, we signed a Transaction Agreement with Sycamore to effect the VS Transaction. As a result of the La Senza divestiture and upon the consummation of the VS Transaction, we may incur unexpected contingent liabilities, including with respect to leases assumed by the buyer. Our divestiture activities may also present financial and operational risks. Those risks may include difficulties separating personnel, financial and other systems, and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyer of La Senza and/or Victoria’s Secret Holdco. Any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we will continue to have financial involvement with Victoria’s Secret Holdco after the closing, including through our 45% interest in Victoria’s Secret Holdco, transition services agreements and guarantees.



Under these arrangements, performance by Victoria’s Secret Holdco or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future results.

Our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space.

Most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers. Sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic in those retail areas. Our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area, including “destination” retail stores, to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. Sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by factors that we cannot control, such as economic downturns or changes in consumer demographics in a particular area, consumer trends away from brick-and-mortar retail toward online shopping, competition from internet and other retailers and other retail areas where we do not have stores, significant health hazards or pandemics, the closing of other stores or the decline in popularity or safety in the shopping areas where our stores are located and the deterioration in the financial condition of the operators or developers of the shopping areas in which our stores are located.

Part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. We cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. Some of our store locations require significant upfront capital investment and have material lease commitments. Additionally, we are dependent upon the suitability of the lease spaces that we currently use. The leases that we enter into are generally noncancelable leases with initial terms of 10 years. If we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a store and decide to close it, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term.

These risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions.

Our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis. Accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations. There can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our plans for international expansion include risks that could impact our results and reputation.

We intend to further expand into international markets, including mainland China, through partner arrangements and/or company-owned stores. The risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. Any of these difficulties may lead to disruption in the overall timing of our international expansion efforts or increased costs.  Further, entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence. Other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, volatility in the geopolitical landscape, restrictions on the repatriation of funds held internationally, disruptions or delays in shipments, occurrence of significant health hazards or pandemics, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, political instability and foreign governmental regulation.  For example, in December 2019, a strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, resulting in temporary store closures and a decrease in consumer traffic in China.  To date, this virus has begun to spread globally.  We expect the coronavirus to negatively impact our results of operations, particularly in the Greater China business, and our plans for expansion in China, though the extent and duration of this impact remain uncertain.  To the extent the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, we may have difficulty obtaining the materials necessary for the manufacturing of our products, factories which produce our products may remain closed for sustained periods of time and industry-wide shipment of products may be negatively impacts.  Such expansions will also have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance.

We also have risks related to identifying suitable partners. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales and their compliance with federal and local law. We cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets.



Further, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. See “Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations” below.

These risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our licensees, franchisees and wholesalers could take actions that could harm our business or brand images.

We have global representation through independently owned stores operated by our partners. Although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners, the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited, and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. For example, our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. Our brand image and reputation may suffer materially, and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully. These risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our direct channel businesses include risks that could have an effect on our results.

Our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results. Risks include, but are not limited to, the difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through our direct channels; domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it outside our control; our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs; the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our web infrastructure, websites and the related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.

Our failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted order-taking and fulfillment operations could also have a material adverse effect on our results. The satisfaction of our online customers depends on their timely receipt of merchandise. If we encounter difficulties with the distribution facilities, or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason, including as a result of fire, natural disaster or work stoppage, we could face shortages of inventory; incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers; and cause customer dissatisfaction.

Any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our ability to protect our reputation could have a material effect on our brand images.

Our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images. Our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. Any negative publicity, including information publicized through traditional or social media platforms and similar venues such as blogs, websites and other forums, may affect our reputation and brand and, consequently, reduce demand for our merchandise, even if such publicity is unverified or inaccurate.

Failure to comply with or the perception that the Company has failed to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls, to maintain the security of customer, associate, third-party or company information or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.

If our marketing, advertising and promotional programs are unsuccessful, or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are, our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected.

Customer traffic and demand for our merchandise are influenced by our advertising, marketing and promotional activities, the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of and service offered in our stores. Although we use marketing, advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media, including social media, websites, mobile applications, email, print and television, some of our competitors may expend more for their programs than we do, or use different approaches than we do, which may provide them with a competitive advantage. Our programs may not be effective or could require increased expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.



Our ability to adequately protect our trade names, trademarks and patents could have an impact on our brand images and ability to penetrate new markets.

We believe that our trade names, trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy. We have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names, trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries. There can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. In particular, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If any third-party copies our products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, it could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our ability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could impact our results.

The sale of women’s intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. We compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. In addition to the traditional store-based retailers, we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through online channels. Brand image, marketing, design, price, service, assortment, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and online channels.

Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available and trends across our product categories may favor our competitors. We rely to a greater degree than some of our competitors on physical locations in shopping malls and centers and so declines in traffic to such locations may affect us more significantly than our competitors. Some of our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls and centers as our stores. In addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls and centers.

Increased competition, combined with declines in mall traffic, could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of pricing power and market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our ability to manage the life cycle of our brands and to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could impact the image and relevance of our brands.

Our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively manage the life cycle of our brands and to anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, salable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. Customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly. If we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales will be lower, potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. In response, we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We may be impacted by our ability to adequately source, distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis.

We source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market. We distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores. Many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or safeguard quotas. We compete with other companies for production facilities.

We also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis. For example:

•

political instability, environmental hazards or natural disasters which could negatively affect international economies, financial markets and business activity;

•

significant health hazards or pandemics, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials, and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;

•

imposition of new or retaliatory trade duties, sanctions or taxes and other charges on imports or exports;

•

evolving, new or complex legal and regulatory matters;

•

volatility in currency exchange rates;



•

local business practice and political issues (including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards) which may result in adverse publicity or threatened or actual adverse consumer actions, including boycotts;

•

potential delays or disruptions in shipping and transportation and related pricing impacts;

•

disruption due to labor disputes; and

•

changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation or other factors.

We also rely upon third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments, including shipments to and from our distribution centers, to our stores and to our customers. Our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in labor costs and fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, and associate strikes and inclement weather, which may impact our transportation providers’ ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs.

For example, the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China has led to work and travel restrictions within, to, and out of mainland China, which in turn has led to delays in textile mill and factory openings, and delays in workers returning, following the Chinese New Year holiday. To date, this virus has begun to spread globally, and various governments have either enforced further restrictions or have begun pondering taking action soon. These restrictions and delays, which may further expand depending on the progression of the illness, may make it difficult for our suppliers to source raw materials in China, manufacture finished goods in China and export our products from China.  Additionally, our suppliers throughout Asia source a significant amount of fabric from China. If the severity and reach of the coronavirus outbreak increases, there may be significant and material disruptions to our supply chain and operations, and delays in the manufacture and shipment of our products, which may then have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above, which are beyond our control, and the occurrence or deepening impact of one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We rely on a number of vendor and distribution facilities located in the same vicinity, making our business susceptible to local and regional disruptions or adverse conditions.

To achieve the necessary speed and agility in producing our beauty, personal care and home fragrance products, we rely heavily on vendor and distribution facilities in close proximity to our headquarters in Central Ohio. As a result of geographic concentration of the vendor and distribution facilities that we rely upon, our operations are susceptible to local and regional factors, such as accidents, system failures, economic and weather conditions, natural disasters, demographic and population changes, and other unforeseen events and circumstances. Any significant interruption in the operations of these facilities could lead to inventory issues or increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations.

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, our royalty arrangements are calculated based on sales in local currency and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Although we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the short-term negative impacts of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations. Hedging would generally not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign exchange rates on our business results. As a result, the fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our stock price may be volatile.

Our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry. Any guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe are reasonably attainable at the time guidance is given. If, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts or others, our stock price could be adversely affected. Investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk.

In addition, the stock market may experience price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance.



On March 27, 2020, our Board of Directors announced that it planned to suspend our annual ordinary dividend, beginning with the quarterly dividend to be paid in our second fiscal quarter in 2020. There can be no assurance if, when and at what level our Board of Directors may resume making dividend payments.

On March 27, 2020, our Board of Directors announced that it planned to suspend our annual ordinary dividend, beginning with the quarterly dividend to be paid in our second fiscal quarter in 2020. While we remain committed to paying dividends over the long-term and will re-evaluate when appropriate, there can be no assurance if, when and at what level our Board of Directors may resume making dividend payments. Our dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability is subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our failure to pay dividends may negatively impact our stock price.

Our ability to maintain our credit rating could affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense.

The credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. A deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating. Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations. We are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. If our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest costs will likely increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, changes to our credit rating could affect our future interest costs.

If we breach covenants in  our Secured Revolving Facility, our ability to service or refinance our debt as well as our financial stability may be impacted.

We currently have substantial indebtedness. Our Secured Revolving Facility contains covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also, under certain conditions, restrict our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in the agreement. Our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments. If our cash flow from operations declines, we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt, or make certain restricted payments as defined in our Secured Revolving Facility. If we fail to comply with any covenant, including our financial maintenance covenants, it could result in an event of default and our lenders could terminate the commitments under our Secured Revolving Facility as well as certain foreign borrowing facilities and make the entire debt incurred thereunder immediately due and payable or we may be forced to sell assets, restructure our indebtedness or seek additional equity capital, which would dilute our stockholders’ interests. In particular, as of March 27, 2020, we currently have more than $2 billion in cash, which includes the $950 million borrowed under the Secured Revolving Facility on March 16, 2020. However, our Secured Revolving Facility has certain financial covenants, including a debt to consolidated EBITDA covenant, which may be breached as early as the end of the fiscal quarter ending May 2, 2020. We are in active conversations with our lenders regarding a temporary waiver in respect of such financial covenant or the possibility of entering into a replacement credit facility without a similar covenant. If we are unable to obtain a temporary waiver for that anticipated covenant breach or to obtain a replacement credit facility without a similar covenant, our lenders would have the right to accelerate our Secured Revolving Facility indebtedness, demand cash collateral in respect of the letters of credit issued thereunder and terminate the funding commitments available thereunder. If this occurs, we might not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.

Shareholder activism could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy and impact our stock price.

Shareholder activism, which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could result in substantial costs and divert management’s and our board’s attention and resources from our business.  Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with our associates, customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel.  Also, we may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters, including for third-party advisors.  Our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism.

We may be impacted by our vendors’ ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner, meet quality standards and comply with applicable laws and regulations.

We purchase products from third-party vendors. Factors outside our control, such as production or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns.



In addition, quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability, competition reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image.

Our business could also suffer if our third-party vendors fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations. While our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our associates visit and monitor the operations of our third-party vendors, we do not control these vendors or their practices. The violation of labor, environmental or other laws by third-party vendors used by us, or the divergence of a third-party vendor’s or partner’s labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation.

These risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our results may be affected by fluctuations in product input costs.

Product input costs, including freight, labor and raw materials, fluctuate. These fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs. We may not be able to, or may elect not to, pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our ability to adequately protect our assets from loss and theft.

Our assets are subject to loss, including those caused by illegal or unethical conduct by associates, customers, vendors or unaffiliated third parties. We have experienced events such as inventory shrinkage in the past, and we cannot assure that incidences of loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce these losses. Higher rates of loss or increased security costs to combat theft could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our results may be affected by fluctuations in energy costs.

Energy costs have fluctuated in the past. These fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers. A continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We may be impacted by increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing.

Postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and promotional mailings. We rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. Future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We self-insure certain risks and may be impacted by unfavorable claims experience.

We are self-insured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits, workers’ compensation, property, general liability and automobile up to certain stop-loss limits. Claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile. Any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data.

Our success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. Our information technology systems, as well as those of our service providers, are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite maintaining comprehensive measures, some of our systems, e-commerce environments, servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Additionally, these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer, merchandise, financial, employee or other important information (including personal information) which could result in damage to our reputation and/or litigation. The increased use of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices may also heighten these and other operational risks. Despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems.



Sustained or repeated system disruptions that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores, impact our customers’ ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information, merchandise, financial or other important information (including personal information) could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In addition, from time to time, we make hardware, software and code modifications and upgrades to our information technology systems for point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance. Modifications involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including not accurately capturing data and system disruptions. Information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Any significant compromise or breach of our data security, including the security of customer, associate, third-party or company information, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In the operation of our business, we collect, use, transmit and otherwise process a large volume of personal and other confidential, proprietary and sensitive information. Information systems are susceptible to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Any significant compromise or breach of our data security, media reports about such an incident, whether accurate or not, or our failure to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public or law enforcement agencies following any such event, whether due to delayed discovery or a failure to follow existing protocols, could significantly damage our reputation with our customers, associates, investors and other third parties, cause the disclosure of personal, confidential, proprietary or sensitive customer, associate, third-party or company information, cause interruptions to our operations and distraction to our management, cause our customers to stop shopping with us and result in significant legal, regulatory and financial liabilities and lost revenues.

While we train our associates and have implemented systems, processes and confidential security measures to protect our physical facilities and information technology systems against unauthorized access and prevent data loss, there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. Despite these measures, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, malware, ransomware, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or similar events. Our systems and facilities are also subject to compromise from internal threats, such as theft, misuse, unauthorized access or other improper actions by employees, third-party service providers and other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems, website or facilities. Furthermore, because the methods of cyber-attack and deception change frequently, are increasingly complex and sophisticated, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including nation-state actors, despite our reasonable efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and website, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, detect, appropriately react and respond to, or implement effective preventative measures against, all cybersecurity incidents.

In addition to our own systems, networks and databases, we use third-party service providers to store, transmit and otherwise process certain of this information on our behalf. Due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for any cybersecurity incident attributed to our service providers as they relate to the information we share with them or to which they are granted access. Although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems.

We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against, respond to, and recover from any potential, attempted, or existing cybersecurity incidents. As cybersecurity incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. In addition, our remediation efforts may not be successful. The inability to implement, maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Moreover, there could be public announcements regarding any cybersecurity incidents and any steps we take to respond to or remediate such incidents, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these announcements to be negative, it could, among other things, have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.

While we currently maintain cybersecurity insurance, such insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to breaches, failures or other data security-related incidents, and we cannot be certain that cyber insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance



coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Changes in laws or regulations relating to data privacy and security, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations, or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy and security, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We are, and may increasingly become, subject to various laws and regulations, as well as contractual obligations, relating to data privacy and security in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and it is possible that they will be interpreted and applied in ways that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In the U.S., various federal and state regulators, including governmental agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, all of which may complicate compliance efforts. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which increases privacy rights for California residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information, went into effect on January 1, 2020. Among other things, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and provide such consumers new data protection and privacy rights, including the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. This private right of action may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. In addition, laws in all 50 U.S. states require businesses to provide notice to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. State laws are changing rapidly and there is discussion in Congress of a new comprehensive federal data privacy law to which we would become subject if it is enacted.

We are subject to international laws, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions, which apply broadly to the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information. For example, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increased the European Commission’s jurisdictional reach of its laws and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data. EU member states are tasked under the GDPR to enact, and have enacted, certain implementing legislation that adds to and/or further interprets the GDPR requirements and potentially extends our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet such obligations. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU member states and the United Kingdom governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, use, retain, protect, disclose, transfer and otherwise process personal data. In particular, the GDPR includes obligations and restrictions concerning the consent and rights of individuals to whom the personal data relates, the transfer of personal data out of the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, security breach notifications and the security and confidentiality of personal data. The GDPR authorizes fines for certain violations of up to 4% of global annual revenue or €20 million, whichever is greater.

All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs, such as costs related to organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training associates and engaging consultants, which are likely to increase over time. In addition, such requirements may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, distract management or divert resources from other initiatives and projects, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal, state or similar foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation and our relationship with our customers, as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or customers, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, which would subject us to significant fines, sanctions, awards, penalties or judgments, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We may be impacted by our ability to comply with regulatory requirements.

We are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. Our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations, including those required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”), among others. Although we have put in place policies and procedures aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance, our



associates, subcontractors, vendors, licensees, franchisees and other third parties could take actions that violate these laws and regulations. Any violations of such laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

It can be difficult to comply with sometimes conflicting regulations in local, national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations. Also, changes in such laws could make operating our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business. For example, changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs for certain merchandise, or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale. It may be difficult for us to oversee regulatory changes impacting our business, and our responses to changes in the law could be costly and may negatively impact our operations.

We may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters.

We, along with third parties we do business with, are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, tort, intellectual property, customer, employment, wage and hour, data privacy, securities, anti-corruption and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. The cost of defending against these types of claims against us or the ultimate resolution of such claims, whether by settlement or adverse court decision, may harm our business. Further, potential claimants may be encouraged to bring suits based on a settlement from us or adverse court decisions against us. We cannot currently assess the likely outcome of such suits, but if the outcome were negative, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In addition, we may be impacted by litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, the market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We may be impacted by changes in taxation, trade and other regulatory requirements.

We are subject to income tax in local, national and international jurisdictions. In addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. Fluctuations in tax rates and duties, changes in tax legislation or regulation or adverse outcomes of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

There is increased uncertainty with respect to tax policy and trade relations between the U.S. and other countries. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Typically, when space is leased for a retail store in a mall or shopping center, we supply all improvements, including interior walls, floors, ceilings, fixtures and decorations. The cost of improvements varies widely, depending on the design, size and location of the store. In certain cases, the landlord of the property may provide an allowance to fund all or a portion of the cost of improvements, serving as a lease incentive.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

We are a defendant in a variety of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. Actions filed against our Company from time to time include commercial, tort, intellectual property, customer, employment, data privacy, securities and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any litigation, in the opinion of management, our current legal proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In July 2019, a plaintiff shareholder filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio alleging that we made false and/or misleading statements relating to the November 2018 announcement that we were



reducing our quarterly dividend. In September 2019, a different plaintiff shareholder filed a second putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio containing substantially the same allegations and seeking substantially the same relief.  In October 2019, the Court issued an order consolidating the two putative class actions, appointing a lead plaintiff, and approving that lead plaintiff’s selection of lead counsel.  The lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint on December 20, 2019 that asserted substantially the same allegations and sought substantially the same relief as the initial complaint.  We filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on February 18, 2020.  The lead plaintiff must file any opposition to our motion to dismiss no later than May 4, 2020.  Our reply brief in further support of our motion to dismiss is due on June 3, 2020.  We view this lawsuit as meritless and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously.

On February 19, 2020, a plaintiff shareholder filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio alleging derivative claims on behalf of L Brands, Inc. against certain current and former directors and officers of L Brands, Inc.  We were named as nominal defendant.  The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste and unjust enrichment in connection with alleged misstatements about our quarterly dividend prior to the announced reduction of the dividend in November 2018. We intend to seek dismissal of the lawsuit.

(e)

The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales is calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis.  Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2019, 2018, 2016, and 2015 were calculated on a 52-to-52-week basis, and the percentage change in comparable sales for 2017 was calculated on a 53-to-53-week basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis.

Number of stores and selling square feet excludes independently owned Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories, Victoria's Secret, PINK, Bath & Body Works and La Senza stores operated by our partners.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") as codified in the Accounting Standards Codification. The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in Item


. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Our operating results are generally impacted by economic changes and, therefore, we monitor the retail environment using, among other things, certain key industry performance indicators including competitor performance and mall traffic data. These can provide insight into consumer spending patterns and shopping behavior in the current retail environment and assist us in assessing our performance as well as the potential impact of industry trends on our future operating results. Additionally, we evaluate a number of key performance indicators including comparable sales, gross profit, operating income and other performance metrics such as sales per average selling square foot and inventory per selling square foot in assessing our performance.

Executive Overview

Beginning in 2018, we began making significant changes in our business to focus resources on core categories to enhance performance and accelerate growth.  In 2018, these actions included:

•

Closing Henri Bendel;



•

Selling the La Senza business; and

•

Reducing our regular dividend.

Further, on February 20, 2020, we announced the sale of 55% of the Victoria's Secret business to Sycamore for proceeds of approximately $525 million.  The transaction is designed to best position our brands for long-term success and drive shareholder value, and we believe this transaction will highlight the value and performance of the standalone Bath & Body Works business, enhance management focus and reduce structural complexity.

We have a multi-year goal to grow Bath & Body Works and increase operating margins by focusing on these key business priorities:

•

Grow our business in North America;

•

Extend our brand internationally; and

•

Focus on the fundamentals of our business.

We also continue to focus on:

•

Attracting and retaining top talent;

•

Maintaining a strong cash and liquidity position while optimizing our capital structure; and

•

Returning value to our shareholders.

The following is a discussion regarding certain of our key business priorities:

Grow our business in North America

The core assortment of Bath & Body Works is body care, home fragrance products, soaps and sanitizers, which together make up the majority of sales and profits for the business. We see clear opportunities for substantial growth in these categories by focusing on product newness and innovation and expanding into under-penetrated market and price segments. We will continue to invest in the White Barn concept, which continues to yield strong results. In


, we plan to increase our square footage at Bath & Body Works North America through the opening of new Bath & Body Works stores, substantially in off-mall locations, and the remodeling of existing stores.

Our Bath & Body Works direct business, with over $950 million in sales and an operating margin in excess of 20%, grew sales by 32% over last year.  We continue to invest in direct channel fulfillment to further accelerate growth.

Extend our brand internationally

We believe there is substantial opportunity for international growth. We have a separate, dedicated team that has taken a methodical, "test and learn" approach to expansion. We plan to expand our presence outside of North America by increasing the number of stores operated by our international partners.  Our partners opened 43 net new Bath & Body Works stores in


, bringing the total in the Middle East, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Europe to


stores. Our partners plan to open additional stores in


.

Focus on the fundamentals of our business

We are focused on the fundamentals of our business which include knowing our customers, focusing on core merchandise categories, inventory management, speed and agility, managing real estate and store selling and execution. In terms of speed and agility, we are focused on inventory discipline through lead-time reductions and in-season agility to increase sales and reduce promotional activity.  In terms of real estate, we will continue to proactively and rigorously review our portfolio, and we will continue to open and close stores when we believe it makes sense to do so. Finally, we continue to optimize our store selling and execution by concentrating on a better store experience and developing, retaining and investing in talented, trained and productive store associates.


Overview

L Brands' overall financial performance in 2019 was below our expectations. Operating income declined as growth at Bath & Body Works was more than offset by declines at Victoria’s Secret.  Our net sales

decreased

$323 million

to

$12.914 billion

primarily driven by Victoria's Secret and the sale of La Senza and closure of Henri Bendel in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our operating income decreased

$979 million

to

$258 million

, primarily due to Victoria's Secret underperformance, and goodwill and long-lived store asset impairment charges.  Our operating income rate decreased to

2.0%

from

9.3%

.

At Bath & Body Works, an aligned, experienced leadership team and strong customer response to our merchandise assortments, driven by a close connection to our customer and a fast and agile supply chain, resulted in another record year, on top of a record 2018. In 2019, Bath & Body Works’ comparable sales increased 10% and operating income increased 11%. Sales in the digital



channel increased 32%. We ended the year with more than 800 newly remodeled stores, which include the White Barn store design. These stores present a new, compelling store experience for the brand and customers alike, driving sales growth.

Victoria’s Secret underperformed in 2019.  Reduced traffic resulted in increased promotion that negatively impacted margin rates.  Victoria’s Secret segment comparable sales declined 7% for the year, and operating income declined to a loss of $616 million, due to a $690 million goodwill impairment charge and sales and margin underperformance.

In Victoria’s Secret Lingerie, comparable sales declined in the high-single digit range in 2019, and the merchandise margin rate declined significantly.  In the fourth quarter, we continued to pull back on promotional activity in bras, and while sales were down significantly, the merchandise margin rate was up.  Sleepwear performance was below our expectations, with sales and merchandise margin rate down significantly to last year.

PINK comparable sales declined in the low-double digit range in 2019, and the merchandise margin rate declined significantly.  Growth in bras and panties was more than offset by a decline in apparel, particularly in tops.

Victoria’s Secret Beauty had a good year and a solid holiday performance, with positive low-single digit comparable sales and an improvement in the merchandise margin rate.

Outside North America, we opened 59 net new stores in 2019, ending the year with 812 stores. Revenue in our international segment was about flat in 2019 compared to last year, and the operating loss increased by $199 million, primarily driven by store asset and goodwill impairment charges in Greater China.

For additional information related to our


financial performance, see “Results of Operations –


Compared to


.”

We are committed to returning value to our shareholders.  During


, we paid

$332 million

in dividends. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs. Since 2000, we have returned approximately

$21 billion

to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.



Adjusted Financial Information

In addition to our results provided in accordance with GAAP above and throughout this Form 10-K, provided below are non-GAAP measurements which present operating income, net income and earnings per share in


,


and


on an adjusted basis, which remove certain special items. We believe that these special items are not indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and nature. We use adjusted financial information as key performance measures of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Instead, we believe that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. Further, our definition of adjusted financial information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The table below reconciles the GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures.

Outlook

On February 20, 2020, we announced the sale of 55% of the Victoria’s Secret business to Sycamore for proceeds of approximately $525 million.  The transaction is the result of a comprehensive review of a broad range of options undertaken by our Board of Directors, with input from outside financial advisors, designed to best position our brands for long-term success and drive shareholder value.  We believe this transaction will highlight the value and performance of the standalone Bath & Body Works business, enhance management focus and reduce structural complexity.

Additionally, we believe that a private entity structure creates the best environment for a Victoria’s Secret turnaround.  We believe that Sycamore, which has substantial experience in the retail industry, will bring a new perspective and greater focus to the business. We are pleased that, by retaining a significant ownership stake, our shareholders will have the ability to meaningfully participate in the upside potential of this iconic brand.

Over the next several months, we will be reviewing the functional and corporate support required for the standalone Bath & Body Works business, with a view to simplify our existing structure, while recognizing that we will still be supporting the Victoria’s Secret businesses through a Transition Services Agreement with various terms for different services, which will minimize near-term dissynergies.

The management team, in conjunction with our Board, will also be evaluating the capital structure and cash priorities for the standalone Bath & Body Works business.

Upon the Closing, which is expected to occur in the second quarter, Leslie H. Wexner will step down as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board to become Chairman Emeritus, remaining as a member of the Board. Andrew Meslow, Chief Executive Officer of Bath & Body Works, will be appointed by the Board as the Chief Executive Officer of L Brands, Inc. and as a director of L Brands, Inc., effective upon the Closing. Sarah E. Nash, a member of the Board, will be appointed as the Chair of the Board effective upon the Closing.

The global retail sector and our business continue to face an uncertain environment and, as a result, we will continue to manage our business thoughtfully, and we will focus on the execution of the retail fundamentals.

At the same time, we are aggressively focusing on bringing compelling merchandise assortments, marketing and store and online experiences to our customers. We will look for, and seek to capitalize on, those opportunities available to us.

We are closely monitoring the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan, China and has since spread globally. The coronavirus has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a “pandemic,” has spread to many countries, including the U.S., and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A public health epidemic, including the coronavirus, poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an unknown period of time. Related industries in the U.S. and across the



world may be adversely affected, including manufacturing and textile production. The situation and preventative or protective actions that governments around the world have taken to contain the spread of the coronavirus have resulted in a period of disruption, including closure of stores where our products are sold, limited store operating hours, reduced customer traffic and consumer spending, labor shortages and delays in manufacturing and shipping of products and raw materials in the U.S., China and other countries. To the extent the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, we may have difficulty obtaining the materials necessary for the manufacturing of our products, factories which produce our products may remain closed for sustained periods of time, and industry-wide shipment of products may be negatively impacted. Further, if the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, consumer behavior may be altered for an extended period of time which would impact our cash and liquidity and financial condition.  The coronavirus and resulting economic disruption has also led to significant volatility in the capital markets and may adversely impact our stock price and ability to access cash.  Any one adverse effect of the coronavirus, or a combination of adverse effects, could materially impact our results and financial condition.

These recent developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Additional information on this risk and other uncertainties and factors, is set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

(a)

The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels.  The change in comparable sales provides an indication of period over period growth (decline).  A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales is calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis.  Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2019 and 2018 was calculated on a 52-to-52-week basis.  Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis.

.  Victoria's Secret Lingerie comparable sales were down in the high-single digit range, primarily due to declines in bras and apparel, driven by merchandise performance.  PINK comparable sales were down in the low-double digit range, primarily driven by declines in apparel, principally in tops, due to merchandise performance and the exit of the swim business.  Victoria’s Secret Beauty comparable sales increased in the low-single digit range, as growth in accessories and PINK beauty were partially offset by a decline in the lip business.

The decrease in comparable sales was driven by declines in store traffic, average unit retail and digital conversion.

, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales)

decreased

to

34.5%

from

primarily as a result of:

Victoria’s Secret

For


, the gross profit decrease was primarily driven by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales, partially offset by a reduction in long-lived store asset impairment charges, from $70 million in 2018 to $51 million in 2019.

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotions to drive traffic and clear inventory, combined with buying and occupancy deleverage on lower net sales.

Bath & Body Works

For


, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales

,

partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to higher distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales and investments in store real estate.

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increases in supply chain and sourcing costs and the sales mix shift into the direct business, which has a lower merchandise margin rate than the stores channel.



Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International

For


, the gross profit decrease was primarily due to the increase in long-lived store asset impairment charges, related to stores in Greater China, the U.K. and Ireland, from $31 million in 2018 to $212 million in 2019.

The gross profit (loss) rate decrease was driven by the increase in long-lived store asset impairment charges.

General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses

For


, our general, administrative and store operating expenses

decreased

$91 million

to

$3.472 billion

due to the elimination of the La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses and lower marketing and store selling expenses at Victoria's Secret, partially offset by higher selling and marketing expenses related to higher sales volume at Bath & Body Works.

The general, administrative and store operating expense rate remained flat at 26.9% as the absence of the higher-rate La Senza and Henri Bendel businesses and declines in marketing and store selling expenses at Victoria's Secret were offset by deleverage on lower net sales.

Impairment of Goodwill

In 2019, our goodwill impairment assessments concluded that the carrying values of our Victoria's Secret and Greater China reporting units exceeded their fair values.  Accordingly, we recognized pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $690 million and $30 million in the Victoria's Secret and Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segments, respectively.

Loss on Divestiture of La Senza

In 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of La Senza of

$99 million

related to the recognition of $45 million of accumulated translation adjustments and the loss related to the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.

$

66 million

to a $61 million loss due to a $40 million pre-tax loss associated with the early extinguishment of $764 million in outstanding notes maturing between 2020 and 2022 and $37 million of charges to increase reserves related to ongoing contingent obligations for the La Senza business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Provision for Income Taxes

For


, our effective tax rate was

(101.9%)

compared to

24.9%

in 2018. The


rate varied from our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the Victoria's Secret goodwill impairment charges, which generated minimal tax benefit. The


rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the tax effects of the divestiture of the La Senza business.

Additionally, net sales increased as a result of the change in presentation for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement.

The decrease in comparable store sales was driven by lower average unit retail and reduced traffic.

Bath & Body Works

For the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales increased $157 million to $1.951 billion; comparable sales increased 12%; and comparable store sales increased 8%. Net sales increased in most categories including home fragrance, body care and soaps and sanitizers, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion.

The increase in comparable store sales was driven by higher average dollar sales and conversion.

Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International

For the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales increased $20 million to $190 million, due to new company-owned Victoria's Secret stores, direct channel growth in Greater China and additional stores opened by our partners. These increases were partially offset by a decline at Victoria's Secret U.K.

Other

For the fourth quarter of 2018, net sales decreased $11 million to $179 million due to declines in La Senza and Henri Bendel as we divested La Senza and closed Henri Bendel in the quarter.

Gross Profit

For the fourth quarter of 2018, our gross profit decreased $72 million to $1.968 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 40.6% from 42.3% primarily as a result of:

Victoria’s Secret

For the fourth quarter of 2018, the gross profit decrease was driven by lower merchandise margin dollars related to the decrease in net sales, increased promotional activity to drive traffic and clear inventory and due to $20 million of long-lived store asset impairment charges related to certain stores in the U.S.

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotional activity and the long-lived store asset impairment charges.

Bath & Body Works

For the fourth quarter of 2018, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales and reduced promotional activity, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to higher distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales and investments in store real estate.

The gross profit rate increase was driven by lower promotional activity.



Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International

For the fourth quarter of 2018, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to higher net sales in Greater China and additional stores opened by our partners.

The gross profit rate increase was driven by buying and occupancy leverage on higher net sales.

General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses

For the fourth quarter of 2018, our general, administrative and store operating expenses increased $16 million to $1.069 billion primarily driven by the change in presentation for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement, incremental wage investments and higher selling expenses related to higher sales volumes at Bath & Body Works, partially offset by lower selling expenses and fashion show costs at Victoria's Secret.

The general, administrative and store operating expense rate increased to 22.0% from 21.8% due to the presentation change for income received from our Victoria's Secret private label credit card and incremental wage investments.

Loss on Divestiture of La Senza

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of La Senza of

$99 million

related to the recognition of $45 million of accumulated translation adjustments and the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.

Other Income and Expense

Interest Expense

The following table provides the average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017:

For the fourth quarter of 2018, our interest expense decreased $13 million to $93 million due to a lower average borrowing rate and lower average daily borrowings.

Other Income (Loss)

For the fourth quarter of 2018, our other income (loss) increased $42 million to $4 million of income primarily driven by a $45 million pre-tax loss on extinguishment of the 2019 Notes recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Provision for Income Taxes

For the fourth quarter of 2018, our effective tax rate increased to 24.0% from 21.1%. The 2018 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the tax effects of the divestiture of the La Senza business. The 2017 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the benefit related to changes in U.S. tax legislation.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining our financial stability. We are committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. Cash generated from our operating activities provides the primary resources to support current operations, growth initiatives, seasonal funding requirements and capital expenditures. Our cash provided from operations is impacted by our net income (loss) and working capital changes. Our net income (loss) is impacted by, among other things, sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, success of new product introductions, profit margins and income taxes. Historically, sales are higher during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, our need for working capital peaks during the summer and fall months as inventory builds in anticipation of the holiday period.  Our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were

$265 million

as of

February 1, 2020

.

On February 20, 2020, we and Sycamore entered into a definitive agreement that is intended to deliver long-term value to L Brands, Inc. shareholders by positioning Bath & Body Works as a standalone public company and transitioning Victoria's Secret, including business conducted under the Victoria's Secret and PINK brands and certain support functions, into a privately-held entity.



After taking into account certain liabilities, Sycamore will purchase a 55% interest in Victoria’s Secret for approximately

$525 million

. We intend to use the proceeds from the transaction, along with approximately $500 million of excess balance sheet cash, to reduce debt.  The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to customary closing conditions.

Company Response to Coronavirus

Subsequent to

February 1, 2020

, we announced actions in response to the continued spread of the coronavirus.

On March 16, 2020, in an abundance of caution and as a proactive measure, we elected to borrow

$950 million

from our Secured Revolving Facility, leaving our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility at

$22 million

.

On March 17, 2020, we announced the temporary closure of all Bath & Body Works, Victoria’s Secret and PINK stores in the United States and Canada through March 29, 2020. Associates will continue to receive pay and benefits through April 4, 2020, which is one week longer than originally announced.

Based on the continued spread of the coronavirus and stay-at-home orders by government officials across the country, we are extending the closure of our stores beyond the initial March 29th date. As the situation continues to evolve rapidly, we are not currently able to predict the timing of store reopenings. However, we are monitoring the situation closely and will provide updates as appropriate. We continue to serve customers through our direct channels.

In an effort to further strengthen our financial flexibility and efficiently manage through the pandemic, we are proactively taking the following additional actions:

•

Suspending our quarterly cash dividend beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. We remain committed to paying dividends over the long-term and will re-evaluate when appropriate.

•

Executing a substantial reduction in expenses and capital expenditures.  This includes an ongoing reduction in forward inventory receipts.

•

Temporarily reducing base compensation by 20% for senior vice presidents and above.  The cash compensation of Chairman and CEO Leslie H. Wexner and other members of the Board of Directors has been suspended. Additionally, we are deferring annual merit increases.

•

Furloughing most store associates and those who are not currently working to support the online businesses or who cannot work from home, effective April 5, 2020 until further notice. All furloughed associates will continue to receive existing healthcare benefits. As circumstances change, we will make every effort to bring these associates back to work as soon as possible. Furloughed associates will also be able to apply for unemployment benefits, if eligible.

As of March 27, 2020, we currently have more than $2 billion in cash, which includes the

$950 million

borrowed under the Secured Revolving Facility on March 16, 2020.  Our Secured Revolving Facility has certain financial covenants, including a debt to consolidated EBITDA covenant, which may be breached as early as the end of the fiscal quarter ending May 2, 2020. If we were to violate a covenant, our lenders would have the right to accelerate our Secured Revolving Facility indebtedness, demand cash collateral in respect of the letters of credit issued thereunder and terminate the funding commitments available thereunder.  While we believe that we would be able to obtain temporary waivers for any such breach of a covenant to prevent an acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness or obtain a replacement credit facility, we cannot conclude with certainty that we would have the ability to obtain necessary waivers or negotiate less restrictive debt covenants with our lenders.  We are in active conversations with the lenders under our credit facility to obtain a replacement credit facility that does not contain a debt to consolidated EBITDA financial covenant or a temporary waiver in respect of such financial covenant in our existing Secured Revolving Facility.  We believe that our current cash balance, along with the actions taken as outlined above, provides us with sufficient current liquidity.

Working Capital and Capitalization

We believe that our available short-term and long-term capital resources are sufficient to fund foreseeable requirements.

Common Stock Share Repurchases

Our Board of Directors will determine share repurchase authorizations giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow, capital requirements, current and forecasted liquidity, the restrictions placed upon us by our borrowing arrangements as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time.

:

Issuance of Notes

In June 2019, we issued

$500 million

of

7.50%

notes due in June 2029 ("2029 Notes"). The obligation to pay principal and interest on these notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”). The proceeds from the issuance were

$486 million

, which were net of discounts and issuance costs of

$212 million

of outstanding 2020 Notes,

$330 million

of outstanding 2021 Notes and

$126 million

of outstanding 2020 Notes for

$130 million

.

In the second quarter of 2019, we recognized a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of

$40 million

), which includes redemption fees and the write-off of unamortized issuance costs.  This loss is included in Other Income (Loss) in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).

Exchange of Notes

$52 million

in cash consideration, which included a

$24 million

The obligation to pay principal and interest on the 2027 Notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by the Guarantors.



Secured Revolving Facility

We and the Guarantors guarantee and pledge collateral to secure a revolving credit facility. The Secured Revolving Facility has aggregate availability of

$1 billion

and allows us and certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to borrow and obtain letters of credit in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros, Hong Kong dollars or British pounds.

In August 2019, we entered into an amendment and restatement (“Amendment”) of the Secured Revolving Facility. The Amendment maintained the aggregate availability under the Secured Revolving Facility at

$1 billion

and extended the expiration date from May 2022 to August 2024.  We incurred fees related to the Amendment of

$5 million

, which were capitalized and are recorded in Other Assets on the

February 1, 2020

Consolidated Balance Sheet and are being amortized over the remaining term of the Secured Revolving Facility.

The Secured Revolving Facility fees related to committed and unutilized amounts are

0.30%

per annum, and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit are

1.75%

per annum. In addition, the interest rate on outstanding U.S. dollar borrowings is the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus

1.75%

per annum. The interest rate on outstanding foreign denominated borrowings is the applicable benchmark rate plus

1.75%

per annum.

The Secured Revolving Facility contains fixed charge coverage and debt to EBITDA financial covenants. We are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than

1.75

to

1.00

and a consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio not exceeding

4.00

to

1.00

for the most recent four-quarter period. Additionally, the Secured Revolving Facility provides that investments and restricted payments may be made, without limitation on amount, if (a) at the time of and after giving effect to such investment or restricted payment, the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four-quarter period is less than

3.50

to

1.00

and (b) no default or event of default exists. As of

February 1, 2020

, we were in compliance with both of our financial covenants, and the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was less than

3.50

to

1.00

.

During


, we borrowed and repaid

$12 million

under the Secured Revolving Facility.  As of

February 1, 2020

, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Secured Revolving Facility.

The Secured Revolving Facility supports our letter of credit program. We had

$19 million

of outstanding letters of credit as of

February 1, 2020

that reduced our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility.

On March 16, 2020, as a proactive measure in response to the continued spread of the coronavirus, we elected to borrow

$950 million

from the Secured Revolving Facility, leaving our availability under the Secured Revolving Facility at $22 million.

Secured Foreign Facilities

We and the Guarantors guarantee and pledge collateral to secure revolving and term loan bank facilities used by certain of our Greater China subsidiaries to support their operations ("Secured Foreign Facilities"). The Secured Foreign Facilities have availability totaling

$150 million

. The interest rates on outstanding borrowings are based upon the applicable benchmark rate for each borrowing.  During


, we borrowed

$117 million

and made payments of

$103 million

under the Secured Foreign Facilities. The maximum daily amount outstanding at any point in time in


was

$103 million

. Borrowings on the Secured Foreign Facilities mature between March 2020 and August 2024. As of

February 1, 2020

, borrowings of

$11 million

are included within Current Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the remaining borrowings are included within Long-term Debt.

February 1, 2020

, borrowings of

$50 million

are included within Current Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Credit Ratings

Our borrowing costs under our Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities are linked to our credit ratings. If we receive an upgrade or downgrade to our corporate credit ratings, the borrowing costs could decrease or increase, respectively. The guarantees of our obligations under the Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities by the Guarantors and the security interests granted in our and the Guarantors’ collateral securing such obligations are released if our credit ratings are higher than a certain level. Additionally, the restrictions imposed under the Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities on our ability to make investments and to make restricted payments cease to apply if our credit ratings are higher than certain levels. Credit rating downgrades by any of the agencies do not accelerate the repayment of any of our debt.



The following table provides our credit ratings as of

February 1, 2020

:

Subsequent to

February 1, 2020

, Moody's downgraded our Corporate and Senior Unsecured Debt with Subsidiary Guarantee ratings to Ba3, our Senior Unsecured Debt rating to B2 and updated our outlook to Stable.  Additionally, S&P downgraded our Corporate and Senior Unsecured Debt with Subsidiary Guarantee ratings to B+, our Senior Unsecured Debt rating to B- and updated our outlook to Negative.

Contingent Liabilities and Contractual Obligations

The following table provides our contractual obligations, aggregated by type, including the maturity profile as of

February 1, 2020

:

________________

(a)

Long-term debt obligations relate to our principal and interest payments for outstanding notes and debentures. Interest payments have been estimated based on the coupon rate for fixed rate obligations. Interest obligations exclude amounts which have been accrued through

February 1, 2020

.   For additional information, see Note


to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item


. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

(b)

Future lease obligations primarily represent minimum payments due under store lease agreements.  For additional information, see Note


to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item


. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

(c)

Purchase obligations primarily include purchase orders for merchandise inventory and other agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.

(d)

Other liabilities primarily include future payments relating to our non-qualified supplemental retirement plan of

$280 million

in the "1-3 Years" category.  The definitive agreement between us and Sycamore for the sale to Sycamore of the 55% interest in Victoria's Secret requires that we terminate our non-qualified supplemental retirement plan as of the Closing with respect to participants affected by the sale and for all other participants within six months.  On March 11, 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors authorized management to take steps to terminate the plan as to all participants.  The timing and specifics of such termination have not yet been determined.  Any remaining benefits and obligations under the non-qualified plan are expected to be paid out in full approximately one year following the applicable termination.

(e)

Other liabilities also include future estimated payments associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The “Less Than 1 Year” category includes

$66 million

of these tax items because it is reasonably possible that the amounts could change in the next 12 months due to audit settlements or resolution of uncertainties. The remaining portion totaling $24 million is included in the “Other” category as it is not reasonably possible that the amounts could change in the next 12 months. In addition, we have a remaining liability of $41 million related to the deemed repatriation tax on our undistributed foreign earnings resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  The tax liability will be paid over the next five years.  For additional information, see Note


to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item


. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.



La Senza

In connection with the sale of La Senza in the fourth quarter of 2018, certain of our subsidiaries have remaining contingent obligations of

$40 million

related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through 2028. These obligations include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of the business. As part of the sale, a liability of

$5 million

was recorded for these obligations. During 2019, an additional reserve of

$35 million

was recorded related to these obligations and certain other items.  As of

February 1, 2020

, reserves of

$8 million

are included within Accrued Expenses and Other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the remaining reserves are included within Other Long-term Liabilities.

Other

In connection with noncancelable operating leases of certain assets, we provided residual value guarantees to the lessor if the leased assets cannot be sold for an amount in excess of a specified minimum value at the conclusion of the lease term. The leases expire at various dates through 2021, and the total amount of the guarantees is

$94 million

. We recorded a liability of

$17 million

and

$11 million

related to these guarantee obligations as of

February 1, 2020

and

February 2, 2019

, respectively.  This liability is included in Current Operating Lease Liabilities on the

February 1, 2020

Consolidated Balance Sheet, and in Other Long-term Liabilities on the

February 2, 2019

Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation 229.303 Item 303 (a) (4).

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Leases

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASC 842,

Leases

, which requires companies classified as lessees to account for most leases on their balance sheet but recognize expense on their income statement in a manner similar to legacy accounting. The standard also requires enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, to provide greater insight into the extent of expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing leases.  In July 2018, the FASB approved an amendment to the standard that provides companies a modified retrospective transition option that did not require earlier periods to be restated upon adoption.

We adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019 under the modified retrospective approach.  As allowed by the new standard, we elected the package of transition practical expedients but elected to not apply the hindsight practical expedient to its leases at transition.

Upon adoption at the beginning of 2019, we recorded operating lease liabilities of

$3.7 billion

and operating lease assets for its leases of

$3.3 billion

.  The operating lease assets are net of

$470 million

of liabilities for deferred rent and unamortized landlord construction allowances that were previously recorded as Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  We also recorded a decrease to opening retained earnings, net of tax, of

$2 million

.  The adoption of the standard did not materially impact the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) or Cash Flows.

Hedging Activities

In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-12,

Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities

, which is intended to better align risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships. The standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. It also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019.  The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Goodwill

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04,

Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill.  The standard eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test, which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the implied fair value of goodwill.  Under the new standard, the goodwill impairment charge is the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.  We adopted this standard in the third quarter of 2019 and performed our interim and annual goodwill impairment assessments in accordance with ASU 2017-04.



Credit Losses

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,

which requires the use of a forward-looking expected loss impairment model for accounts receivable and certain other financial instruments. This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted.  We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Impact of Inflation

While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, long-lived assets, claims and contingencies, income taxes and revenue recognition. Management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position.

Inventories

Inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, on a weighted-average cost basis.

We record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates.

We also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory. These estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends.

Management believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate. A 10% increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net loss by approximately

$4 million

for


. A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net loss by approximately

$5 million

for


.

Valuation of Long-lived Assets

Long-lived Store Assets

Long-lived store assets, which include leasehold improvements, store related assets and operating lease assets (subsequent to the adoption of ASC 842,

Leases

), are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Store assets are grouped at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of other assets or asset groups.  If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset group are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value, determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset group.  For operating lease assets, we determine the fair value of the assets by comparing the contractual rent payments to estimated market rental rates. An individual asset within an asset group is not impaired below its estimated fair value.  The fair value of long-lived store assets are determined using Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.

In 2019 and 2018, we concluded that the negative operating results for certain of our Victoria's Secret stores were an indicator of potential impairment of the related store asset groups. We determined that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying values and, as a result, determined the estimated fair values of the store asset groups using estimated discounted future cash flows and estimated market rental rates. Accordingly, we recognized a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of an asset group and its estimated fair value but did not impair any individual store asset below its estimated fair value.



In 2019, we recognized impairment charges of $198 million for leasehold improvements and store related assets. Impairment charges of $151 million related to stores in Greater China, the U.K. and Ireland, and impairment charges of $47 million related to stores in the U.S. and Canada. For operating lease assets, we recognized impairment charges of $65 million.  Impairment charges of $61 million related to stores in Greater China and the U.K., and impairment charges of $4 million related to stores in the U.S.

In total, we recognized impairment charges of $263 million for long-lived store assets, which are included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying & Occupancy in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). Impairment charges of $212 million, related to store assets in Greater China, the U.K. and Ireland, were recorded within the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segment. Impairment charges of $51 million, related to store assets in the U.S. and Canada, were recorded within the Victoria's Secret segment.

In 2018, we recognized impairment charges of $101 million for leasehold improvements and store related assets.  Impairment charges of $70 million, related to stores in the U.S. and Canada, were recorded within the Victoria's Secret segment.  Impairment charges of $31 million, related to stores in the U.K., were recorded within the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segment.  These charges are included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying & Occupancy in the 2018 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).

Our fair value estimates incorporated significant assumptions and judgments including, but not limited to, estimated future cash flows, discount rates and market rental rates.  The use of different assumptions or judgments in our assessment could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our store assets and, accordingly, could materially increase or decrease any related impairment charge.  A three percentage point reduction to our comparable sales assumptions, a key input in determining estimated future cash flows, would not have resulted in a material incremental impairment charge in 2019.  Further sustained declines in our business performance could result in a material impairment charge in a future period.

When a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life.

Goodwill

Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. We have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value (including goodwill), or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value (including goodwill).  If we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.  Our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350,

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.

As a result of goodwill impairment charges recognized in 2019, only the Bath & Body Works reporting unit has goodwill as of February 1, 2020.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2019, we performed a quantitative interim impairment assessment over the Victoria's Secret and Greater China reporting units.  An interim assessment was performed in consideration of the negative performance of these reporting units and their impact on the sustained decline in our market capitalization.  Further, for the Greater China reporting unit, we considered the results of the long-lived store asset impairment assessment.

The interim assessment concluded that the fair value of the Victoria's Secret reporting unit, which was based on a weighted average of the income and market approaches, exceeded its carrying value.  However, the fair value of the Greater China reporting unit, which was based on the income approach, did not exceed its carrying value.  Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $30 million in the third quarter of 2019 related to the Greater China reporting unit.  This charge is included in Impairment of Goodwill in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).

As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment over the Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret reporting units. The fair value of the Bath & Body Works reporting unit was estimated using a weighted average of the income and market approaches.  As a result of continued fourth quarter declines in business performance and increased risk, volatility and uncertainty related to the Victoria's Secret reporting unit, we estimated its fair value using a market approach.

The annual assessment concluded that the fair value of the Victoria's Secret reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value.  Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $690 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the Victoria's Secret reporting unit. This charge is included in Impairment of Goodwill in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).  The annual assessment also concluded that the fair value of the Bath & Body Works reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.



The market approach is based on earnings multiples of selected guideline public companies, while the income approach is based on estimated discounted future cash flows. The approaches, which are determined using Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy, incorporated a number of significant assumptions and judgments including, but not limited to, estimated future cash flows, multiples of earnings of similar public companies, discount rates, income tax rates, terminal growth rates and an implied control premium relative to our market capitalization.

The use of different assumptions or judgments in our goodwill impairment assessment, including with respect to the estimated future cash flows, the earnings multiples used in the market approach, the discount rate used to discount such estimated future cash flows to their net present value and the reasonableness of the implied control premium relative to our market capitalization, could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our reporting units and, accordingly, could materially increase or decrease any related impairment charge.  Declines in our market capitalization or in our business performance could result in a material impairment charge in a future period.

Intangible Assets - Indefinite Lives

Intangible assets with indefinite lives represent the Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works trade names.  Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change.  We have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. To determine if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, we will estimate the fair value, usually determined by the relief from royalty method under the income approach, and compare that value with its carrying amount.  If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2019, we performed a quantitative interim impairment assessment of the Victoria's Secret trade name. An interim assessment was performed in consideration of the negative performance of Victoria's Secret.  To estimate the fair value of the Victoria's Secret trade name, we used the relief from royalty method under the income approach.  The interim assessment concluded that the fair value of the Victoria's Secret trade name exceeded its carrying value.

As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed our annual impairment assessment of the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works trade names.  To estimate the fair value of the trade names, we used the relief from royalty method under the income approach.  The annual assessment concluded that the fair values of the trade names were in excess of their respective carrying values.

The use of different assumptions or judgments in our impairment assessment of our trade names, including with respect to the estimated future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount such estimated future cash flows to their net present value and royalty rates used for the relief from royalty method, could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our trade names.  A 50% reduction to our assumed royalty rate would not have resulted in a material incremental impairment charge in 2019.

Claims and Contingencies

We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. Our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency. We consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. We accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible (as opposed to probable) or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable, disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item


. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.



Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In determining our provision for income taxes, we consider permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings.

We follow the authoritative guidance included in ASC 740,

Income Taxes

, which contains a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may differ from forecasted outcomes. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual, when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.

Revenue Recognition

In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, using the modified retrospective approach.

We  recognize revenue based on the amount we expect to receive when control of the goods or services is transferred to our customer. We recognize sales upon customer receipt of merchandise, which for direct channel revenues reflect an estimate of shipments that have not yet been received by our customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times. Our shipping and handling revenues are included in Net Sales with the related costs included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). We also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience. Net Sales exclude sales and other similar taxes collected from customers.

We offer certain loyalty programs that allow customers to earn points based on purchasing activity. As customers accumulate points and reach point thresholds, they can use the points to purchase merchandise in stores or online. We allocate revenue to points earned on qualifying purchases and defer recognition until the points are redeemed. The amount of revenue deferred is based on the relative stand-alone selling price method, which includes an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed based on historical experience.

We sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers. We do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards. We recognize revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer. In addition, we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions (gift card breakage). Gift card breakage revenue is recognized in proportion, and over the same period, as actual gift card redemptions. We determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage is included in Net Sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

Revenue earned in connection with Victoria’s Secret's private label credit card arrangement is recognized over the term of the license arrangement and is included in Net Sales in our 2019 and 2018 Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

We also recognize revenues associated with franchise, license, wholesale and sourcing arrangements. Revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers. Revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Market Risk

The market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use derivative financial instruments like foreign currency forward contracts, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.



Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

We have operations in foreign countries which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our Canadian dollar, British pound, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong dollar and Euro denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all our merchandise sold in Canada, the U.K., Ireland and Greater China is sourced through U.S. dollar transactions. Although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset risks associated with our operations in Canada and the U.K., these measures may not succeed in offsetting all the short-term impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates.

Further, although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in U.S. dollars, the royalties we receive in U.S. dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency. As a result, our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Interest Rate Risk

Our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer. The primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. Typically, our investment portfolio is comprised of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits. Given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates.

Excluding our Foreign Facilities, all of our long-term debt as of

February 1, 2020

has fixed interest rates. We will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements. Our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

As of

February 1, 2020

, we believe that the carrying values of accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and current debt approximate fair value because of their short maturity.

The following table provides a summary of the principal value and estimated fair value of outstanding publicly traded debt and other financial instruments as of

February 1, 2020

and

:

________________

(a)

The estimated fair value is based on reported transaction prices. The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange.

(b)

Hedge arrangements are in a net asset position.

Concentration of Credit Risk

We maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. We monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. Typically, our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits. We also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

February 1, 2020

. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).

Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of

February 1, 2020

.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young LLP’s report appears on the following page and expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

February 1, 2020

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

%

of the equity interests of Victoria's Secret Holdco to Sycamore. The Company will retain


%

of the equity interests of Victoria's Secret Holdco.  For additional information, see Note


, "Subsequent Events."

Fiscal Year

The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. As used herein, “


” and "


" refer to the 52-week periods ended

February 1, 2020

and

, respectively. “


” refers to the 53-week period ended

February 3, 2018

.

Basis of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The Company accounts for investments in unconsolidated entities where it exercises significant influence, but does not have control, using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company recognizes its share of the investee's net income or loss. Losses are only recognized to the extent the Company has positive carrying value related to the investee. Carrying values are only reduced below

zero

if the Company has an obligation to provide funding to the investee. The Company’s share of net income or loss of unconsolidated entities from which the Company purchases merchandise or merchandise components is included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). The Company’s share of net income or loss of all other unconsolidated entities is included in Other Income (Loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). The Company’s equity method investments are required to be reviewed for impairment when it is determined there may be an other than temporary loss in value.

On January 6, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the La Senza business.  For additional information, see Note


, "Restructuring Activities."

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and Cash Equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions and highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than


days. The Company’s outstanding checks, which totaled

$


million

as of

February 1, 2020

and

$


million

as of

February 2, 2019

, are included in Accounts Payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. The Company monitors the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom the Company transacts and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. Typically, the Company’s investment portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits.

The Company also periodically reviews the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company records an allowance for uncollectable accounts when it becomes probable that the counterparty will be unable to pay.



Inventories

Inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, on a weighted-average cost basis.

The Company records valuation adjustments to its inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount it expects to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand, market conditions and analysis of historical experience.

The Company also records inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory. These estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends.

Advertising Costs

Advertising and marketing costs are expensed at the time the promotion first appears in media, in the store or when the advertising is mailed. Advertising and marketing costs totaled

$


million

for


,

$


million

for


and

$


million

.

Property and Equipment

The Company’s property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis using the following depreciable life ranges:

When a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life. The Company’s cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income (loss). Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and betterments that extend useful lives are capitalized.

Long-lived store assets, which include leasehold improvements, store related assets and operating lease assets (subsequent to the adoption of ASC 842,

Leases

), are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Store assets are grouped at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of other assets or asset groups.  If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset group are less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value, determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset group.  For operating lease assets, the Company determines the fair value of the assets by comparing the contractual rent payments to estimated market rental rates.  An individual asset within an asset group is not impaired below its estimated fair value.  The fair value of long-lived store assets are determined using Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.

Leases and Leasehold Improvements

In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted ASC 842,

Leases

, using the modified retrospective approach. Results for 2019 are presented under ASC 842, while the prior period consolidated financial statements have not been adjusted and continue to be presented under the accounting standard in effect at that time.

The Company leases retail space, office space, warehouse facilities, storage space, equipment and certain other items under operating leases. A substantial portion of the Company’s leases are operating leases for its stores, which generally have an initial term of

ten

years. Annual store rent consists of a fixed minimum amount and/or variable rent based on a percentage of sales exceeding a stipulated amount. Store lease terms generally also require additional payments covering certain operating costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, insurance and taxes. Certain leases contain predetermined fixed escalations of minimum rentals or require periodic adjustments of minimum rentals depending on an index or rate. Additionally, certain leases contain incentives, such as construction allowances from landlords and/or rent abatements subsequent to taking possession of the leased property.



At lease commencement, the Company recognizes an asset for the right to use the leased asset and a liability based on the present value of the unpaid fixed lease payments. Operating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis as lease expense over the lease term. Variable lease payments associated with the Company's leases are recognized upon occurrence of the event or circumstance on which the payments are assessed. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, adjusted for collateral, to determine the present value of its unpaid lease payments.

The Company’s store leases often include options to extend the initial term or to terminate the lease prior to the end of the initial term. The exercise of these options is typically at the sole discretion of the Company. These options are included in determining the initial lease term at lease commencement if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the option. Additionally, the Company may operate stores for a period of time on a month-to-month basis after the expiration of the lease term.

The Company also has leasehold improvements which are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the period from the date the assets are placed in service to the end of the initial lease term. Leasehold improvements made after the inception of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term, including renewal periods, if reasonably assured.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company has certain intangible assets resulting from business combinations and acquisitions that are recorded at cost.

Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level each year in the fourth quarter, and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. The Company has the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value (including goodwill), or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value (including goodwill). If the Company determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company recognizes an impairment charge equal to the difference, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.  The Company's reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350,

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other

.

Intangible assets with indefinite lives represent the Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works trade names.  Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change.  The Company has the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. To determine if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, the Company will estimate the fair value, usually determined by the relief from royalty method under the income approach, and compare that value with its carrying amount.  If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment charge equal to the difference.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of the Company’s foreign operations is generally the applicable local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. The Company’s resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.

Accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments are reclassified to net income (loss) when realized upon sale or upon complete, or substantially complete, liquidation of the investment in the foreign entity.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. All derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.

For derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged item affects earnings. Gains and losses that are reclassified into earnings are recognized in the same line item on the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) as the underlying hedged item.



For derivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings in Other Income (Loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

Fair Value

The authoritative guidance included in ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurement,

defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. This authoritative guidance further establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

•

Level 1—Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices of similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

•

Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

The Company estimates the fair value of financial instruments, property and equipment and goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 820

.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.

In determining the Company’s provision for income taxes, the Company considers permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates. The Company’s effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings.

The Company follows a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than

50%

likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may differ from forecasted outcomes.  The Company's policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

The Company’s income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding the Company’s tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which the Company has established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified. The Company adjusts its tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from its established accrual, when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. The Company includes its tax contingencies accrual, including accrued penalties and interest, in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets unless the liability is expected to be paid within one year. Changes to the tax contingencies accrual, including accrued penalties and interest, are included in Provision for Income Taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).



Self-Insurance

The Company is self-insured for medical, workers’ compensation, property, general liability and automobile liability up to certain stop-loss limits. Such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. IBNR claims are estimated using historical claim information and actuarial estimates.

Noncontrolling Interest

Noncontrolling interest represents the portion of equity interests of consolidated affiliates not owned by the Company.

Share-based Compensation

The Company recognizes all share-based payments to employees and directors as compensation cost over the service period based on their estimated fair value on the date of grant.  The Company estimates award forfeitures at the time awards are granted and adjusts, if necessary, in subsequent periods based on historical experience and expected future forfeitures.

Compensation cost is recognized over the service period for the fair value of awards that actually vest. Compensation expense for awards without a performance condition is recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, using a single award approach (each award is valued as one grant, irrespective of the number of vesting tranches). Compensation expense for awards with a performance condition is recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, using a multiple award approach (each vesting tranche is valued as one grant).

Revenue Recognition

In the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, using the modified retrospective approach. Results for 2019 and 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while results for 2017 have not been adjusted and continue to be presented under the accounting standards in effect for that period.

The Company recognizes revenue based on the amount it expects to receive when control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer. The Company recognizes sales upon customer receipt of merchandise, which for direct channel revenues reflect an estimate of shipments that have not yet been received by the customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times. The Company’s shipping and handling revenues are included in Net Sales with the related costs included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). The Company also provides a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience. Net Sales exclude sales and other similar taxes collected from customers.

The Company offers certain loyalty programs that allow customers to earn points based on purchasing activity. As customers accumulate points and reach point thresholds, they can use the points to purchase merchandise in stores or online. The Company allocates revenue to points earned on qualifying purchases and defers recognition until the points are redeemed. The amount of revenue deferred is based on the relative stand-alone selling price method, which includes an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed based on historical experience.

The Company sells gift cards with no expiration dates to customers. The Company does not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards. The Company recognizes revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer. In addition, the Company recognizes revenue on unredeemed gift cards where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions (gift card breakage). Gift card breakage revenue is recognized in proportion, and over the same period, as actual gift card redemptions. The Company determines the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage is included in Net Sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

Revenue earned in connection with Victoria’s Secret's private label credit card arrangement is recognized over the term of the license arrangement and is included in Net Sales in the 2019 and 2018 Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

The Company also recognizes revenues associated with franchise, license, wholesale and sourcing arrangements. Revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers. Revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner.

Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy

The Company’s costs of goods sold include merchandise costs, net of discounts and allowances, freight and inventory shrinkage. The Company’s buying and occupancy expenses primarily include payroll, benefit costs and operating expenses for its buying departments and distribution network, rent, common area maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance, fulfillment expenses and depreciation for the Company’s stores, warehouse facilities and equipment.



General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses

The Company’s general, administrative and store operating expenses primarily include payroll and benefit costs for its store-selling and administrative departments (including corporate functions), marketing, advertising and other operating expenses not specifically categorized elsewhere in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.

New Accounting Pronouncements

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASC 842,

Leases

, which requires companies classified as lessees to account for most leases on their balance sheet but recognize expense on their income statement in a manner similar to legacy accounting. The standard also requires enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, to provide greater insight into the extent of expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing leases.  In July 2018, the FASB approved an amendment to the standard that provides companies a modified retrospective transition option that did not require earlier periods to be restated upon adoption.

The Company adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019 under the modified retrospective approach.  As allowed by the new standard, the Company elected the package of transition practical expedients but elected to not apply the hindsight practical expedient to its leases at transition.

Upon adoption at the beginning of 2019, the Company recorded operating lease liabilities of

$

3.7

billion

and operating lease assets for its leases of

$

3.3

billion

.  The operating lease assets are net of

$


million

of liabilities for deferred rent and unamortized landlord construction allowances that were previously recorded as Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The Company also recorded a decrease to opening retained earnings, net of tax, of

$


million

.  The adoption of the standard did not materially impact the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) or Cash Flows.  See Note


, “Leases” for additional disclosures required by the new standard.

Hedging Activities

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12,

Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities

, which is intended to better align risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships. The standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. It also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements. The Company adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019.  The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Goodwill

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04,

Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill.  The standard eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test, which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the implied fair value of goodwill.  Under the new standard, the goodwill impairment charge is the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.  The Company adopted this standard in the third quarter of 2019 and performed its interim and annual goodwill impairment assessments in accordance with ASU 2017-04.  For additional information, see Note


, "Goodwill and Trade Names."

Credit Losses

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,

which requires the use of a forward-looking expected loss impairment model for accounts receivable and certain other financial instruments. This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted.  The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.



3.

Revenue Recognition

In the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, using the modified retrospective approach. Results for 2019 and 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while results for 2017 have not been adjusted and continue to be presented under the accounting standards in effect in that period.

Accounts receivable, net from revenue-generating activities were

$


million

as of

February 1, 2020

and

$


million

as of

February 2, 2019

. Accounts receivable primarily relate to amounts due from the Company's franchise, license and wholesale partners. Under these arrangements, payment terms are typically 60 to 90 days.

The Company records deferred revenue when cash payments are received in advance of transfer of control of goods or services. Deferred revenue primarily relates to gift cards, loyalty and private label credit card programs and direct channel shipments, which are all impacted by seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. The balance of deferred revenue was

$


million

as of

February 1, 2020

and

$


million

as of

February 2, 2019

. The Company recognized

$


million

as revenue in


from amounts recorded as deferred revenue at the beginning of the period.  As of

February 1, 2020

, the Company recorded deferred revenues of

$

5.

Restructuring Activities

La Senza

On January 6, 2019, in an effort to increase shareholder value and in order to focus on its larger core businesses, the Company divested its ownership interest in La Senza to an affiliate of Regent LP, a global private equity firm.  Regent LP assumed La Senza’s operating assets and liabilities in exchange for potential future consideration upon the sale or other monetization of La Senza, as defined in the agreement.  In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recognized a pre-tax loss on the divestiture of

$


million

, primarily related to

$


million

of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments reclassified into earnings that were previously recognized as a component of equity, as well as losses related to the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.  The loss is included in Loss on Divestiture of La Senza in the 2018 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).  The after-tax loss on the divestiture was

$


million

, which includes

$


million

of tax benefits primarily associated with the recognition of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets.  In 2019, the Company received cash proceeds of

$


million

related to a net working capital settlement from the divestiture. These proceeds are included within Investing Activities in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

In conjunction with the transaction, certain of the Company's subsidiaries have remaining contingent obligations related to La Senza lease payments under the terms of existing noncancelable leases. In 2019, the Company's subsidiaries recognized pre-tax non-cash charges of

$


million

to increase the reserves for potential exposure related to the La Senza business. These charges are included in Other Income (Loss) in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss). For additional information, see Note


, "Commitments and Contingencies."

Additionally, the Company continues to provide technology and other operational support to La Senza for a period of time expected to continue into fiscal 2020.

Henri Bendel

The Company announced the closure of Henri Bendel in the third quarter of 2018.  As a result, the Company recognized a pre-tax charge, primarily cash, consisting of lease termination costs, severance and other costs of

$


million

in the third quarter of 2018.  In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recognized an additional pre-tax charge of

$


million

, primarily related to contract termination and employee retention costs.  Restructuring charges of

$


million

and

$

Long-Lived Store Assets

In 2019 and 2018, the Company concluded that the negative operating results for certain of its Victoria's Secret stores were an indicator of potential impairment of the related store asset groups. The Company determined that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying values and, as a result, determined the estimated fair values of the store asset groups using estimated discounted future cash flows and estimated market rental rates.  Long-lived store asset impairment charges are included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying & Occupancy in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

The following table provides long-lived store asset impairment charges included in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) for

For leases entered into or reassessed after the adoption of the new standard, the Company has elected the practical expedient allowed by the standard to account for all fixed consideration in a lease as a single lease component.  Therefore, the lease payments used to measure the lease liability for these leases include fixed minimum rentals along with fixed operating costs such as common area maintenance and utilities.

The Company has provided residual value guarantees in connection with noncancelable operating leases of certain assets.  For additional information, see Note

Goodwill and Trade Names

Goodwill

The following table provides detail regarding the composition of goodwill as of

February 1, 2020

and

February 2, 2019

:

As of the end of the third quarter of 2019, the Company performed a quantitative interim impairment assessment over the Victoria's Secret and Greater China reporting units.  An interim assessment was performed in consideration of the negative performance of these reporting units and their impact on the sustained decline in the Company's market capitalization.  Further, for the Greater China reporting unit, the Company considered the results of the long-lived store asset impairment assessment.

The interim assessment concluded that the fair value of the Victoria's Secret reporting unit, which was based on a weighted average of the income and market approaches, exceeded its carrying value.  However, the fair value of the Greater China reporting unit, which was based on the income approach, did not exceed its carrying value.  Accordingly, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of

$


million

in the third quarter of 2019 related to the Greater China reporting unit.  This charge is included in Impairment of Goodwill in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).

As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment over the Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret reporting units.  The fair value of the Bath & Body Works reporting unit was estimated using a weighted average of the income and market approaches. As a result of continued fourth quarter declines in business performance and increased risk, volatility and uncertainty related to the Victoria's Secret reporting unit, the Company estimated its fair value using a market approach.

The annual assessment concluded that the fair value of the Victoria's Secret reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value.  Accordingly, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of

$


million

in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the Victoria's Secret reporting unit. This charge is included in Impairment of Goodwill in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).  The annual assessment also concluded that the fair value of the Bath & Body Works reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.

The market approach is based on earnings multiples of selected guideline public companies, while the income approach is based on estimated discounted future cash flows. The approaches, which are determined using Level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy, incorporated a number of significant assumptions and judgments including, but not limited to, estimated future cash flows, multiples of earnings of similar public companies, discount rates, income tax rates, terminal growth rates and an implied control premium relative to the Company's market capitalization.

:

As of the end of the third quarter of 2019, the Company performed a quantitative interim impairment assessment of the Victoria's Secret trade name. An interim assessment was performed in consideration of the negative performance of Victoria's Secret.  To estimate the fair value of the Victoria's Secret trade name, the Company used the relief from royalty method under the income approach.  The interim assessment concluded that the fair value of the Victoria's Secret trade name exceeded its carrying value.

As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company performed its annual impairment assessment of the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works trade names.  To estimate the fair value of the trade names, the Company used the relief from royalty method under the income approach.  The annual assessment concluded that the fair values of the trade names were in excess of their respective carrying values.

Income Taxes

Current income tax expense represents the amounts expected to be reported on the Company’s income tax returns, and deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in net deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded as appropriate to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount considered likely to be realized.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") was enacted into law. The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The TCJA reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of


%

to a flat


%

rate, effective January 1, 2018.

The following table provides the components of the Company’s provision for income taxes for

February 2, 2019

. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future effects on income taxes resulting from temporary differences and carryforwards at the end of the respective year.

As of

February 1, 2020

, the Company had available for state income tax purposes net operating loss carryforwards which expire, if unused, in the years

2020 through 2039

. For those states where the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that the state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance has been provided.

As of

February 1, 2020

, the Company had available for non-U.S. tax purposes net operating loss carryforwards which have an indefinite life and net operating loss carryforwards which expire, if unused, in the years

2028 through 2039

. For certain jurisdictions where the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that the net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance has been provided on those net operating loss carryforwards as well as other net deferred tax assets.

Uncertain Tax Positions

The following table summarizes the activity related to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits for U.S. federal, state & non-U.S. tax jurisdictions for


,


and


, without interest and penalties:

Of the total gross unrecognized tax benefits, approximately

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

, at

February 1, 2020

,

February 2, 2019

, and

February 3, 2018

, respectively, represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods. These amounts are net of the offsetting tax effects from other tax jurisdictions.

Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, it is reasonably possible that

$


million

could change in the next 12 months due to audit settlements, expiration of statute of limitations or other resolution of uncertainties. Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in amounts which could be different



from this estimate. In such case, the Company will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such matters are effectively settled.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as components of income tax expense. The Company recognized an income tax benefit from interest and penalties of less than

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

in


,


and


, respectively. The Company has accrued

$


million

for the payment of interest and penalties as of both

February 1, 2020

and

February 2, 2019

. Accrued interest and penalties are included within Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company files U.S. federal income tax returns as well as income tax returns in various states and in non-U.S. jurisdictions. The Company is a participant in the Compliance Assurance Process ("CAP"), which is a program made available by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to certain qualifying large taxpayers, under which participants work collaboratively with the IRS to identify and resolve potential tax issues through open, cooperative and transparent interaction prior to the annual filing of their federal income tax return.  The IRS is currently examining the Company's 2018 consolidated U.S. federal income tax return.

The Company is also subject to various U.S. state and local income tax examinations for the years

2015 to 2018

. Finally, the Company is subject to multiple non-U.S. tax jurisdiction examinations for the years

2007 to 2018

. In some situations, the Company determines that it does not have a filing requirement in a particular tax jurisdiction. Where no return has been filed, no statute of limitations applies. Accordingly, if a tax jurisdiction reaches a conclusion that a filing requirement does exist, additional years may be reviewed by the tax authority. The Company believes it has appropriately accounted for uncertainties related to this issue.

Secured Revolving Facility

The Company and the Guarantors guarantee and pledge collateral to secure the Secured Revolving Facility. The Secured Revolving Facility has aggregate availability of

$


billion

and allows the Company and certain of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries to borrow and obtain letters of credit in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros, Hong Kong dollars or British pounds.

In August 2019, the Company entered into an amendment and restatement of the Secured Revolving Facility. The Amendment maintained the aggregate availability under the Secured Revolving Facility at

$


billion

$


million

, which were capitalized and are recorded in Other Assets on the

February 1, 2020

Consolidated Balance Sheet and are being amortized over the remaining term of the Secured Revolving Facility.

The Secured Revolving Facility fees related to committed and unutilized amounts are

0.30

%

per annum, and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit are

1.75

%

per annum. In addition, the interest rate on outstanding U.S. dollar borrowings is LIBOR plus

Derivative Financial Instruments

The earnings of the Company's wholly owned foreign businesses are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all their merchandise is sourced through U.S. dollar transactions. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate this foreign currency exposure for its Canadian and U.K. businesses. These forward contracts currently have a maximum term of


months. Amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income upon the sale of the hedged merchandise to the customer. These gains and losses are recognized in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to recognized payable balances denominated in non-functional currencies. The fair value of these non-designated foreign currency forward contracts is not significant as of

February 1, 2020

.

The following table provides the U.S. dollar notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivative financial instruments as of

Fair Value Measurements

The following table provides a summary of assets and liabilities measured in the consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis as of

February 1, 2020

and

February 2, 2019

:

The Company's Level 1 fair value measurements use unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company's marketable equity securities were classified as Level 1 fair value measurements as they are traded with sufficient frequency and volume to enable the Company to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis.  During 2019, the Company received cash proceeds of

$


million

related to sales of its marketable equity securities, which are included within Investing Activities in the 2019 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

The Company’s Level 2 fair value measurements use market approach valuation techniques. The primary inputs to these techniques include foreign currency exchange rates, as applicable to the underlying instruments.

The following table provides a summary of the principal value and estimated fair value of outstanding publicly traded debt as of

February 1, 2020

Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. Actions filed against the Company from time to time include commercial, tort, intellectual property, customer, employment, data privacy, securities and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. Management believes that the ultimate liability arising from such claims and contingencies, if any, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

In July 2019, a plaintiff shareholder filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio alleging that the Company made false and/or misleading statements relating to the November 2018 announcement that the Company was reducing its quarterly dividend. In September 2019, a different plaintiff shareholder filed a second putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio containing substantially the same allegations and seeking substantially the same relief.  In October 2019, the Court issued an order consolidating the two putative class actions, appointing a lead plaintiff, and approving that lead plaintiff’s selection of lead counsel.  The lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint on December 20, 2019 that asserted substantially the same allegations and sought substantially the same relief as the initial complaint.  The Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on February 18, 2020.  The lead plaintiff must file any opposition to our motion to dismiss no later than May 4, 2020.  The Company's reply brief in further support of our motion to dismiss is due on June 3, 2020.  The Company views this lawsuit as meritless and intends to defend against this lawsuit vigorously.

On February 19, 2020, a plaintiff shareholder filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio alleging derivative claims on behalf of the Company against certain of its current and former directors and officers.  The Company was named as nominal defendant.  The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste and unjust



enrichment in connection with alleged misstatements about our quarterly dividend prior to the announced reduction of the dividend in November 2018. The Company intends to seek dismissal of the lawsuit.

La Senza

In connection with the sale of La Senza in the fourth quarter of 2018, certain of the Company's subsidiaries have remaining contingent obligations of

$


million

related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through 2028. These obligations include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of the business. As part of the sale, a liability of

$


million

was recorded for these obligations. During 2019, an additional reserve of

$


million

was recorded related to these obligations and certain other items.  As of

February 1, 2020

, reserves of

$


million

are included within Accrued Expenses and Other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the remaining reserves are included within Other Long-term Liabilities.

Other

In connection with noncancelable operating leases of certain assets, the Company provided residual value guarantees to the lessor if the leased assets cannot be sold for an amount in excess of a specified minimum value at the conclusion of the lease term. The leases expire at various dates through 2021, and the total amount of the guarantees is

$


million

. The Company recorded a liability of

$


million

and

$


million

related to these guarantee obligations as of

February 1, 2020

and

February 2, 2019

, respectively.  This liability is included in Current Operating Lease Liabilities on the

February 1, 2020

Consolidated Balance Sheet, and in Other Long-term Liabilities on the

February 2, 2019

Consolidated Balance Sheet.

18.

Retirement Benefits

The Company sponsors a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan and a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for substantially all of its associates within the U.S. Participation in the tax-qualified plan is available to associates who meet certain age and service requirements. Participation in the non-qualified plan is available to associates who meet certain age, service, job level and compensation requirements.

The qualified plan permits participating associates to elect contributions up to the maximum limits allowable under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches associate contributions according to a predetermined formula and contributes additional amounts based on a percentage of the associates’ eligible annual compensation and years of service. Associate contributions and Company matching contributions vest immediately. Additional Company contributions and the related investment earnings are subject to vesting based on years of service. Total expense recognized related to the qualified plan was

$


million

for


,

$


million

for


and

$


million

for


.

The non-qualified plan is an unfunded plan which provides benefits beyond the Internal Revenue Code limits for qualified defined contribution plans. The plan permits participating associates to elect contributions up to a maximum percentage of eligible compensation. The Company matches associate contributions according to a predetermined formula and contributes additional amounts based on a percentage of the associates’ eligible compensation and years of service. The plan also permits participating associates to defer additional compensation up to a maximum amount which the Company does not match. Associates’ accounts are credited with interest using a fixed rate determined by the Company and reviewed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors prior to the beginning of each year. Associate contributions and the related interest vest immediately. Company contributions, along with related interest, are subject to vesting based on years of service. Associates may elect in-service distributions for the unmatched additional deferred compensation component only. The remaining vested portion of associates’ accounts in the plan will be distributed upon termination of employment in either a lump sum or in annual installments over a specified period of up to


years.

The definitive agreement between the Company and Sycamore for the sale to Sycamore of the


%

interest in Victoria's Secret requires that the Company terminate its non-qualified supplemental retirement plan as of the closing with respect to participants affected by the sale and for all other participants within six months.  On March 11, 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors authorized management of the Company to take steps to terminate the plan as to all participants.  The timing and specifics of such termination have not yet been determined.  Any remaining benefits and obligations under the non-qualified plan are expected to be paid out in full approximately one year following the applicable termination.  For additional information regarding the Victoria's Secret transaction, see Note


, "Subsequent Events."

Share-based Compensation

Plan Summary

In 2015, the Company's shareholders approved the 2015 Stock Option and Performance Incentive Plan ("2015 Plan"). The 2015 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance-based restricted stock, performance units and unrestricted shares. The Company grants stock options at a price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. Stock options have a maximum term of


years. Stock options generally vest ratably over

three

to

five

years. Restricted stock generally vests (the restrictions lapse) at the end of a

three

-year period or on a graded basis over a

five

-year period.

Under the Company’s plans,


million

options, restricted and unrestricted shares have been authorized to be granted to employees and directors. There were


million

options and shares available for grant as of

February 1, 2020

.



Stock Options

The following table provides the Company’s stock option activity for the fiscal year ended

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for valuation of options granted to employees and directors. The Company’s determination of the fair value of options is affected by the Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.

The following table contains the weighted-average assumptions used during


,


and


:

The majority of the Company’s stock-based compensation awards are granted on an annual basis in the first quarter of each year. The expected volatility assumption is based on the Company’s analysis of historical volatility.

Subsequent Events

Victoria's Secret Transaction

On February 20, 2020, the Company and Sycamore entered into a definitive agreement that is intended to deliver long-term value to L Brands, Inc. shareholders by positioning Bath & Body Works as a standalone public company and transitioning Victoria's Secret, including business conducted under the Victoria's Secret and PINK brands and certain support functions, into a privately-held entity.

After taking into account certain liabilities, Sycamore will purchase a


%

interest in Victoria’s Secret for approximately

$


million

. The Company will retain a


%

interest in Victoria’s Secret to enable its shareholders to participate in the upside potential of the business. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the transaction, along with excess balance sheet cash, to reduce debt.  The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to customary closing conditions.  The Company will report the results of Victoria's Secret as discontinued operations beginning in the first quarter of 2020.  The Company expects to recognize a loss in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of classifying Victoria's Secret as held for sale.

Legal Proceedings

On February 19, 2020, a plaintiff shareholder filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio alleging derivative claims on behalf of the Company against certain of its current and former directors and officers.  For additional information, see Note


, "Commitments and Contingencies."

Company Response to Coronavirus

Subsequent to

February 1, 2020

, the Company announced actions in response to the continued spread of the coronavirus.

On March 16, 2020, in an abundance of caution and as a proactive measure, the Company elected to borrow

$


million

from its Secured Revolving Facility, leaving its availability under the Secured Revolving Facility at

$


million

.

On March 17, 2020, the Company announced the temporary closure of all Bath & Body Works, Victoria’s Secret and PINK stores in the United States and Canada through March 29, 2020. Associates will continue to receive pay and benefits through April 4, 2020, which is one week longer than originally announced.

Based on the continued spread of the coronavirus and stay-at-home orders by government officials across the country, the Company is extending the closure of its stores beyond the initial March 29th date. As the situation continues to evolve rapidly, the Company is not currently able to predict the timing of store reopenings. However, it is monitoring the situation closely and will provide updates as appropriate. The Company continues to serve customers through its direct channels.

In an effort to further strengthen its financial flexibility and efficiently manage through the pandemic, the Company is proactively taking the following additional actions:

•

Suspending its quarterly cash dividend beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The Company remains committed to paying dividends over the long-term and will re-evaluate when appropriate.

•

Executing a substantial reduction in expenses and capital expenditures.  This includes an ongoing reduction in forward inventory receipts.

•

Temporarily reducing base compensation by 20% for senior vice presidents and above.  The cash compensation of Chairman and CEO Leslie H. Wexner and other members of the Board of Directors has been suspended. Additionally, the Company is deferring annual merit increases.

•

Furloughing most store associates and those who are not currently working to support the online businesses or who cannot work from home, effective April 5, 2020 until further notice. All furloughed associates will continue to receive existing healthcare benefits. As circumstances change, the Company will make every effort to bring these associates back to work as soon as possible. Furloughed associates will also be able to apply for unemployment benefits, if eligible.

As of March 27, 2020, the Company currently has more than $2 billion in cash, which includes the

$


million

borrowed under the Secured Revolving Facility on March 16, 2020.  The Company's Secured Revolving Facility has certain financial covenants, including a debt to consolidated EBITDA covenant, which may be breached as early as the end of the fiscal quarter ending May 2, 2020. If the Company were to violate a covenant, its lenders would have the right to accelerate the Company's Secured Revolving Facility indebtedness, demand cash collateral in respect of the letters of credit issued thereunder and terminate the funding commitments available thereunder.  While the Company believes that it would be able to obtain temporary waivers for any such breach of a covenant to prevent an acceleration of its outstanding indebtedness or obtain a replacement credit facility, the Company cannot conclude with certainty that it would have the ability to obtain necessary waivers or negotiate less restrictive debt covenants with its lenders.  The Company is in active conversations with the lenders



under its credit facility to obtain a replacement credit facility that does not contain a debt to consolidated EBITDA financial covenant or a temporary waiver in respect of such financial covenant in its existing Secured Revolving Facility.  The Company believes that its current cash balance, along with the actions taken as outlined above, provides it with sufficient current liquidity.
