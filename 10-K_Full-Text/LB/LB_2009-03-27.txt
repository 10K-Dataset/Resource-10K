PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

Limited Brands, Inc. (the
“Company”) cautions that any forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) contained in this report or made by the Company or management of the Company involve risks and
uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward-looking
statements. Words such as “estimate,” “project,” “plan,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “planned,” “potential” and similar expressions may
identify forward-looking statements.

A number of factors could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking
statements, including those detailed under the heading, “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.

GENERAL.

We operate in the highly competitive specialty retail business. We are a specialty retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products
and accessories under various trade names. We sell our merchandise through our retail stores in the United States and Canada, which are primarily mall-based, and through our websites and catalogues.

FISCAL YEAR.

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to
January 31. As used herein, “2009”, “2008”, “2007” and “2005” refer to the 52 week periods ending January 30, 2010, January 31, 2009, February 2, 2008 and January 28, 2006,
respectively. “2006” refers to the 53 week period ended February 3, 2007.

DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS.

As of January 31, 2009, we conducted our business in two primary segments: Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works.

VICTORIA’S SECRET

The Victoria’s Secret segment
sells women’s intimate and other apparel, personal care and beauty products and accessories under the Victoria’s Secret and La Senza brand names. Victoria’s Secret merchandise is sold through retail stores, its website,

www.VictoriasSecret.com,

and its catalogue. Through its website and catalogue, certain of Victoria’s Secret’s merchandise may be purchased worldwide. La Senza products may also be purchased through its website,

www.LaSenza.com.

In January 2007, we completed our acquisition of La Senza Corporation (“La Senza”). La Senza is a Canadian specialty
retailer offering lingerie and sleepwear as well as apparel for girls in the 7-14 year age group. In addition, La Senza licensees operate independently owned stores in 45 other countries. The results of La Senza are included in the Victoria’s
Secret segment. For additional information, see Note 6 and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The Victoria’s Secret segment had net sales of $5.604 billion in 2008 and operated 1,043 stores in the United States and 322 stores in Canada.


BATH & BODY WORKS

The Bath & Body Works segment sells personal care, beauty and home fragrance products under the Bath & Body Works, C.O. Bigelow and White Barn Candle Company brand names in addition to third-party brands. Bath &
Body Works merchandise is sold through retail stores, its website,

www.bathandbodyworks.com,

and its catalogue.

The Bath & Body Works
segment had net sales of $2.374 billion for 2008 and operated 1,638 stores in the United States.

OTHER

Other consists of the following:

SUMMARY OF COMPANY-OWNED RETAIL LOCATIONS

The following chart provides the retail businesses and the number of our company-owned retail stores in operation for each business as of January 31, 2009 and
February 2, 2008.


The following table provides the changes in
the number of our company-owned retail stores operated for the past five fiscal years:

(a)

Express and Limited Stores were divested in July 2007 and August 2007, respectively.

(b)

Represents stores acquired in the La Senza acquisition on January 12, 2007.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

During 2008, we
purchased merchandise from over 1,000 suppliers located throughout the world. Excluding Mast and Beauty Avenues, no supplier provided 10% or more of our merchandise purchases.

Most of the merchandise and related materials for our stores are shipped to our distribution centers in the Columbus, Ohio area. We use a variety of shipping terms that result in the transfer of title to the
merchandise at either the point of origin or point of destination.

Our policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventories on hand in our retail
stores and distribution centers to enable us to offer customers an appropriate selection of current merchandise. We emphasize rapid turnover and take markdowns as required to keep merchandise fresh and current.

Our operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: Spring (the first and second quarters) and Fall (the third and fourth quarters). The
fourth quarter, including the holiday season, accounted for approximately one-third of our net sales for 2008, 2007 and 2006 and is typically our most profitable quarter. Accordingly, cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as our
inventories build in advance of the holiday season.

We and our products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and international
regulatory authorities. We are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements.

Our trademarks and patents, which
constitute our primary intellectual property, have been registered or are the subject of pending applications in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law. We
believe our products and services are identified by our intellectual property and, thus, our intellectual property is of significant value. Accordingly, we intend to maintain our intellectual property and related registrations and vigorously protect
our intellectual property assets against infringement.

COMPETITION.

The sale of women’s intimate and other apparel, personal care and beauty products and accessories through retail stores is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors, including individual and chain
specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. Brand image, marketing, design, price, service, assortment and quality are the principal competitive factors in retail store sales. Our direct response businesses compete with numerous
national and regional direct response merchandisers. Image presentation, fulfillment and the factors affecting retail store sales discussed above are the principal competitive factors in direct response sales.


ASSOCIATE RELATIONS.

On January 31, 2009, we employed approximately 90,900 associates, 72,100 of whom were part-time. In addition, temporary associates are hired during peak periods, such as the holiday season.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

The following
discussion of risk factors contains “forward-looking statements,” as discussed in Item 1. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K, other filings or in any other discussions of our business.
The following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business,
financial condition or future results. The risks described below are not our only risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operating results
and/or financial condition in a material way.

Our revenue, profit results and cash flow are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, general
economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending patterns.

Our growth, sales and profitability may be adversely affected by negative local,
regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the
threat thereof.


Purchases of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market
conditions are unsettled or weak. In such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, which would further adversely affect our profitability and cash flow.

The current economic crisis has reduced consumer demand, which has adversely affected our results of operations and may continue to do so. Our financial performance in 2008 was significantly impacted by the global
economic downturn and its effect on the retail environment.

Further deterioration in economic conditions, along with increasing unemployment levels, may
continue to reduce the level of consumer spending and inhibit customers’ use of credit, which may continue to adversely affect our revenues and profits through reduced purchases of our products. In such circumstances, we may increase the number
of promotional sales, which would further adversely affect our profitability.

The global economic crisis could also impair the solvency of our
suppliers, customers and other counterparties.

There could be a number of additional effects from the ongoing economic downturn. The inability of key
suppliers to access liquidity, or the insolvency of key suppliers, could lead to delivery delays or failures. We provide merchandise sourcing services to other retailers and licensees and grant credit to these parties in the normal course of
business which subjects us to potential credit risk. Additionally, we have guaranteed the lease payments of certain of our former subsidiaries. Financial difficulties of our customers or those former subsidiaries for whom we guarantee lease payments
could adversely impact our results of operations. Finally, other counterparty failures, including banks and counterparties to contractual arrangements, could negatively impact our business.

The global economic crisis could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources.

Recently, the general economic and capital market conditions in the United States and other parts of the world have deteriorated significantly. These conditions have
adversely affected access to capital and increased the cost of capital. Although we believe that our capital structure and credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity through the credit crisis, there can be no assurance that our liquidity
will not be affected by these changes in the financial markets or that our capital resources will at all times be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs. If these conditions continue or become worse, our future cost of debt and equity capital and
access to the capital markets could be adversely affected.

Our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable
lease space.

Most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers. Sales at these stores are
derived, in part, from the high volume of traffic in those retail areas. Our stores benefit from the ability of the retail and other attractions in an area including “destination” retail and other attractions to generate consumer traffic
in the vicinity of our stores. Sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area, competition from other retail and non-retail attractions and other retail areas where we do not have stores.
Recently, sales volume and mall traffic has been adversely affected by the recessionary economic conditions.

Part of our future growth is significantly
dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. We cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available
at reasonable costs.

Our net sales, operating income and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis.

We experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth
quarter holiday season. Any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionate effect on our financial condition and results of operations.


Seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels, since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling
periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. We must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. If we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to
sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which in each case may further adversely affect profitability.

Our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions.

Our continued growth and success will
depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis. Accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including the
ability to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel, particularly at the store management level, and the integration of new stores into existing operations. There can be no
assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably. In addition, these goals
may be adversely affected by the current recessionary conditions.

Our plans for international expansion include risks that could materially adversely
impact our growth.

We intend to further expand into international markets. The risks associated with our expansion into international markets include
difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. In addition, we also have risks related to identifying
suitable partners for our international expansion. Further, entry into this market may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence. We cannot ensure the profitability of our
expansion into international markets. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our
licensees could take actions that could harm our business or brand images.

We have global representation through independently owned La Senza stores
operated by licensees. Although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective licensees, the amount of control we can exercise over our licensees is limited and the quality of licensed operations may be diminished by any number of factors
beyond our control. Licensees may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. Our
brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our licensees do not operate successfully.

Our direct channel business
includes risks that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results from operations.

Our direct operations are subject to
numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operational results. Risks include, but are not limited to the (a) diversion of sales from our stores, which may impact comparable store sales figures, (b) difficulty in
recreating the in-store experience through our direct channels, (c) domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and re-selling it overseas outside our control and (d) risks related to the failure of the systems that operate
the web sites and their related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. Any of these events could adversely affect our business.

Our failure to protect our reputation could have an adverse effect on our brand images.

Our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images. Our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality
and integrity. Any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental


standards for all of our operations and activities or adverse publicity regarding our responses to these concerns could also jeopardize our reputation.
Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer
confidence for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.

Our failure to adequately protect our trade names and trademarks could have a negative impact on our brand images and limit our ability to penetrate new markets.

We believe that our trade names and trademarks are an essential element of our strategy. We have obtained or applied for federal registration of these
trade names and trademarks and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries. There can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or
infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. If any third-party copies our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, our brand images could be materially adversely affected.

Our results can be adversely affected by market disruptions.

Market
disruptions due to severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards, terrorist activities or the prospect of these events can affect consumer spending and confidence levels and adversely affect our results or prospects in affected
markets. The receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to fully offset our losses.

Our stock price may be volatile.

Our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of quarter to quarter variations in our actual or
projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry. In addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that
have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies.

Our failure to maintain our credit rating could
negatively affect our ability to access capital and would increase our interest expense.

The credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital
structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations. We are dependent upon our ability to
access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. If our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest costs will likely increase, our financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be
adversely affected. Additionally, our failure to maintain our credit rating would result in higher interest costs under our existing debt terms.

We may
be unable to service our debt.

We may be unable to service our outstanding debt or any other debt we incur. Additionally, some of our debt related
agreements require maintenance of certain financial ratios which limit the total amount we may borrow and also prohibit certain types of liens on property or assets. If we violate the financial ratios associated with these debt agreements, we may be
required to accelerate repayment of this debt.


Our inability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could negatively impact
our results.

The sale of intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. We compete for sales with a broad
range of other retailers, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. In addition to the traditional store-based retailers, we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of
merchandise and who target customers through direct response channels. Brand image, marketing, design, price, service, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and direct response channels.

Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available. In many cases, our competitors sell their products in
department stores that are located in the same shopping malls as our stores. In addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls.

Increased competition could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations. The recent recessionary conditions have resulted in more significant competition and our competitors have lowered prices and engaged in more promotional activity.

Our inability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could negatively impact the image and relevance of our brands.

Our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and
to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings far in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. Customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly. If we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to
changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. In response, we may be forced to increase our
marketing promotions or price markdowns, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our brand image may also suffer if customers believe merchandise misjudgments indicate we are no longer able to
identify and offer the latest fashions.

We may be unable to retain key personnel.

It is our belief we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives, including Leslie H. Wexner (Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer). The loss of
the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. Competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit, train and
retain other qualified key personnel.

We may be unable to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and manage labor costs.

We believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive, engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained
and engaged employees. Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store personnel and talented merchants. The turnover rate in the retail industry is high and
qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. Competition for such qualified individuals could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of
employees. Our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand. Delayed store openings, significant increases in employee turnover
rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


We rely significantly on foreign sources
of production and maintenance of operations in foreign countries.

We purchase merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the domestic market. We do
not have any material long-term merchandise supply contracts. Many of our imports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or safeguard quotas. We compete
with other companies for production facilities.

We also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and
importing merchandise from abroad, such as:

•

political instability;

•

imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports;

•

legal and regulatory matters;

•

currency and exchange risks;

•

local business practice and political issues, including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards which may result in adverse
publicity;

•

potential delays or disruptions in shipping and related pricing impacts;

•

disruption of imports by labor disputes; and

•

changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation.

New initiatives may be proposed impacting the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which, if enacted, would limit or reduce the products purchased from
suppliers in such countries.

In addition, significant health hazards, environmental hazards or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative
effect on the economies, financial markets and business activity. Our purchase of merchandise from these manufacturing operations may be affected by this risk.

Our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and may have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner and meet quality standards.

We purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from third-party manufacturers. Similar to most other specialty retailers, we have narrow sales window periods for much of our inventory. Factors outside our
control, such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
and results of operations.

Our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in energy costs.

Energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past. These fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our
retail stores and costs to purchase product from our manufacturers. A continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We may be adversely impacted by increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing.

Postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings. We rely on
discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk


mailings and sorting. Future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to pass such increases directly onto our
customers or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems.

We self-insure certain risks and
may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience.

We are self-insured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical
benefits, workers’ compensation, property, general liability and automobile up to certain stop-loss limits. Claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile. Any adverse claims experience could result in future costs significantly in excess
of historical costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We significantly rely on our ability
to implement and sustain information technology systems.

Our success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information
technology systems. Our computer systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network
security measures, some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Additionally, these types of problems could result in a
breach of confidential customer information which could result in damage to our reputation and/or litigation. Despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems.
Sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
controls and reporting.

In addition, we are currently implementing modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for merchandise,
sourcing, distribution, e-commerce and support systems, including finance. Modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of
inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions. The launch of these successor systems will take place in a phased approach. Information technology system disruptions, if not
anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

We may fail to comply with regulatory requirements.

As a public company, we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. Our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all
applicable laws and regulations, including those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a
material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and on the market price of our common stock.

We may be subject to certain legal matters.

We are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks. Difficulty can exist in complying with sometimes conflicting regulations in local, national
or international jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations that affect how we operate. In addition, we may be impacted by litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders that could have a material
adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and on the market price of our common stock.

ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES.

The following table provides the location, use and size of our distribution, corporate and product development facilities as of
January 31, 2009:

United States

Our business for both the Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works segments is principally conducted from office, distribution and shipping facilities located in the Columbus, Ohio area. Additional facilities are located in New
York, New York; Kettering, Ohio; Rio Rancho, New Mexico and Paramus, New Jersey.

Our distribution and shipping facilities consist of seven buildings
located in the Columbus, Ohio area. These buildings, including attached office space, comprise approximately 6.4 million square feet.

As of
January 31, 2009, we operate 2,686 retail stores located in leased facilities, primarily in malls and shopping centers, throughout the United States. A substantial portion of these lease commitments consists of store leases generally with an
initial term of ten years. The leases expire at various dates between 2009 and 2024.

Typically, when space is leased for a retail store in a mall or
shopping center, we supply all improvements, including interior walls, floors, ceilings, fixtures and decorations. The cost of improvements varies widely, depending on the design, size and location of the store. In certain cases, the landlord of the
property may provide an allowance to fund all or a portion of the cost of improvements serving as a lease incentive. Rental terms for new locations usually include a fixed minimum rent plus a percentage of sales in excess of a specified amount. We
usually pay certain operating costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, insurance and taxes. For additional information, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data.

International

Canada

Our international business is principally conducted from owned and leased office, distribution and shipping facilities located in the Montreal, Quebec area. Additional

(a)

Fifty-three week fiscal year.

(b)

On January 29, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123(R)”), which requires the
measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date. For additional information, see Notes 2 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 123(R) was $0.7

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we changed our inventory valuation method. Previously, inventories were principally valued at the lower of cost or market, on a weighted-average
cost basis, using the retail method. Commencing in 2005, inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or market, on a weighted-average cost basis, using the cost method.

The cumulative effect of this change was $17 million, net of tax of $11 million. This change was recognized as an increase to net income in the
Consolidated Statement of Income as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2005. In addition to the $17 million cumulative impact recognized as of the beginning of the first quarter, the effect of the change during 2005 was to decrease net income
by $4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATION.

The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Our operating results are generally impacted by changes in the U.S. and Canadian economies and,
therefore, we monitor the retail environment using, among other things, certain key industry performance indicators such as the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (which measures consumers’ views on the future course of the U.S.
economy), the National Retail Traffic Index (which measures traffic levels in malls nationwide) and National Retail Sales (which reflects sales volumes of 5,000 businesses as measured by the U.S. Census Bureau). These indices provide insight into
consumer spending patterns and shopping behavior in the current retail environment and assist us in assessing our performance as well as the potential impact of industry trends on our future operating results. Additionally, we evaluate a number of
key performance indicators including comparable store sales, gross profit, operating income and other performance metrics such as sales per average selling square foot and inventory per selling square foot in assessing our performance.

Executive Overview

Strategy

Our strategy supports and drives our mission to build a family of the world’s best fashion retail brands whose well-told stories create loyal customers and
deliver sustained growth for our stakeholders.

To execute our strategy, we are focused on these key strategic imperatives:

•

Grow our core brands in current channels and geographies;

•

Extend our core brands into larger footprints and new channels and geographies;

•

Incubate and grow new brands in current channels;

•

Build enabling infrastructure and capabilities;

•

Become the top destination for talent; and

•

Optimize our capital structure.

2008 Overview

We anticipated that the retail environment would be challenging in 2008. However, the holiday season was much more difficult than expected as a result
of the global economic downturn and its impact on the U.S. and Canadian retail environment. Our financial performance in 2008 was significantly impacted by the downturn. Our net sales decreased 11% to $9.043 billion, driven by a comparable store
sales decrease of 9%, and our operating income decreased $521 million to $589 million. The decline in our operating income included a $215 million impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets related to our La Senza business. For additional
information related to our 2008 financial performance, see “Results of Operations—2008 Compared to 2007.”

As a result of these challenges,
we focused on the conservative management of retail fundamentals including:

•

Inventory levels—we ended 2008 down 6% and 33% as compared to 2007 and 2006, respectively, and our inventory per selling square foot ended 2008 down 8% and 34%
compared to 2007 and 2006, respectively;

•

Operating expenses—we have taken actions to reduce our expense base including reducing our home office headcount by approximately 10% during the second quarter
of 2007 and an additional 10% during the fourth quarter of 2008;


•

Capital expenditures—we reduced our capital expenditures from $749 million in 2007 to $479 million in 2008. We are currently planning capital expenditures of
approximately $200 million in 2009;

•

Cash and liquidity—we generated cash flow from operations of $954 million in 2008 and ended 2008 with $1.2 billion in cash. Additionally, in February 2009, we
renegotiated the covenants on our $750 million term loan and $1 billion revolving credit facility to provide us additional flexibility in this uncertain environment.

Despite the challenging environment during 2008, we accomplished the following in terms of the execution of our business strategy:

•

The stabilization of operations in our new distribution center for Victoria’s Secret Direct;

•

The divestiture of a personal care joint venture in the first quarter of 2008 which generated pre-tax cash proceeds of $159 million and a pre-tax gain of $128
million;

•

The successful introduction of Bath & Body Works stores into Canada; and

•

The implementation of our new supply chain systems at Mast.

2009 Outlook

Economic Environment

The global retail sector and our business continue to face a very uncertain and difficult environment and, as a result, we have taken a defensive stance in terms of the financial management of our business. We will continue to manage our
business conservatively and we will focus on the execution of the retail fundamentals noted above.

At the same time, we are aggressively focusing on
bringing compelling merchandise assortments, marketing and store experiences to our customers. We will look for, and capitalize on, those opportunities available to us in this difficult environment. We believe that our brands, which lead their
categories and offer high emotional content at accessible prices, are well positioned heading into 2009.

International Expansion

We anticipate opening approximately 20 new Bath & Body Works Canada stores in 2009. The six stores that we opened in 2008 have exceeded our performance
expectations. Additionally, we will continue to explore other international opportunities in 2009.

Capital Expenditures

We plan to spend approximately $200 million in 2009 on capital expenditures with the majority relating to opening new stores and remodeling and improving existing stores.
We expect to open approximately 50 new stores in the U.S. and Canada and to remodel approximately 40 stores during 2009.

For 2008, our net sales decreased 11% to
$9.043 billion and comparable store sales decreased 9%. The decrease in our net sales was primarily driven by the following:

Victoria’s Secret

For 2008, net sales remained relatively flat at $5.604 billion and comparable store sales decreased 8%. The net sales result was primarily driven
by:

•

At Victoria’s Secret Direct, net sales increased 9% driven by strong performance in certain categories including swimwear and dresses and the impact of the
2007 operational issues at the new distribution center;

•

At La Senza, net sales increased slightly due to increased net sales to international licensees and new store growth mostly offset by unfavorable currency
fluctuations;

Partially offset by:

•

At Victoria’s Secret Stores, net sales decreased across many categories primarily driven by a merchandise assortment that did not overcome the challenging
economic environment and initial recognition of gift card breakage of $48 million in 2007. The declines were partially offset by growth related to new and expanded stores and an increase in Pink.

The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by declines in store traffic and transactions in addition to decreased units per sales transaction.

Bath & Body Works

For 2008, net sales
decreased 5% to $2.374 billion and comparable store sales decreased 9%. Net sales decreased driven by weak store traffic and the challenging economic environment. From a category perspective, declines in Signature Collection were offset partially by
increases in the Aromatherapy, True Blue Spa and home fragrance categories. The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by declines in store traffic and lower average unit retail prices offset partially by an increase in merchandise
units per transaction.

Apparel and Other

For
2008, Apparel net sales decreased $870 million as a result of the 2007 divestitures of 75% of our equity interests in Express and Limited Stores. In addition, Other net sales decreased $98 million to $1.065 billion primarily driven by a decrease in
Mast sales as well as the personal care joint venture that was sold in the first quarter of 2008.

Gross Profit

For 2008, our gross profit decreased 14% to $3.006 billion and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 33.2% from 34.6% primarily
driven by the following:

Victoria’s Secret

For 2008, gross profit decreased primarily driven by the decrease at Victoria’s Secret Stores in net sales and the related decrease in merchandise margin dollars combined with increased buying and occupancy expenses related to our new
and remodeled stores.

Victoria’s Secret Direct’s gross profit remained relatively flat as the impact of the 9% increase in net sales was offset
by the impact of increased promotional activity to clear inventory and an increase in catalogue circulation.

The gross profit rate decreased driven
primarily by an increase in the buying and occupancy expense rate as cited above.


Bath & Body Works

For 2008, gross profit decreased primarily driven by lower net sales and a related decrease in merchandise margin dollars combined with an increase in buying and occupancy expenses associated with store real estate
activity.

The gross profit rate decreased driven primarily by an increase in the buying and occupancy expense rate due to the factors cited above.

Apparel and Other

For 2008, gross profit
decreased $250 million as a result of the divestitures of 75% equity interest in Express and Limited Stores in 2007.

General, Administrative and Store
Operating Expenses

For 2008, our general, administrative and store operating expenses decreased 12% to $2.311 billion primarily driven by:

•

the Apparel divestitures in the second quarter of 2007;

•

the elimination of costs related to the technology joint venture that was closed in December 2007;

•

the elimination of costs related to the personal care joint venture that was sold in the first quarter of 2008; and

•

expense reductions across all segments, primarily in home office costs.

Partially offset by:

•

gains of $25 million related to the sale of corporate aircraft in 2007.

The general, administrative and store operating expense rate decreased to 25.6% from 25.8% primarily driven by the factors cited above.

Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized charges totaling
$215 million related to the impairment of goodwill and trade name assets associated with our La Senza business. The impairment charges were based on our evaluation of the estimated fair value of the La Senza business and trade name assets as
compared to their respective carrying values. Our evaluation concluded that as a result of the global economic downturn and the related negative impact on La Senza’s operating performance, the fair value of the La Senza business and trade name
assets were below their carrying values as of the fourth quarter of 2008. For additional information, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplemental Data.

Net Gain on Joint Ventures

In
April 2008, we and our investment partner completed the divestiture of a personal care joint venture to a third party. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $128 million on the divestiture. The pre-tax gain is included in Net Gain on Joint Ventures on the
2008 Consolidated Statement of Income. In addition, we recorded a $19 million impairment charge related to another joint venture. The charge consisted of writing down the investment balance, reserving certain accounts and notes receivable and
accruing a contractual liability. The impairment of $19 million is also included in Net Gain on Joint Ventures on the 2008 Consolidated Statement of Income.


Apparel Divestitures

On July 6, 2007, we finalized the divestiture of a 75% ownership interest in our Express brand to affiliates of Golden Gate Capital for pre-tax net cash proceeds of
$547 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain on divestiture of $302 million.

On August 3, 2007, we divested a 75% ownership interest of
our Limited Stores business to affiliates of Sun Capital Partners. As part of the transaction, Sun Capital contributed $50 million of equity capital into the business and arranged for a $75 million credit facility. We received no cash proceeds from
the transaction and recorded a pre-tax loss of $72 million on the transaction.

For 2008, interest expense increased $32 million to $181 million. The increase was primarily driven by an increase
in average borrowings and an increase in fees related to our credit facilities partially offset by a decrease in the average borrowing rate.

Interest
Income

For 2008, our interest income remained flat at $18 million as the impact of higher average invested cash balances was offset by a decrease in
average effective interest rates.

Other Income (Loss)

For 2008, other income (loss) decreased $105 million to $23 million due to a 2007 gain of $100 million related to a distribution from Easton Town Center, LLC and net gains of $17 million from the settlement of interest rate lock agreements
in 2007. The other income decrease was partially offset by a $71 million cash distribution from Express which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $13 million in 2008.

Minority Interest

For 2008, minority interest decreased $18 million to $4 million. Minority interest represents the proportional share of
net income or losses of consolidated, less than wholly owned subsidiaries attributable to the minority interest investor. The decrease is a result of the divestiture of a personal care joint venture in first quarter of 2008 and the closure of a
technology joint venture in December 2007.

Provision for Income Taxes

For 2008, our effective tax rate increased to 51.5% from 36.4%. The increase in the rate resulted primarily from the 2008 impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets at La Senza, which is not deductible for
income tax purposes.

For the fourth quarter of 2008, our net sales decreased 9% to $2.991 billion and comparable store sales decreased
10%. The decrease in our net sales was primarily driven by the following:

Victoria’s Secret

For the fourth quarter of 2008, net sales decreased 7% to $1.767 billion and comparable store sales decreased 10%. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by:

•

At Victoria’s Secret Stores, net sales decreased across most categories primarily driven by a merchandise assortment that did not overcome the challenging
economic environment and the initial recognition of gift card breakage of $48 million in 2007. The declines were partially offset by growth related to new and expanded stores as well as an increase in Pink;

•

At La Senza, net sales decreased due to unfavorable currency fluctuations and a merchandise assortment that did not overcome the challenging economic environment;

Partially offset by:

•

At Victoria’s Secret Direct, although sales were below our expectations due to the challenging economic environment, net sales increased 4% as we anniversaried
the 2007 operational issues at the new distribution center which negatively impacted net sales in 2007.

The decrease in comparable store
sales was primarily driven by declines in store traffic and lower average unit retail prices offset partially by an increase in merchandise units per transaction.


Bath & Body Works

For the fourth quarter of 2008, net sales decreased 8% to $998 million and comparable store sales decreased 11%. Net sales decreased across most merchandise categories as a result of the challenging economic
environment.

The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by lower average unit retail prices and declines in store traffic.

Other

For the fourth quarter of 2008, net sales decreased 25%
to $226 million. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by a decrease in Mast sales as well as the personal care joint venture that was sold in the first quarter of 2008.

Gross Profit

For the fourth quarter of 2008, our gross profit decreased 21% to $1.024 billion and our gross profit
rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 34.3% from 39.6% primarily driven by the following:

Victoria’s Secret

For the fourth quarter of 2008, gross profit decreased primarily driven by:

•

At Victoria’s Secret Stores, gross profit decreased significantly driven by lower merchandise margin dollars as a result of the decline in net sales, including
the impact of the initial recognition of gift card breakage in 2007, and increased promotional activity to drive sales and clear inventory. In addition, buying and occupancy expenses increased as a result of investment in our new and remodeled
stores.

•

At Victoria’s Secret Direct, gross profit decreased as a result of a decline in merchandise margin associated with increased promotional activity.
Additionally, buying and occupancy expenses increased due to higher catalogue circulation;

•

At La Senza, gross profit decreased driven by a decrease in merchandise margin due to unfavorable currency fluctuations and a comparable store sales decrease of
10%.

The decrease in the gross profit rate was driven primarily by a decrease in the merchandise margin rate and an increase in the
buying and occupancy expense rate due to the factors cited above.

Bath & Body Works

For the fourth quarter of 2008, gross profit decreased primarily driven by lower merchandise margin dollars as a result of a decline in net sales and an increase in
promotional activity to drive sales and clear inventory. In addition, buying and occupancy expenses increased as a result of our store real estate activity.

The decrease in the gross profit rate was driven by a decrease in the merchandise margin rate and an increase in the buying and occupancy rate due to the factors cited above.

a restructuring charge of $23 million consisting of severance and related costs in the fourth quarter of 2008.

The general, administrative and store operating expense rate increased to 21.9% from 20.6% primarily driven by the overall decline in sales during the fourth quarter of
2008.

Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized charges totaling $215 million related to the impairment of goodwill and trade name assets associated with our La Senza business. The impairment charges were based on our evaluation of the
estimated fair value of the La Senza business and trade name assets as compared to their respective carrying values. Our evaluation concluded that as a result of the global economic downturn and the related negative impact on La Senza’s
operating performance, the fair value of the La Senza business and trade name assets were below their carrying values as of the fourth quarter of 2008. For additional information, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.

For the fourth quarter of 2008, our interest expense decreased $1 million to $45 million. The decrease was
primarily driven by a decrease in average borrowings and average borrowing rates offset partially by an increase in fees related to our credit facilities.

Interest Income

For the fourth quarter of 2008, our interest income decreased $4 million to $2 million. The decrease was primarily driven
by a decrease in average effective interest rates which was the result of our investment portfolio shift to U.S. government-backed securities.

Other
Income (Loss)

For the fourth quarter of 2008, our other income decreased $10 million to $0. The decrease was primarily driven by lower income from our
equity investment in Express. We divested 75% of our equity interest in Express in July 2007 and retained the remaining 25% as an equity method investment

.

Provision for Income Taxes

For the fourth quarter of 2008, our effective tax rate increased to 85.4% from 34.2%. The increase in the rate
resulted primarily from the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets at La Senza, which is not deductible for income tax purposes.

The following table compares 2007 comparable store sales to 2006:

(a)

Reflects comparable store sales prior to the divestitures of Express and Limited Stores in July 2007 and August 2007, respectively.

For 2007, our net sales decreased 5% to $10.134 billion and comparable store sales decreased 2%. The decrease in our net sales was primarily driven by the following:

Victoria’s Secret

For 2007, net sales
increased 9% to $5.607 billion and comparable store sales decreased 2%. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the inclusion of La Senza net sales for the full year in 2007. The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by
decreases across most categories, including core lingerie and beauty offset by modest increases in the Pink sub-brand and sleepwear. The decreases resulted from product assortment misses and a merchandise assortment that did not overcome the
challenging economic environment in 2007.

Bath & Body Works

For 2007, net sales decreased 2% to $2.494 billion and comparable store sales decreased 4%. The decrease in net sales and comparable store sales was primarily driven by declines in store traffic experienced throughout
the year and, in particular, during the fourth quarter which resulted in disappointing holiday and semi-annual sale performance.

Apparel

For 2007, net sales decreased 61% to $870 million as a result of the divestitures of Express and Limited Stores in the second quarter of 2007. Prior to the
divestitures, comparable store sales increased 5%.


Other

For
2007, net sales increased by 58% to $1.163 billion primarily driven by an increase in third-party customer sales at Mast due to the divestitures of Express and Limited Stores during the second quarter of 2007. Subsequent to the divestitures, 75% of
Mast sales to Express and Limited Stores are included in third-party customer sales while the remaining 25% are eliminated consistent with our ownership interest.

Gross Profit

For 2007, our gross profit decreased 13% to $3.509 billion and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales)
decreased to 34.6% from 37.6% primarily driven by the following:

Victoria’s Secret

For 2007, gross profit decreased primarily driven by the following:

•

A decrease in gross profit at Victoria’s Secret Stores driven primarily by increases in buying and occupancy expenses related to real estate expansion
activities; and

•

A decrease in gross profit at Victoria’s Secret Direct driven primarily by the operational limitations affecting the new distribution center;

Partially offset by:

•

Inclusion of La Senza’s gross profit for the full year in 2007.

The gross profit rate decreased driven primarily by deleverage of buying and occupancy expenses and a decline in the merchandise margin rate associated with promotional activities and markdowns on certain categories
in response to soft sales trends.

Bath & Body Works

For 2007, gross profit decreased primarily driven by the decline in net sales. The gross profit rate decreased driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotional activities designed to
drive traffic.

Apparel

For 2007, gross profit
decreased as a result of the divestitures of Express and Limited Stores in the second quarter of 2007.

General, Administrative and Store Operating
Expenses

For 2007, our general, administrative and store operating expenses decreased 8% to $2.616 billion primarily driven by the Apparel divestiture,
cost reductions realized in the second half of the year associated with our second quarter restructuring program and gains from the sale of corporate aircraft. These decreases were partially offset by the charges recognized primarily in the second
quarter of 2007 related to the restructuring program, increased costs at Victoria’s Secret Direct related to the new distribution center and the inclusion of La Senza’s general, administrative and store operating expenses for the full year
in 2007. The general, administrative and store operating expense rate decreased to 25.8% from 26.6% primarily driven by the net impact of the Apparel divestiture, including the recognition of Mast net sales to Express and Limited Stores.

For 2007, interest expense increased $47 million to $149 million. The increase was primarily driven by an increase
in average borrowings and average borrowing rates resulting from the issuance of $1.0 billion of notes and borrowing an additional $250 million under our amended term loan during the second quarter of 2007.

Interest Income

For 2007, interest income decreased $7 million to
$18 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in average invested cash balances.

Other Income (Loss)

For 2007, other income (loss) increased $131 million to $128 million. The increase was primarily driven by a $100 million gain related to a distribution from Easton Town
Center, LLC (“ETC”), in which we have an equity investment, and income from our equity investment in Express. In July 2007, ETC refinanced its existing bank loan and distributed cash proceeds of $150 million to its members. As an ETC
member, we received approximately $102 million of proceeds resulting in a $100 million gain after reducing our ETC carrying value from $2 million to zero. In addition, we had a net gain of $17 million from the settlement of interest rate lock
agreements.

Minority Interest

For 2007, minority
interest increased $21 million to $22 million. Minority interest represents the proportional share of net income or losses of consolidated, less than wholly owned subsidiaries attributable to the minority interest investor. The increase relates to
losses from a personal care joint venture acquired during the first quarter of 2007 and losses from an investment in an independent technology company focused on large multi-channel retailers.

Provision for Income Taxes

For 2007, our effective tax rate
decreased to 36.4% from 38.5%. The decline in the rate is primarily due to the reversal of state net operating loss carryforward valuation allowances in conjunction with the Apparel divestitures in the second quarter of 2007, a decline in the
Canadian federal tax rate, audit settlements and other items.

For the fourth quarter of 2007, our net sales decreased 19% to $3.276 billion and comparable store sales decreased 8%. The decrease in our net sales was primarily driven by the following:

Victoria’s Secret

For the fourth quarter of 2007, net
sales increased 2% to $1.893 billion and comparable store sales decreased 8%. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by:

•

Inclusion of La Senza’s net sales for the full quarter in 2007; and

•

Initial recognition of gift card breakage at Victoria’s Secret of $48 million;

Offset partially by:

•

A decrease at Victoria’s Secret Direct as a result of the actions we undertook to constrain customer orders due to the operational issues associated with the
new distribution center; and

•

A decrease at Victoria’s Secret Stores primarily related to the 53

rd

week included in 2006 results and a merchandise assortment that did not overcome the challenging economic environment in 2007.

The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by decreases across most categories, including core lingerie and beauty, offset by modest increases in the
Pink sub-brand and sleepwear. The decreases resulted from product assortment misses and a merchandise assortment that did not overcome the challenging economic environment during the fourth quarter of 2007.


Bath & Body Works

For the fourth quarter of 2007, net sales decreased 8% to $1.080 billion and comparable store sales decreased 8%. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by:

•

Softness in mall traffic and the overall economic environment;

•

A lack of newness in product assortment; and

•

Prolonged holiday discounting that negatively affected the performance of the semi-annual sale.

Other

For the fourth quarter of 2007, net sales increased 25%
to $303 million primarily driven by an increase in third-party customer sales at Mast due to the divestitures of Express and Limited Stores during the second quarter of 2007. Subsequent to the divestitures, 75% of Mast sales to Express and Limited
Stores are included in third-party customer sales while the remaining 25% are eliminated in consolidation consistent with our ownership interest.

Profit

For the fourth quarter of 2007, our gross profit decreased 20% to $1.296 billion and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net
sales) decreased to 39.6% from 40.1% primarily driven by the following:

Victoria’s Secret

For the fourth quarter of 2007, gross profit decreased primarily driven by:

•

A decrease in merchandise margin at Victoria’s Secret Direct due to the actions we undertook to constrain customer orders; and

•

A decrease in merchandise margin associated with decreased net sales at Victoria’s Secret Stores and increased buying and occupancy expenses associated with
the real estate expansion activities;

Offset partially by:

•

Initial recognition of gift card breakage of $48 million; and

•

Inclusion of La Senza’s gross profit for the full quarter in 2007.

The gross profit rate decreased driven primarily by deleverage of buying and occupancy expenses due to the Victoria’s Secret Stores real estate expansion activities and inclusion of La Senza’s results for
the full quarter in 2007.

Bath & Body Works

For the fourth quarter of 2007, gross profit decreased primarily driven by lower net sales. The gross profit rate decreased driven by a modest decline in the merchandise margin rate related to promotional activity to clear seasonal
merchandise and deleverage in the buying and occupancy expense rate associated with the decline in net sales.

General, Administrative and Store
Operating Expenses

For the fourth quarter of 2007, our general, administrative and store operating expenses decreased 24% to $675 million primarily
driven by the Apparel divestitures. The general, administrative and store operating expense rate decreased to 20.6% from 22.0% primarily driven by the net impact of the Apparel divestitures, including the recognition of Mast net sales to Express and
Limited Stores. The rate also benefited from the initial recognition of gift card breakage at Victoria’s Secret and lower incentive compensation and marketing expense.

Interest Income

For the fourth quarter of 2007, our
interest income increased $2 million to $6 million. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in average invested cash balances partially offset by a decrease in average effective interest rates.

Other Income (Loss)

For the fourth quarter of 2007, our other income
(loss) increased $9 million to $10 million. The increase was primarily driven by income from our equity investment in Express. We divested 75% of Express in July 2007 and retained the remaining 25% as an equity method investment.

Provision for Income Taxes

For the fourth quarter of 2007, our
effective tax rate decreased to 34.2% from 37.7%. The decline in the rate resulted from a decline in the Canadian federal tax rate, the finalization of income taxes related to the Apparel divestitures, audit settlements and other items.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining our financial stability. We are committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. Cash
generated from our operating activities provides the primary resources to support current operations, growth initiatives, seasonal funding requirements and capital expenditures. Our cash provided from operations is impacted by working capital
changes and our net income. Our net income is impacted by, among other things, sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, timing of new product introductions and profit margins. Historically, sales are higher during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, our need for working capital peaks during the summer and fall months as inventory builds in anticipation of the holiday period.

As of January 31, 2009, we had total revolving credit facilities of $1.3 billion including a $1 billion, 5-year facility that expires in August 2012 (the
“5-Year Facility”) and a $300 million, 364-day facility that was set to expire in July 2009 (the “364-Day Facility”). The facilities contain fixed charge coverage and leverage covenants that may limit the availability of the
facilities. Both facilities support our commercial paper and letter of credit programs. We did not borrow under either of the facilities in 2008.


On February 19, 2009, we amended the 5-Year Facility and the $750 million term loan maturing in August 2012
(“Term Loan”) and we canceled the 364-Day Facility after determining it was no longer required. The amendment to the 5-Year Facility and the Term Loan includes changes to both the fixed charge coverage and leverage covenants which provide
additional flexibility. Under the amended covenants, we are required to maintain the fixed charge coverage ratio at 1.60 or above through fiscal year 2010 and 1.75 or above thereafter. The leverage ratio, which is debt compared to EBITDA, as those
terms are defined in the agreement, must not exceed 5.0 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, 4.5 from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 and 4.0 thereafter. The amendment also increases the
interest costs and fees associated with the 5-Year Facility and the Term Loan, provides for certain security interests as defined in the agreement and limits dividends, share repurchases and other restricted payments as defined in the agreement to
$220 million per year with certain potential increases as defined in the agreement. The interest rate as of January 31, 2009 on the Term Loan would have been 6.69% had the amendment been effective at that date. The amendment does not impact the
maturity dates of either the 5-Year Facility or the Term Loan.

The U.S. retail sector and our business have faced a very difficult environment during most
of 2008 and into 2009. However, we believe that available short-term and long-term capital resources are sufficient to fund foreseeable requirements.

following table provides a summary of our working capital position and capitalization as of January 31, 2009, February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007:

In December 2008, Standard and Poor’s (“S&P”) downgraded our Corporate and Senior Unsecured Debt ratings from an investment grade rating of BBB- to a speculative
grade rating of BB+. In addition, S&P changed their rating outlook to stable from negative.

Our borrowing costs and certain other
provisions under our Term Loan and revolving credit facilities are linked to our credit ratings. As a result of the Moody’s and S&P downgrades, our borrowing costs under our term loan and revolving credit facilities increased in the fourth
quarter of 2008. The impact of this increase was not material to our earnings and cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2008. The Moody’s or S&P downgrades did not accelerate the repayment of any of our debt.

The downgrades by the rating agencies in February 2009 will further increase our borrowing costs in 2009.

If we receive an
additional downgrade in our credit ratings by any agencies listed above, the availability of additional credit could be negatively affected. Credit rating downgrades by any of the agencies do not accelerate the repayment of any of our debt.

Common Stock Share Repurchases

In October 2008, our
Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase $250 million of our outstanding common stock. During November 2008, we repurchased 5.0 million shares of our common stock for $43 million at an average price per share of approximately
$8.64. Through March 20, 2009, no additional shares were repurchased.

Dividend Policy and Procedures

We currently pay a common stock dividend of $0.15 per share in cash each quarter. Our Board of Directors will determine future dividends after giving consideration to our
levels of profit and cash flow, capital requirements, current and forecasted liquidity, the restrictions placed upon us by our borrowing arrangements as well as financial and other business conditions existing at the time.


Cash Flow

The
following table provides a summary of our cash flow activity for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2009, February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007:

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was $954 million. Net income of $220 million included (a) $343 million of depreciation and amortization, (b) a $215 million impairment of goodwill and other
intangible assets and (c) a $109 million net gain on joint ventures. Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant working capital
change was a $103 million increase in operating cash flow associated with accounts receivable due primarily to reduced sourcing and other transition services billings to Express and Limited Stores.

Net cash provided by operating activities in 2007 was $765 million consisting primarily of net income of $718 million. Net income included (a) $352 million of
depreciation and amortization, (b) the $302 million gain on divestiture of Express, and (c) the $100 million gain on distribution from Easton Town Center, LLC. Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current
period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant working capital change was a $337 million increase in operating cash flow associated with inventories. Inventory levels decreased compared to 2006 due to a concerted
effort to control and reduce inventory levels across the enterprise and due to reductions in safety stocks at Bath & Body Works that increased during 2006 in connection with the 2006 supply chain system conversion. Accounts receivable
increased due to the Apparel divestitures, which caused Mast’s accounts receivable from Express and Limited Stores to be recognized as third-party receivables on our balance sheet.

Net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was $600 million consisting primarily of net income of $676 million. Net income included $316 million of depreciation and amortization. Other changes in assets and
liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant working capital change was a $545 million decrease in operating cash flow associated with inventories. We increased
inventory levels during the year to meet the following objectives: (a) at Victoria’s Secret, increases related to new product launches in core lingerie and beauty, initiatives to increase market share and build brand loyalty and an
initiative to improve in-stock inventory positions and (b) at Bath & Body Works, increases related primarily to investments in safety stocks of seasonless basics in anticipation of the supply chain system conversion that occurred
mid-year as well as an initiative to improve in-stock inventory positions.

Investing Activities

Net cash used for investing activities in 2008 was $240 million consisting primarily of $479 million of capital expenditures offset by $159 million from the divestiture
of a joint venture and $95 million from returns of capital from Express. The capital expenditures included $345 million for opening new stores and remodeling and improving existing stores. Remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to
spending on technology and infrastructure to support growth.


Net cash provided by investing activities in
2007 was $30 million consisting primarily of (a) $547 million of proceeds from the divestiture of Express, (b) $102 million of proceeds from a distribution from Easton Town Center, LLC, and (c) $97 million of proceeds related to the
sale of assets, offset by $749 million of capital expenditures. The capital expenditures included $476 million for opening new stores and remodeling and improving existing stores. Remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to investments
in our new distribution center and increased spending on home office, technology and infrastructure.

Net cash used for investing activities in 2006 was
$1.093 billion consisting primarily of $572 million related to the acquisition of La Senza and $548 million of capital expenditures. The capital expenditures included $311 million for opening new stores and remodeling and improving existing stores.
Remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to investments in new growth concepts and increased spending on technology and infrastructure to support growth.

We anticipate spending approximately $200 million for capital expenditures in 2009 with the majority relating to opening new stores and remodeling and improving existing stores. We expect to open approximately 50 new
stores in the U.S. and Canada and to close approximately 70 stores. Our new stores will be primarily Bath & Body Works and Victoria’s Secret.

Financing Activities

Net cash used for financing activities in 2008 was $562 million consisting primarily of (a) cash payments
of $379 million related to the repurchase of 28 million shares of common stock during the year at a weighted-average price of $13.36 under our November 2007 and October 2008 share repurchase programs and (b) quarterly dividend payments of
$0.15 per share, or $201 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by the exercise of stock options of $31 million.

Net cash used for financing
activities in 2007 was $279 million consisting primarily of (a) cash payments of $1.4 billion related to the repurchase of 59 million shares of common stock during the year at a weighted-average price of $24.01 under our June
2006, June 2007, August 2007 and November 2007 share repurchase programs and (b) quarterly dividend payments of $0.15 per share, or $227 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by (a) debt offering proceeds of $997
million, (b) proceeds from the term loan refinancing of $250 million and (c) the exercise of stock options of $74 million.

Net cash used for
financing activities in 2006 was $215 million consisting primarily of (a) cash payments of $193 million related to the repurchase of 8 million shares of common stock during the year at a weighted-average price of $24.98 under our November
2005, February 2006 and June 2006 share repurchase programs and (b) quarterly dividend payments of $0.15 per share, or $238 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $153 million
and excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $46 million.

Contingent Liabilities and Contractual Obligations

The following table provides our contractual obligations, aggregated by type, including the maturity profile as of January 31, 2009:


(a)

Long-term debt obligations relate to our principal and interest payments for outstanding notes, debentures, Term Loan and line of credit borrowings. Interest payments have been
estimated based on the coupon rate for fixed rate obligations and the variable rate, including the impact of the participating interest rate swap arrangement, in effect as of January 31, 2009 for the Term Loan. Interest obligations exclude
amounts which have been accrued through January 31, 2009. For additional information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

(b)

Operating lease obligations primarily represent minimum payments due under store lease agreements. For additional information, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

(c)

Purchase obligations primarily include purchase orders for merchandise inventory and other agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that
specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.

(d)

Other liabilities primarily includes future payments relating to our nonqualified supplemental retirement plan and have been reflected under “Other” as the timing of these
future payments is not known until an associate leaves the company or otherwise requests an in-service distribution. In addition, Other Liabilities also includes future estimated payments associated with unrecognized tax benefits as accounted for
under Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

. The “Less Than 1 Year” category includes $14 million because it is reasonably possible that the payments could change in the
next twelve months due to audit settlements of resolution or uncertainties. The remaining portion is included in the “Other” category as the timing and amount of these payments is not known until the matters are resolved with relevant tax
authorities. For additional information, see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

In connection with the disposition of certain businesses, we have remaining guarantees of approximately $194 million related to lease payments of Express, Limited Stores, Abercrombie & Fitch, Tween Brands
(formerly Limited Too and Too, Inc.), Dick’s Sporting Goods (formerly Galyan’s), Lane Bryant, New York & Company and Anne.x under the current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through 2019. These guarantees
include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of the businesses. In certain instances, our guarantee may remain in effect if the
term of a lease is extended.

The following table details the guaranteed lease payments during the next five fiscal years and the remaining years
thereafter:

In April 2008, we received an irrevocable standby letter of credit from Express of $34 million issued by a
third-party bank to mitigate a portion of our contingent liability for guaranteed future lease payments of Express. We can draw from the irrevocable standby letter of credit if Express were to default on any of the guaranteed leases. The irrevocable
standby letter of credit is reduced through September 30, 2010, the expiration date of the letter of credit, consistent with the overall reduction in guaranteed lease payments. The outstanding balance of the irrevocable standby letter of credit
from Express was $19 million as of January 31, 2009.


Our guarantees related to Express, Limited
Stores and New York & Company are subject to the provisions of SFAS 145,

Rescission, Amendment and Technical Correction of Certain Accounting Standards,

which requires fair value accounting for these guarantee obligations. The
guaranteed lease payments related to Express (net of the irrevocable standby letter of credit), Limited Stores and New York & Company totaled $94 million and $180 million as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively.
The estimated fair value of these guarantee obligations was $15 million and $10 million as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively, and is included in Other Long-term Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
increase in the fair value from February 2, 2008 to January 31, 2009 reflects the impact of the current economic environment and our assessment of the risk of default on the guaranteed lease payments.

Our guarantees related to Abercrombie & Fitch, Tween Brands (formerly Limited Too and Too, Inc.), Dick’s Sporting Goods (formerly Galyan’s), Lane
Bryant and Anne.x are not subject to the fair value provisions of SFAS 145 because they were executed prior to the effective date of SFAS 145. These guarantees are subject to the provisions of SFAS 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

, which
requires that a loss be accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. As of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, we had no liability recorded with respect to any of the guarantee obligations subject to SFAS 5 as we concluded that
performance under these guarantees was not probable.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation 229.303 Item 303 (a) (4).

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (“SFAS 161”)

In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS 161, which requires disclosures about the fair value of derivative instruments and
their gains or losses in tabular format as well as disclosures regarding credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements, counterparty credit risk and strategies and objectives for using derivative instruments. SFAS 161 amends and
expands SFAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, and is effective prospectively beginning in 2009. Adoption of SFAS 161 will impact our disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities beginning
in 2009.

SFAS 141, (revised 2007) Business Combinations (“SFAS 141(R)”)

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141(R), which establishes how the acquiring entity recognizes and measures the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any gain on bargain purchases and any noncontrolling interest
in the acquired entity. SFAS 141(R) requires acquisition-related costs to be expensed in the periods they are incurred, with the exception of the costs to issue debt or equity securities. SFAS 141(R) requires disclosure of information for a business
combination that occurs during the accounting period or prior to the issuance of the financial statements for the accounting period. SFAS 141(R) is effective prospectively for business combinations with an acquisition date on or after the beginning
of the first annual reporting period after December 15, 2008. Adoption of SFAS 141(R) is not expected to have an impact to our financial statements.

SFAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (“SFAS 160”)

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160,
which modifies reporting for noncontrolling interest (minority interest) in consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 requires noncontrolling interest be reported in equity and establishes a new framework for recognizing net income or loss and
comprehensive income by the controlling interest. SFAS 160 requires specific disclosures regarding changes in equity interest of both the controlling and noncontrolling parties and presentation of the noncontrolling equity balance and income or loss
for all periods presented. SFAS 160 is effective for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The statement is applied prospectively upon adoption. Upon adoption, prior period financial statements will be
restated for the presentation of the noncontrolling interest for comparability. Adoption of SFAS 160 will impact the presentation of noncontrolling interests in our financial statements beginning in 2009.


SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“SFAS 159”)

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159 permitting entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard also
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparison between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. If the fair value option is elected, the effect of the
first remeasurement to fair value is reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The statement is applied prospectively upon adoption. We did not adopt fair value treatment for any assets or liabilities
under SFAS 159 as of the beginning of 2008.

SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS 157”)

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, which provides guidance for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and instruments measured at fair value. The
statement defines fair value, establishes a fair value measurement framework and expands fair value disclosures. It emphasizes that fair value is market-based with the highest measurement hierarchy level being market prices in active markets. The
standard requires fair value measurements be disclosed by hierarchy level, an entity include its own credit standing in the measurement of its liabilities and modifies the transaction price presumption.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement 157

which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2008 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The provision of SFAS 157 is applied
prospectively. We adopted the required portions of SFAS 157 at the beginning of 2008 which did not have a material impact to our financial statements. Adoption of the portions of SFAS 157 within the scope of FSP FAS 157-2 will not have a material
impact on our financial statements beginning in 2009.

Future Accounting Changes

The FASB’s standard-setting process is ongoing and until new standards have been finalized and issued by FASB, we cannot determine the impact on the reporting of our operations and financial position that may
result from any such future changes. The FASB is currently working on several projects including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, liabilities and equity, derivatives disclosures, earnings per share calculations and leases. We are also
monitoring the potential adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards in the U.S. The ultimate pronouncements resulting from these and future projects could have an impact on our future results of operations and financial position.

Impact of Inflation

While it is difficult to
accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management
evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, long-lived assets, claims and contingencies, income taxes and revenue recognition. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical
experience and various other


factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management has discussed the development
and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting its results of operations and financial
position.

Inventories

Inventories are principally
valued at the lower of cost or market, on a weighted-average cost basis.

We record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of specific
inventory items on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical
experience. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates.

We also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory. These estimates are
based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends.

Management does not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates
will change significantly based on prior experience. A 10% increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately $6 million for 2008. A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory
loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately $2 million for 2008.

Valuation of Long-lived Assets

Property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of the asset may not be recoverable. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, usually determined
by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset. Factors used in the valuation include, but are not limited to, management’s plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results and projected future cash flows.
When a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life.

Goodwill is reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. The impairment
review is performed by comparing each reporting unit’s carrying value to its estimated fair value, determined through either estimated discounted future cash flows or market-based methodologies. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair
value, we determine the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, we recognize an impairment charge equal to the
difference.

Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if
certain events occur or circumstances change. The impairment review is performed by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value, usually determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.

Factors used in the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets include, but are not limited to, management’s plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent
operating results and projected future cash flows. If future economic conditions are different than those projected by management, future impairment charges may be required.


Impairment of La Senza Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets

In conjunction with the January 2007 acquisition of La Senza, we recorded $313 million in goodwill and $170 million in trade name intangible assets. These assets
are included in the La Senza reporting unit which is part of the Victoria’s Secret segment. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed our annual impairment testing under SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS 142”). We concluded that goodwill and certain trade name assets related to the La Senza acquisition were impaired. We recorded impairment charges of $189 million and $26 million related to the goodwill and trade name assets,
respectively. These impairment charges are included in Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets on the 2008 Consolidated Statement of Income.

The estimated fair values of our other reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values as of the fourth quarter of 2008. Accordingly, no goodwill impairment charges were recorded for these reporting units. Reasonable changes in
the significant estimates and assumptions used to determine these fair values would not have resulted in goodwill impairments in any of these reporting units. If economic conditions in 2009 and beyond continue to deteriorate, future impairment
charges may be required.

Impairment Indicators

The primary impairment indicator associated with the impairment charge was the deterioration in La Senza’s operating results during the latter half of 2008, particularly when compared to our expectations at the time of the
acquisition. La Senza’s operating results were negatively impacted by the global economic downturn and the resulting impact on the Canadian retail environment.

Impairment Testing

We evaluated La Senza’s goodwill by comparing the carrying value of the La Senza reporting
unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit derived using a discounted cash flow methodology. We corroborated the estimated fair value of the La Senza reporting unit as determined by our discounted cash flow approach by referencing a
market-based methodology. Based on our evaluation, the carrying value of the La Senza reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value. As a result, we measured the goodwill impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142 by comparing the
carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the implied value of the goodwill based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, considering the fair value of all assets and liabilities. As a result of this analysis, we recognized
a goodwill impairment charge of $189 million.

We evaluated the La Senza trade name assets by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value
determined using a relief from royalty methodology. Based on our evaluation, the carrying value of certain La Senza trade name assets exceeded their estimated fair value and, as a result, we recognized impairment charges totaling $26 million to
reduce the carrying values to their estimated fair values.

Significant Estimates and Assumptions

The discounted cash flow models used to estimate the applicable fair values involve numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective. Changes to these
estimates and assumptions could materially impact the fair value estimates. The estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include: (i) estimated future cash flow generated by La Senza; (ii) discount rates used
to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair values; and (iii) the terminal value assumption used in the discounted cash flow methodologies. These and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and
expectations of management and may change in the future based on period-specific facts and circumstances. If economic conditions in 2009 and beyond continue to deteriorate, future impairment charges may be required.

Sensitivity Analysis

Our determination of the estimated fair value
of the La Senza reporting unit and trade name assets requires significant judgment about economic factors, industry factors, as well as our views regarding the future prospects


of the La Senza reporting unit. Changes in these judgments may have a significant effect on the estimated fair value of La Senza’s goodwill and trade
name assets. The following provides sensitivities related to the significant estimates and assumptions as noted above:

•

a 10% decrease in estimated future cash flows would result in a $33 million increase in the impairment charges.

•

a 1% increase in the discount rate would result in a $13 million increase in the impairment charges.

•

a 10% decrease in the terminal value assumption would result in a $25 million increase in the impairment charges.

Claims and Contingencies

We are subject to various claims and
contingencies related to lawsuits, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. Our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements is based on
management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency. We consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts within and outside our organization with
respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. We accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible (as opposed to
probable), or if an estimate is not determinable, disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and
liability method. Under this method, the amount of taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our Consolidated
Statement of Income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.

Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In determining our provision
for income taxes, we use an annual effective income tax rate based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates. We adjust the annual effective income tax rate as additional information on
outcomes or events becomes available. Our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings.

Effective February 4, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation 48 (“FIN 48”) and FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FIN 48-1,

Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109

. FIN 48 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. The first step
is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The
second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may
require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.


Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities.
These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various
tax authorities. We record an accrual for more likely than not exposures after evaluating the positions associated with our various income tax filings. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual
is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual when the
statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.

Although we
believe that our estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

While our recognition of revenue does not
involve significant judgment, revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy for our organization. We recognize revenue upon customer receipt of the merchandise. For direct response revenues, we estimate shipments that have not been
received by the customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times. We also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience.

All of our brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers in retail stores, through our direct channels and through third parties. We do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards. We recognize
income from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer. In addition, we recognize income on unredeemed gift cards when we can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit
the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions (gift card breakage). We determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. We accumulated sufficient historical data to determine the gift card breakage rate at
Bath & Body Works and Express during the fourth quarter of 2005 and Victoria’s Secret during the fourth quarter of 2007. Gift card breakage is included in Net Sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recognized $30 million in pre-tax income related to the initial recognition of gift card breakage at Express and Bath &
Body Works. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we recognized $48 million in pre-tax income related to the initial recognition of gift card breakage at Victoria’s Secret.

Additionally, we recognize revenue associated with merchandise sourcing services provided to third parties, consisting primarily of former subsidiaries as well as other third parties. Revenue is recognized at the time
the title passes to the customer.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Market Risk

The market risk inherent in our financial instruments
represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates.

Our
foreign exchange rate exposure is primarily the result of the January 2007 acquisition of La Senza Corporation, whose operations are conducted primarily in Canada. To mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our investment
in La Senza associated with fluctuations in the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange rate, we entered into a series of cross-currency swaps related to Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans. These cross-currency swaps require the periodic
exchange of fixed rate Canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate U.S. dollar interest payments as well as exchange of Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar principal payments upon maturity. The swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the
same


time as the related loans. As a result of the Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans and the related cross-currency swaps, we do not believe there is
any material translation risk associated with fluctuations in the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange rate.

In addition, La Senza’s Canadian dollar
denominated earnings are subject to U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange rate risk as substantially all of La Senza’s merchandise is sourced through U.S. dollar transactions.

We are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to our investments and our debt. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on
their original maturities. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any
single issuer. The primary objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. Currently, our investment portfolio is comprised
primarily of U.S. government-backed securities. Given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk associated with increases or decreases in interest rates.

All of our long-term debt as of January 31, 2009 has fixed interest rates with the exception of our $750 million term loan due August 2012. Thus, our exposure to
interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. Our $750 million term loan due August 2012 contains a variable interest rate that fluctuates based on
changes in an underlying benchmark interest rate and changes in our credit rating. In January 2008, we executed a participating interest rate swap arrangement which limits our exposure to increases in the benchmark interest rate while allowing us to
partially participate in any decreases in the benchmark interest rate.

We use derivative financial instruments like the cross-currency swaps and the
participating interest rate swap arrangement to manage exposure to market risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

As of January 31, 2009, management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents,
receivables and payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments.

The following table provides a summary of
the carrying value and fair value of long-term debt and swap arrangements as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008:

(a)

Includes current portion of long-term debt of $7 million.

(b)

The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt is based on quoted market prices. The estimated fair value of our $750 million term loan is equal to its carrying value. On
February 19, 2009, the terms of the Term Loan were amended. The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange.

(c)

Swap arrangements are in an (asset) liability position.


The decrease in estimated fair value of our long-term debt from February 2, 2008 to January 31, 2009 reflects
the substantial increase in volatility in the credit markets and the associated higher yields on our publicly traded debt. The change in fair value of the cross currency-swap arrangements from February 2, 2008 to January 31, 2009 is
primarily due to the fluctuations in the U.S. dollar—Canadian dollar exchange rate. The change in fair value of the participating interest rate swap arrangement from February 2, 2008 to January 31, 2009 is primarily due to the decline
in the underlying benchmark interest rate.

Concentration of Credit Risk

We maintain cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions, as well as corporate commercial paper from time to time. Currently, our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of U.S.
government-backed securities.

We monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions and other entities with whom we transact and limit the
amount of credit exposure with any one entity. We also monitor the creditworthiness of entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business and counterparties to derivative instruments.

LIMITED BRANDS, INC.

INDEX TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. Fiscal years are designated in the Consolidated
Financial Statements and Notes by the calendar year in which the fiscal year commences. The results for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 represent the 52 week period ending January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively, and 2006 refers to

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding
the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2009. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).

Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2009.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst &
Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young LLP’s report appears on the following page and expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2009.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Limited Brands, Inc.:

We have audited Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Limited Brands, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, and the
related Consolidated Statements of Income, Shareholders’ Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2009 of Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries, and our report dated March 27, 2009 expressed
an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial Statements

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Limited Brands,
Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 31, 2009 and
February 2, 2008, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Shareholders’ Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2009. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,
the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries at January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2007 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”, and in 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (R), “Share-Based Payment.”

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of
January 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Limited Brands, Inc. (the Company) operates in the highly competitive specialty retail business. The Company is a specialty retailer of women's intimate and other
apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories. The Company sells its merchandise through specialty retail stores in the United States and Canada, which are primarily mall-based, and through its websites and catalogue. The Company
currently operates the following retail brands:

•

Victoria’s Secret

•

Pink (Victoria’s Secret)

•

La Senza

•

Bath & Body Works

•

C. O. Bigelow

•

The White Barn Candle Company

•

Henri Bendel

Basis of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of Express and Limited Stores through their divestiture dates which were July 6, 2007 and August 3, 2007, respectively.

Subsequent to the divestitures of Express and Limited Stores, the Company’s remaining 25% ownership interest in each is accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. The Company eliminates in consolidation 25% of sourcing sales to Express and Limited Stores consistent with the Company’s ownership percentage.

The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements also include less than 100% owned variable interest entities in which the Company is designated as the primary beneficiary in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

(“FIN 46(R)”).

The Company accounts for investments in unconsolidated
entities where it exercises significant influence, but does not have control, using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company recognizes its share of the investee net income or loss. Losses are only
recognized to the extent the Company has positive carrying value related to the investee. Carrying values are only reduced below zero if the Company has an obligation to provide funding to the investee. The Company’s share of net income or loss
of unconsolidated entities from which the Company purchases merchandise or merchandise components is included in Cost of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company’s share of net income or loss of all
other unconsolidated entities is included in Other Income (Loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company’s equity investments are required to be tested for impairment when it is determined there may be an other than temporary loss
in value.

Fiscal Year

The Company’s fiscal year
ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. As used herein, “2008” and “2007” refer to the 52-week periods ending January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively. “2006” refers to the 53-week period
ended February 3, 2007.


Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and Cash Equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions and highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than 90
days. The Company’s outstanding checks, which amounted to $86 million as of January 31, 2009 and $121 million as of February 2, 2008, are included in Accounts Payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company maintains cash and cash
equivalents with various major financial institutions, as well as corporate commercial paper from time to time. Currently, the Company’s investment portfolio is comprised primarily of U.S. government-backed securities.

The Company monitors the relative credit standing of financial institutions and other entities with whom the Company transacts and limits the amount of credit exposure
with any one entity. The Company also monitors the creditworthiness of entities to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business and counterparties to derivative instruments.

Inventories

Inventories are
principally valued at the lower of cost or market, on a weighted-average cost basis.

The Company records valuation adjustments to its inventories if the
cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount it expects to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis
of historical experience.

The Company also records inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of
the last physical inventory. These estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends.

Catalogue and
Advertising Costs

The Company capitalizes the direct costs of producing and distributing its catalogues and amortizes the costs over the expected
future revenue stream, which is generally three months from the date the catalogues are mailed.

The Company’s capitalized direct response advertising
costs amounted to $27 million and $33 million as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively, and are included in Other Current Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All other advertising costs are expensed at the time the
promotion first appears in media or in the store. Catalogue and advertising costs amounted to $502 million for 2008, $507 million for 2007 and $594 million for 2006.

Property and Equipment

The Company’s property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciation/amortization
is computed on a straight-line basis using the following depreciable life ranges:


When a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful
life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life. The Company’s cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any
resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and betterments that extend useful lives are capitalized.

Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows
related to the asset are less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value, usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset.
Factors used in the valuation include, but are not limited to, management’s plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results and projected future cash flows.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company has certain intangible assets resulting from business combinations that
are recorded at cost. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 20 years.

Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the estimated undiscounted future
cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value, usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the
asset. Factors used in the valuation include, but are not limited to, management’s plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results and projected future cash flows.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not subject to periodic amortization. Goodwill is
reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. The impairment review is performed by comparing each reporting unit’s carrying value to its estimated
fair value, determined through either estimated discounted future cash flows or market-based methodologies. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, the Company determines the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting
unit, including the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment charge equal to the difference.

Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. The impairment review is
performed by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value, usually determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.

Factors used in the
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets include, but are not limited to, management’s plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results and projected future cash flows. If future economic conditions are different than
those projected by management, future impairment charges may be required.

Leases and Leasehold Improvements

The Company has leases that contain predetermined fixed escalations of minimum rentals and/or rent abatements subsequent to taking possession of the leased property. The
Company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight-line basis commencing upon store possession date. The Company records the difference between the recognized rental expense and amounts payable under the leases as deferred lease credits. The
Company’s liability for predetermined fixed escalations of minimum rentals and/or rent abatements amounted to $90 million as of January 31, 2009 and $77 million as of February 2, 2008. These liabilities are included in Other Long-term
Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.


The Company receives allowances from
landlords related to its retail stores. These allowances are generally comprised of cash amounts received by the Company from its landlords as part of the negotiated lease terms. The Company records a receivable and a landlord allowance at the lease
commencement date (date of initial possession of the store). The deferred lease credit is amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease (including the pre-opening build-out period) and the receivable is
reduced as amounts are received from the landlord. The Company’s unamortized portion of landlord allowances, which amounted to $224 million as of January 31, 2009 and $185 million as of February 2, 2008, is included in Other Long-term
Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company also has leasehold improvements which are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful
lives or the period from the date the assets are placed in service to the end of the initial lease term. Leasehold improvements made after the inception of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or
the remaining lease term, including renewal periods, if reasonably assured.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of the Company’s foreign operations is generally the applicable local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using
the current exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. The Company’s resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not use
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(“SFAS 133”) as amended, which
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, the amount of taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is
recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.

In determining the
Company’s provision for income taxes, it uses an annual effective income tax rate based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates. The Company adjusts the annual effective income tax rate
as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available. The Company’s effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings.

Effective February 4, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation 48 (“FIN 48”) and
FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FIN 48-1,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109

. FIN 48 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and


measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes.

The first step is to evaluate the tax
position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to
measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require
periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes.

The Company’s income tax returns, like those of most companies, are
periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding the Company’s tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax
jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. The Company records an accrual for more likely than not exposures after evaluating the positions associated with its various income tax filings.
A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which the Company has established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified. The Company adjusts its tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which
matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from its established accrual, when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.
The Company includes its tax contingencies accrual, including accrued penalties and interest, in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets unless the liability is expected to be paid within one year. Changes to the tax
contingencies accrual, including accrued penalties and interest, are included in Provision for Income Taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Self Insurance

The Company is self-insured for medical, workers’ compensation, property, general liability and automobile liability up
to certain stop-loss limits. Such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. IBNR claims are estimated using historical claim information and actuarial estimates.

Minority Interest

Minority interest represents the portion of equity
interests of consolidated affiliates not owned by the Company.

Share-based Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based employee compensation in accordance with SFAS 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123(R)”). SFAS 123(R)
requires all share-based payments to employees and directors to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost over the service period based on their estimated fair value on the date of grant.

Compensation cost is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis for the fair value of awards that actually vest. Compensation expense for stock options
is recognized, net of forfeitures, using a single option approach (each option is valued as one grant, irrespective of the number of vesting tranches). Compensation cost for restricted stock is recognized, net of forfeitures, on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period.

The Company has a policy of issuing treasury shares to satisfy award exercises or conversions.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes sales upon customer
receipt of the merchandise, which for direct response revenues reflects an estimate of shipments that have not yet been received by the customer based on shipping terms and estimated delivery times. The Company’s shipping and handling revenues
are included in Net Sales with the


related costs included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company also provides a reserve for
projected merchandise returns based on prior experience. Net Sales exclude sales tax collected from customers.

The Company’s brands sell gift cards
with no expiration dates to customers. The Company does not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards. The Company recognizes income from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer. In addition, the Company recognizes income on
unredeemed gift cards when it can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and that there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions (gift card breakage). The Company determines
the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. The Company accumulated enough historical data to determine the gift card breakage rate at Bath & Body Works during the fourth quarter of 2005 and Victoria’s Secret
during the fourth quarter of 2007. Gift card breakage is included in Net Sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

During the fourth quarter of
2007, the Company recognized $48 million in pre-tax income related to the initial recognition of gift card breakage at Victoria’s Secret.

Additionally, the Company recognizes revenue associated with merchandise sourcing services provided to third parties, consisting of former subsidiaries as well as other third parties. Revenue is recognized at the time the title passes to
the customer.

Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy

The Company’s costs of goods sold include merchandise costs, net of discounts and allowances, freight and inventory shrinkage. The Company’s buying and occupancy expenses primarily include payroll, benefit costs and operating
expenses for its buying departments and distribution network, rent, common area maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance, catalogue amortization and depreciation for the Company’s stores, warehouse facilities and equipment.

General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses

The Company’s general, administrative and store operating expenses primarily include payroll and benefit costs for its store-selling and administrative departments (including corporate functions), marketing, advertising and other
operating expenses not specifically categorized elsewhere in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial
Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates and the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.


2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Principle

New Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS 161, Disclosures about
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (“SFAS 161”)

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS 161, which requires disclosures about the fair
value of derivative instruments and their gains or losses in tabular format as well as disclosures regarding credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements, counterparty credit risk and strategies and objectives for using
derivative instruments. SFAS 161 amends and expands SFAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

and is effective prospectively beginning in 2009. Adoption of SFAS 161 will impact the Company’s disclosures
about derivative instruments and hedging activities beginning in 2009.

SFAS 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (“SFAS 141(R)”)

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141(R), which establishes how the acquiring entity recognizes and measures the assets acquired, liabilities assumed,
any gain on bargain purchases and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. SFAS 141(R) requires acquisition-related costs to be expensed in the periods they are incurred, with the exception of the costs to issue debt or equity securities.
SFAS 141(R) requires disclosure of information for a business combination that occurs during the accounting period or prior to the issuance of the financial statements for the accounting period. SFAS 141(R) is effective prospectively for business
combinations with an acquisition date on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period after December 15, 2008. Adoption of SFAS 141(R) is not expected to have an impact to the Company’s financial statements.

SFAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (“SFAS 160”)

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160, which modifies reporting for noncontrolling interest (minority interest) in consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 requires noncontrolling interest be reported in
equity and establishes a new framework for recognizing net income or loss and comprehensive income by the controlling interest. SFAS 160 requires specific disclosures regarding changes in equity interest of both the controlling and noncontrolling
parties and presentation of the noncontrolling equity balance and income or loss for all periods presented. SFAS 160 is effective for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The statement is applied
prospectively upon adoption. Upon adoption, prior period financial statements will be restated for the presentation of the noncontrolling interest for comparability. Adoption of SFAS 160 will impact the presentation of noncontrolling interests in
the Company’s financial statements beginning in 2009.

SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“SFAS
159”)

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159 permitting entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at
fair value. The standard also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparison between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. If the fair value option
is elected, the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value is reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The statement is applied prospectively upon adoption. The Company did not adopt fair value
treatment for any assets or liabilities under SFAS 159 as of the beginning of 2008.

SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS 157”)

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, which provides guidance for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and instruments measured at
fair value that are classified in shareholders’ equity. The statement defines fair value, establishes a fair value measurement framework and expands fair value disclosures. It emphasizes that fair value is market-based with the highest
measurement hierarchy level being market prices in active markets. The standard requires fair value measurements be disclosed by hierarchy level, an entity include its own credit standing in the measurement of its liabilities and modifies the
transaction price presumption.


In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS
157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement 157

, which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or
disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually).

Accordingly, as of February 3, 2008, the Company
adopted SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities only. As of January 31, 2009, the Company’s financial assets and liabilities subject to SFAS 157 consisted of the cross-currency interest rate swaps and the participating interest rate
swap. The fair value of these instruments is determined using valuation methodologies that employ Level 2 inputs as defined in SFAS 157. The adoption of SFAS 157 for financial assets and financial liabilities did not have a significant impact
on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Adoption of portions of SFAS 157 within the scope of FSP FAS 157-2 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements beginning in 2009.

Changes in Accounting Principle

Income
Taxes

Effective February 4, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”), an
interpretation of FASB Statement 109. Upon adoption, the Company recognized an additional $10 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as a reduction to the Company’s opening balance of retained earnings on
February 4, 2007. For additional information, see Note 13, “Income Taxes.”

Share-based Compensation

On January 29, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123(R)”), which requires the measurement and
recognition of compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company accounted for share-based awards to employees and
directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”). Under the intrinsic value method, no stock-based compensation expense was
recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income, other than for restricted stock, because the exercise price of the Company’s stock options granted to employees and directors was equal to the estimated fair market value of
the underlying stock at the date of grant.

The Company adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method, which required the
application of the accounting standard as of January 29, 2006, the first day of the Company’s fiscal year 2006.

Share-based compensation expense
recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income under SFAS 123(R) is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and, accordingly, has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant
and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended February 3, 2007 of $0.7
million (net of tax of $0.4 million) relates to an estimate of forfeitures of previously recognized unvested restricted stock awards outstanding as of January 29, 2006, the date of adoption of SFAS 123(R).

3. Earnings Per Share

Earnings per basic share is computed based on
the weighted-average number of outstanding common shares. Earnings per diluted share include the weighted-average effect of dilutive options and restricted stock on the weighted-average shares outstanding.


The following table provides shares utilized for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2008, 2007
and 2006:

(a)

These options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices were greater than or equal to the average market price of the common
shares and, therefore, their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

4. Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company has foreign exchange rate exposure primarily as a result of the January 2007 acquisition of La Senza Corporation whose operations are conducted primarily in
Canada. To mitigate the exposure to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange rate, the Company entered into a series of cross-currency swaps related to approximately $470 million Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans. These
cross-currency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate Canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate U.S. dollar interest payments as well as exchange of Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar principal payments upon maturity. The swap
arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same time as the related loans.

The cross-currency interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges
of foreign currency exchange risk. Changes in the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange rate result in reclassification of amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings to offset foreign currency transaction gains and losses
recognized on the intercompany loans. The Company’s aggregate fair value of foreign currency swap arrangements was an asset of $26 million as of January 31, 2009 and a liability of $54 million as of February 2, 2008. The asset and
liability are included in Other Assets and Other Long-term Liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In March and June 2007, the
Company entered into interest rate lock agreements designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the anticipated future issuance of debt. In conjunction with the Company’s issuance of notes during July
2007, the interest rate locks were settled. Based on changes between the anticipated and actual amount and timing of the debt issuance, the Company concluded during the second quarter of 2007 that the interest rate locks no longer qualified as cash
flow hedges. As a result, $17 million of realized pre-tax gains from the settlement of the interest rate locks was recognized in earnings in the second quarter of 2007. The gain on the interest rate lock agreements is included in Other Income (Loss)
on the 2007 Consolidated Statement of Income.

In January 2008, the Company entered into a participating interest rate swap arrangement designated as a
cash flow hedge to mitigate exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to the Company’s $750 million term loan. The fair value of the participating interest rate swap arrangement was a liability of $30 million as of January 31, 2009
and $13 million as of February 2, 2008. The liability is included in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

On
February 3, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities. The fair values of the derivative instruments are determined using valuation methodologies that employ Level 2 inputs as defined in SFAS 157.

7.
Restructuring Activities


During the
fourth quarter of 2008, the Company initiated a restructuring program designed to resize the Company’s corporate infrastructure and to adjust for the impact of the current retail environment. This program resulted in the elimination of
approximately 400 positions (or 10%) of the Company’s corporate and home office headcount. The Company recognized a pre-tax charge consisting of severance and related costs of $23 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009. These
costs are included in General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses on the 2008 Consolidated Statement of Income.


In 2007, the Company completed a restructuring program designed to resize the Company’s corporate infrastructure and to adjust for the impact of the Apparel
divestitures. This program resulted in the elimination of approximately 500 positions (or 10%) of the Company’s corporate and home office headcount through position eliminations and transfers to Express and Limited Stores. The Company
recognized pre-tax charges consisting primarily of severance and related costs of $34 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008. These costs are included in General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses on the 2007 Consolidated

The following table provides intangible assets with finite lives as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008:

Amortization expense was $6 million for 2008, $14 million for 2007 and $11 million for 2006. Estimated future
annual amortization expense will be approximately $6 million in each of 2009, 2010 and 2011, $3 million in 2012 and 2013 and $8 million thereafter.

Impairment Charges

La Senza

In
conjunction with the January 2007 acquisition of La Senza, the Company recorded $313 million in goodwill, $170 million in intangible assets with indefinite lives and $26 million in intangible assets with finite lives. These assets are included in
the La Senza reporting unit which is part of the Victoria’s Secret reportable segment.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company completed its
annual impairment testing. During the latter half of 2008, La Senza’s operating results were negatively impacted by the global economic downturn and the resulting impact on the Canadian retail environment. As part of the annual impairment
evaluation, the Company assessed the recoverability of goodwill using a discounted cash flow methodology. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the La Senza goodwill exceeded the implied fair value based on the estimated fair value of the
La Senza reporting unit. Accordingly, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $189 million. The goodwill impairment charge is included in Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets on the 2008 Consolidated Statement of Income.

Prior to completing the goodwill impairment evaluation, the Company performed its annual impairment analysis for indefinite-lived trade names. Based on
its evaluation using a relief from royalty methodology, the Company concluded that certain La Senza trade name assets were impaired. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $25 million to reduce the carrying value of these assets
to their estimated fair values. The Company also recognized a $1 million impairment charge related to a finite lived trade name asset. These impairment charges are included in Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets on the 2008
Consolidated Statement of Income.


Personal Care Joint Venture

In February 2007, the Company acquired a personal care products business along with an investment partner. Net assets of the acquired business
consisted primarily of goodwill. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company and its investment partner made a decision to close the operations of the acquired business. Based on this decision, the Company completed a valuation of the acquired
business trade name, which the Company continues to use. Based on the Company’s evaluation, $12 million of the $25 million purchase price was allocated to the trade name. The remaining $13 million was recognized as an impairment charge in the
second quarter of 2007. The Company recognized the investment partner’s portion of the impairment charge of $6 million in Minority Interest on the 2007 Consolidated Statement of Income.

11. Equity Investments and Other

Express

On July 6, 2007, the Company completed the divestiture of 75% of its ownership interest in Express to affiliates of Golden Gate Capital. The Company’s
remaining 25% investment in Express is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

In March 2008, Express distributed cash to its owners and the
Company received $41 million. The Company’s portion representing a return of capital is $28 million and is included in Return of Capital from Express within the Investing Activities section of the 2008 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The
remaining $13 million is considered a return on capital and is included in Other Assets and Liabilities within the Operating Activities section of the 2008 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

In July 2008, Express distributed additional cash to its owners and the Company received $71 million. The Company’s portion representing a return of capital is $67
million with the remaining $4 million representing a return on capital. The proceeds received from the cash distribution were in excess of the Company’s carrying value of the investment in Express. As a result, the carrying value was reduced to
zero as of the date of the cash distribution and a pre-tax gain of approximately $13 million was recorded. The gain is included in Other Income on the 2008 Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company’s investment carrying value for Express
was zero as of January 31, 2009 and $99 million as of February 2, 2008. These amounts are included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Limited Stores

On August 3, 2007, the Company completed the divestiture of 75% of its ownership interest in Limited Stores to
affiliates of Sun Capital. The Company’s remaining 25% investment in Limited Stores is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, the Company recorded 25% of Limited Stores’ results for the period from August 4,
2007 through January 31, 2009 in Other Income (Loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company’s investment carrying value for Limited Stores was $12 million as of January 31, 2009 and $13 million as of February 2,
2008 and is included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Easton Investment

The Company has land and other investments in Easton, a 1,300 acre planned community in Columbus, Ohio that integrates office, hotel, retail, residential and recreational
space. These investments, at cost, totaled $63 million as of January 31, 2009 and $62 million as of February 2, 2008 and are recorded in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Included in the Company’s Easton investments is an equity interest in Easton Town Center, LLC (“ETC”), an entity that owns and has developed a commercial
entertainment and shopping center. The Company’s investment in ETC is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Company has a majority financial interest in ETC, but another unaffiliated member manages ETC. Certain significant
decisions regarding ETC require the consent of unaffiliated members in addition to the Company.


In July 2007, ETC refinanced its $290 million secured bank loan replacing it with a $405 million secured bank loan.
The loan is payable in full on August 9, 2017.

In conjunction with the loan refinancing, ETC repaid the existing loan, reserved cash for capital
expenditures and operations and authorized the distribution of $150 million to ETC members. As an ETC member, the Company received approximately $102 million of proceeds resulting in a $100 million gain after reducing the Company’s ETC carrying
value from $2 million to zero. The gain is included in Other Income (Loss) on the 2007 Consolidated Statement of Income.

Total assets of ETC were
approximately $253 million as of January 31, 2009 and $262 million as of February 2, 2008.

Other

In April 2008, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $19 million related to an unconsolidated joint venture accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. The charge consisted of writing down the investment balance, reserving certain accounts and notes receivable and accruing a contractual liability. The impairment of $19 million is included in Net Gain on Joint Ventures on the 2008
Consolidated Statement of Income.

12. Accrued Expenses and Other

The following table provides additional information about the composition of accrued expenses and other as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008:


13. Income Taxes

The following table provides the components of the Company’s provision for income taxes for 2008, 2007 and 2006:

The foreign component of pre-tax income, arising principally from overseas operations, was a loss of $90 million
for 2008 which includes the impact of the $215 million impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and changes in transfer pricing. The foreign pre-tax income was $40 million for 2007 and $54 million for 2006. The non-U.S. tax provision
reflects the impact of enacted statutory rate decreases in Canada.

The following table provides the reconciliation between the statutory federal income
tax rate and the effective tax rate for 2008, 2007 and 2006:

The Company’s effective tax rate has historically reflected and continues to reflect a provision related to
the undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates. The Company has recorded a deferred tax liability for those amounts, but the taxes are not paid until the earnings are deemed repatriated to the United States.


Deferred Taxes

The
following table provides the effect of temporary differences that cause deferred income taxes as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future effects on income taxes resulting from
temporary differences and carryforwards at the end of the respective year.

As of January 31, 2009, the Company had available for state income tax purposes net operating loss
carryforwards which expire, if unused, in the years 2009 through 2026. The Company has analyzed the realization of the state net operating loss carryforwards on an individual state basis. In the second quarter of 2007, a substantial portion of the
valuation allowance was reversed in connection with the Apparel divestitures. For those states where the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that the state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation
allowance has been provided for the deferred tax asset.

As of January 31, 2009, the Company had available for non-U.S. tax purposes net operating
loss carryforwards which expire, if unused, in the years 2028 and 2029. The Company has determined that it is more likely than not that all of the net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized and a valuation allowance has been provided for
the net deferred tax assets, including the net operating loss carryforwards, of the related tax loss entity.

Income taxes payable on the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets included net current deferred tax liabilities of $2 million as of January 31, 2009 and $4 million as of February 2, 2008. The Company also had net current deferred tax assets of $78 million and $75 million as of
January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively, which are included in Other Current Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income tax payments were $205 million for 2008, $428 million for 2007 and $451 million for 2006.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Effective February 4,
2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”), an interpretation of FASB Statement 109. FIN 48 requires that a position taken or expected to
be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. A recognized tax position is
then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Upon adoption, the Company recognized an additional $10 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was
accounted for as a reduction to the Company’s opening balance of retained earnings on February 4, 2007. Including this adjustment, the Company had $131 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of February 4, 2007, $85 million of which,
if recognized, would reduce the effective income tax rate and $6 million of which, if recognized, would reduce Goodwill. Additionally, the Company reclassified $107 million of unrecognized tax benefits from Current Liabilities—Income Taxes to
Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.


The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of
$164 million and $144 million as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively, of which $95 million and $97 million would reduce the effective income tax rate for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax
benefits, it is reasonably possible that $41 million could change in the next twelve months due to audit settlements, expiration of statute of limitations or other resolution of uncertainties. Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax
regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be different from this estimate. In such case, the Company will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the tax provision or reclassify
amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the period in which such matter is effectively settled with the tax authority.

The Company recognizes
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as components of income tax expense. For 2008, $7 million of interest and penalties was included in the Provision for Income Tax. The Company has accrued approximately $47 million and $40
million for the payment of interest and penalties as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively.

The following table summarizes the
activity related to its unrecognized tax benefits for U.S. federal, state & non-U.S. tax jurisdictions for 2008 and 2007 without interest and penalties:

The Company files U.S. federal income tax returns as well as income tax returns in various states and in non-U.S.
jurisdictions. At the end of 2008, the Company was subject to examination by the IRS for calendar years 2006 through 2008. The Company is also subject to various U.S. state and local income tax examinations for the years 1999 to 2008. Finally, the
Company is subject to multiple non-U.S. tax jurisdiction examinations for the years 2000 to 2008. In some situations, the Company determines that it does not have a filing requirement in a particular tax jurisdiction. Where no return has been filed,
no statute of limitations applies. Accordingly, if a tax jurisdiction reaches a conclusion that a filing requirement does exist, additional years may be reviewed by the tax authority. The Company believes it has appropriately accounted for
uncertainties related to this issue.


14. Long-term Debt

The following table provides the Company’s long-term debt balance as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008:

In July 2007, the Company issued $700 million of 6.90% notes due July 15, 2017 and $300 million of 7.60%
notes due July 15, 2037 utilizing a shelf registration statement under which up to $1 billion of debt securities, common and preferred stock and other securities could be issued. Interest on the notes is payable on January 15 and
July 15 of each year.

On August 3, 2007, the Company amended the October 2004 $500 million term loan agreement to increase the borrowing
capacity to $750 million and extend the term to August 2012. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company borrowed the additional $250 million under the term loan agreement.

On August 3, 2007, the Company amended its $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “5-Year Facility”) by extending its term to August 2012 and executed a $500 million, 364-day unsecured
revolving credit facility (the “364-Day Facility”). On July 11, 2008, the Company renewed the 364-Day Facility and reduced its size to $300 million. Both facilities support the Company’s commercial paper and letter of credit
programs. As of January 31, 2009, there were no borrowings outstanding under either facility and no commercial paper outstanding. Fees payable under the 5-Year Facility are based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings and were 0.15% of
the committed amount per year as of January 31, 2009. Fees payable under the 364-Day Facility are also based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings and were 0.35% of the committed amount per year as of January 31, 2009.

In January 2006, Mast Industries (Far East) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Limited Brands, Inc., entered into a $60 million unsecured revolving credit
facility. During 2006, $30 million was drawn on the facility while the remaining $30 million expired in March 2006. The credit facility was available for general corporate purposes including the funding of dividends to Limited Brands, Inc.
Borrowings under the credit facility are due in equal semi-annual installments through the maturity date of the credit facility in January 2010. In October 2008, the Company repaid the Credit Facility due January 2010 and the related current portion
of long-term debt.


The facilities and the Term Loan have
several interest rate options, which are based in part on the Company’s long-term credit ratings. These agreements also require the Company to maintain certain specified fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios and prohibit certain types of
liens on property or assets. The Company was in compliance with the covenant requirements as of January 31, 2009.

In January 2008, the Company
entered into a participating interest rate swap arrangement designated as a cash flow hedge to mitigate exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to the Term Loan. The participating interest rate swap limits the Company’s exposure to
increases in the benchmark interest rate while allowing the Company to partially participate in any decreases in the benchmark interest rate. For additional information, See Note 4, “Derivative Instruments.”

On February 19, 2009, the Company amended its 5-Year Facility, amended its Term Loan and canceled its 364-Day Facility. For additional information, see Note
22, “Subsequent Event.”

The following table provides principal payments due on long-term debt in the next five fiscal years and the remaining
years thereafter:

Cash paid for interest was $174 million in 2008, $151 million in 2007 and $100
million in 2006.

15. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

SFAS 107,

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

(“SFAS 107”), requires management to disclose the estimated fair value of certain assets and liabilities defined by SFAS 107 as financial instruments. As of
January 31, 2009, management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of their short maturity.

Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement, if available. In the absence of quoted prices
for identical or similar assets or investments in active markets, fair value is estimated using various valuation methods including cash flow analysis and appraisals.

The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt was $2.1 billion compared to the carrying value of $2.9 billion as of January 31, 2009. As of February 2, 2008, the estimated fair value of the
Company’s long-term debt was $2.8 billion compared to the carrying value of $2.9 billion. The estimated fair value of the Company’s publicly traded debt is based on quoted market prices. The estimated fair value of the $750 million term
loan is equal to its carrying value. On February 19, 2009, the terms of the Term Loan were amended. The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange.

The aggregate estimated fair value of the Company’s foreign currency swap arrangements was an asset of $26 million as of January 31, 2009 and a liability of
$54 million as of February 2, 2008. The estimated fair value of the Company’s participating interest rate swap arrangement was a liability of $30 million as of January 31, 2009 and $13 million as of February 2, 2008.


16. Leases

The
Company is committed to noncancelable leases with remaining terms generally from one to ten years. A substantial portion of the Company’s leases consist of store leases generally with an initial term of ten years. Annual store rent consists of
a fixed minimum amount and/or contingent rent based on a percentage of sales exceeding a stipulated amount. Store lease terms generally require additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses. These additional
payments are excluded from the table below.

The following table provides rent expense for 2008, 2007 and 2006:

The following table provides the Company’s minimum rent commitments under noncancelable operating leases in
the next five fiscal years and the remaining years thereafter:

(a)

Excludes additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses generally required by store lease terms.

The Company’s future sublease income under noncancelable subleases was $14 million as of January 31, 2009, which included $3 million of rent commitments
related to disposed businesses under master lease arrangements.

17. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of
business. Management believes that the ultimate liability arising from such claims and contingencies, if any, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Guarantees

In connection with the disposition of certain
businesses, the Company has remaining guarantees of approximately $194 million related to lease payments of Express, Limited Stores, Abercrombie & Fitch, Tween Brands (formerly Limited Too and Too, Inc.), Dick’s Sporting Goods
(formerly Galyan’s), Lane Bryant, New York & Company and Anne.x under the current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through


2019. These guarantees include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that
commenced prior to the disposition of the businesses. In certain instances, the Company’s guarantee may remain in effect if the term of a lease is extended.

In April 2008, the Company received an irrevocable standby letter of credit from Express of $34 million issued by a third-party bank to mitigate a portion of the Company’s contingent liability for guaranteed future lease payments of
Express. The Company can draw from the irrevocable standby letter of credit if Express were to default on any of the guaranteed leases. The irrevocable standby letter of credit is reduced through September 30, 2010, the expiration date of the
letter of credit, consistent with the overall reduction in guaranteed lease payments. The outstanding balance of the irrevocable standby letter of credit from Express was $19 million as of January 31, 2009.

The Company’s guarantees related to Express, Limited Stores and New York & Company are subject to the provisions of SFAS 145,

Rescission, Amendment and
Technical Correction of Certain Accounting Standards,

which requires fair value accounting for these guarantee obligations. The guaranteed lease payments related to Express (net of the irrevocable standby letter of credit), Limited Stores and
New York & Company totaled $94 million and $180 million as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively. The estimated fair value of these guarantee obligations was $15 million and $10 million as of January 31, 2009
and February 2, 2008, respectively, and is included in Other Long-term Liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The increase in the fair value from February 2, 2008 to January 31, 2009 reflects the impact of the current
economic environment and the Company’s assessment of the risk of default on the guaranteed lease payments.

The Company’s guarantees related to
Abercrombie & Fitch, Tween Brands (formerly Limited Too and Too, Inc.), Dick’s Sporting Goods (formerly Galyan’s), Lane Bryant and Anne.x are not subject to the fair value provisions of SFAS 145 because they were executed prior to
the effective date of SFAS 145. These guarantees are subject to the provisions of SFAS 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

, which requires that a loss be accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. As of January 31, 2009 and
February 2, 2008, the Company had no liability recorded with respect to any of the guarantee obligations subject to SFAS 5 as it concluded that performance under these guarantees was not probable.

18. Retirement Benefits

The Company sponsors a tax-qualified defined
contribution retirement plan and a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for substantially all of its associates within the United States of America. Participation in the tax-qualified plan is available to associates who meet certain age and
service requirements. Participation in the non-qualified plan is made available to associates who meet certain age, service, job level and compensation requirements.

The qualified plan permits associates to elect contributions up to the maximum limits allowable under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches associate contributions according to a predetermined formula and
contributes additional amounts based on a percentage of the associates’ eligible annual compensation and years of service. Associate contributions and Company matching contributions vest immediately. Additional Company contributions and the
related investment earnings are subject to vesting based on years of service. Total expense recognized related to the qualified plan was $40 million for 2008, $44 million for 2007 and $49 million for 2006.

The non-qualified plan is an unfunded plan which provides benefits beyond the Internal Revenue Code limits for qualified defined contribution plans. The plan permits
associates to elect contributions up to a maximum percentage of eligible compensation. The Company matches associate contributions according to a predetermined formula and credits additional amounts based on a percentage of the associates’
eligible compensation and years of service. The plan also permits associates to defer additional compensation up to a maximum amount which the Company does not match. Associates’ accounts are credited with interest using a rate determined by
the Company. Associate contributions and the related interest vest immediately. Company


contributions and credits, along with related interest, are subject to vesting based on years of service. Associates may elect in-service distributions for
the unmatched additional deferred compensation component only. The remaining vested portion of associates’ accounts in the plan will be distributed upon termination of employment in either a lump sum or in equal annual installments over a
specified period of up to 10 years.

The following table provides the Company’s annual activity for this plan and year-end liability, included in
Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008:

(a)

Reflects transfers to the plans established by Express and Limited Stores.

Total expense recognized related to the non-qualified plan was $21 million for 2008, $22 million for 2007 and $26 million for 2006.

19.
Shareholders’ Equity

Under the authority of the Company’s Board of Directors, the Company repurchased shares of its common stock under the

20. Share-Based Compensation

Plan Summary

The 1993 Stock Option and Performance Incentive Plan as
amended (the “Plan”), which is shareholder approved, provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance-based restricted stock, performance units and
unrestricted shares. The Company grants stock options at a price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. Stock options have a maximum term of ten years. Stock options generally vest over 4 years with 25% vesting each year.
Restricted stock generally vests (the restrictions lapse) over a two to three year period.

The Limited Brands, Inc. Stock Award and Deferred Compensation
Plan for Non-Associate Directors provides for an annual stock retainer for non-associate directors. The stock issued in conjunction with this plan has no restrictions.

Under the Company’s plans, approximately 100 million options, restricted and unrestricted shares have been authorized to be granted to employees and directors. Approximately 17 million options and
shares were available for grant as of January 31, 2009.

Stock Options

The following table provides the Company’s stock option activity for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009:

(a)

The number of options expected to vest includes an estimate of expected forfeitures.

Intrinsic value for stock options is the difference between the current market value of the Company’s stock and the option strike price. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $10 million for 2008,
$80 million for 2007 and $130 million for 2006.


The total fair value at grant date of option awards vested was $13 million for 2008, $23 million for 2007 and $39 million
for 2006.

The Company’s total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested options was $8 million as of
January 31, 2009. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2 years.

The weighted-average estimated fair value of
stock options granted was $3.47 per share for 2008, $6.97 per share for 2007 and $7.61 per share for 2006.

Cash received from stock options exercised was
$31 million for 2008, $74 million for 2007 and $153 million for 2006. Tax benefits realized from tax deductions associated with stock options exercised were $5 million for 2008, $30 million for 2007 and $50 million for 2006.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (“Black-Scholes model”) for valuation of options granted to employees and directors. The Company’s
determination of the fair value of options is affected by the Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the Company’s
expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.

The following table contains the
weighted-average assumptions used during 2008, 2007 and 2006:

The expected volatility assumption is based on the Company’s analysis of historical volatility. The risk-free
interest rate assumption is based upon the average daily closing rates during the period for U.S. treasury notes that have a life which approximates the expected life of the option. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s
history and expectation of dividend payouts. The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding.

Restricted Stock

The following table provides the Company’s restricted stock
activity for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009:

The Company’s total intrinsic value of restricted stock vested was $15 million for 2008, $11 million for 2007
and $14 million for 2006.


The Company’s total fair value at grant
date of awards vested was $19 million for 2008, $8 million for 2007 and $10 million for 2006. Fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the market value of an unrestricted share on the grant date adjusted for anticipated dividend yields.

Beginning in 2006, the Company issued performance-based restricted stock awards. The fair value of these shares is measured on the date that the
performance goals and the target number of shares are communicated. The final number of shares of performance-based restricted stock issued to each employee is determined at the end of each Spring and Fall selling seasons, based upon performance
against specified financial goals. The vesting period of these awards ranges from two to three years.

As of January 31, 2009, there was $28 million
of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested restricted stock. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.

Tax benefits realized from tax deductions associated with restricted stock vested were $6 million for 2008, $5 million for 2007 and $4 million for 2006.

Income Statement Impact

Total pre-tax share-based compensation
expense recognized under SFAS 123(R) was $35 million for 2008, $44 million for 2007 and $37 million for 2006. The tax benefit associated with share-based compensation was $11 million for 2008, $14 million for 2007 and $11 million for 2006.

The following table provides share-based compensation expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2008, 2007 and 2006:

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

.

The Victoria’s Secret segment sells women’s intimate and other apparel, personal care and beauty products, and accessories under the

The following table provides the Company’s segment information as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2009, February 2, 2008
and February 3, 2007:

(a)

Results of Express and Limited Stores are included through July 6, 2007 and August 3, 2007, respectively, when the businesses were divested. Total assets for the Apparel
segment as of February 2, 2008 are not included as the businesses were divested prior to that date.

(b)

Operating income for Apparel for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008 includes the gain on divestiture of Express of $302 million and the loss on divestiture of Limited
Stores of $72 million.

(c)

Amounts presented are restated to conform with the corporate cost allocation methodology adopted at the beginning of 2008.

In 2007, the Company reviewed its corporate organization and allocation methodology as a result of changes in its business including the divestitures of Express and
Limited Stores. Consistent with these business changes, the Company has transferred certain individuals and functions from corporate to its operating business units. Beginning in 2008, the Company changed its methodology for allocating certain
remaining corporate costs to its operating business units, including, but not limited to, costs related to store real estate and store design and construction activities. This change primarily impacted General, Administrative and Store Operating
Expenses across the Company’s segments.


The Company’s international sales,
including La Senza, Bath & Body Works Canada and direct sales shipped internationally totaled $655 million in 2008, $611 million in 2007 and $100 million in 2006. The Company’s internationally based long-lived assets were $364 million
as of January 31, 2009 and $713 million as of February 2, 2008.

22. Subsequent Event

On February 19, 2009, the Company amended its $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in August 2012 (the “5-Year Facility”), amended its
$750 million term loan (“Term Loan”) maturing in August 2012 and canceled its $300 million, 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility. The amendment to the 5-Year Facility and the Term Loan includes changes to both the fixed charge
coverage and leverage covenants. Under the amended covenants, the Company is required to maintain the fixed charge coverage ratio at 1.60 or above through fiscal year 2010 and 1.75 or above thereafter. The leverage ratio, which is debt compared to
EBITDA, as those terms are defined in the agreement, must not exceed 5.0 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, 4.5 from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 through the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 and 4.0 thereafter. The amendment
also increases the interest costs and fees associated with the 5-Year Facility and the Term Loan, provides for certain security interests as defined in the agreement and limits dividends, share repurchases and other restricted payments as defined in
the agreement to $220 million per year with certain potential increases as defined in the agreement. The interest rate as of January 31, 2009 on the Term Loan would have been 6.69% had the amendment been effective at that date. The amendment does
not impact the maturity dates of either the 5-Year Facility or the Term Loan. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the amendment in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 96-19,

Debtor’s Accounting for a
Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments

, and EITF Issue 98-14,

Debtor’s Accounting for Changes in Line-of-Credit or Revolving Debt Arrangements

Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm

. The Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting as of January 31, 2009 is set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Changes in internal control over
financial reporting.

In April 2008, Mast implemented new supply chain management and finance systems and related processes in the third phase of an enterprise wide systems implementation. Various controls were modified due to the new
systems. Additionally, subsequent to implementation, we established additional compensating controls over financial reporting to ensure the accuracy and integrity of our financial statements during the post-implementation phase. We believe that
the system and process changes will enhance internal control over financial reporting in future periods. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have occurred which have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
