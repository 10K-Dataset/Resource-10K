PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.

GENERAL.

The Limited, Inc., a Delaware corporation (including its subsidiaries, the “Company”), sells women’s and men’s apparel,
women’s intimate apparel and personal care products under various trade names through its specialty retail stores and direct response (catalog and e-commerce) businesses. Merchandise is targeted to appeal to customers in various market segments
that have distinctive consumer characteristics.

DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS .

General

.

As of February 2, 2002, the Company conducted its business in two primary segments: (1) the apparel
segment, which derives its revenues from the sale of women’s and men’s apparel; and (2) Intimate Brands, Inc. (“IBI”) (a corporation in which the Company, as of February 2, 2002, held an 84% interest), which derives its revenues
from the sale of women’s intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories.

On March 21, 2002, the Company completed a tax-free
tender offer and merger which resulted in the acquisition of the remaining IBI minority interest. The total purchase price was approximately $1.6 billion, based on approximately 89 million Limited common shares issued or to be issued in the
transaction. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s 2001 Annual Report, incorporated herein by reference, for additional information regarding this transaction.


The following chart reflects the retail businesses and the number of stores in operation for each segment at February 2, 2002 and February 3, 2001.

The following table shows the changes in the number of retail stores operated by the Company for the past
five fiscal years:

(a)

Represents Cacique stores at the January 31, 1998 closure of that business.

(b)

Represents A&F stores at the May 19, 1998 split-off.

(c)

Represents 18 Galyan’s Trading Co. stores at August 31, 1999 (the date of the third party purchase of a 60% majority interest in Galyan’s Trading Co. ) and 335
Limited Too stores at the August 23, 1999 spin-off.

(d)

Represents Lane Bryant stores at August 16, 2001, the date of sale to Charming Shoppes, Inc.

The Company also owns Mast Industries, Inc., a contract manufacturer and apparel importer.

During fiscal year 2001, the
Company purchased merchandise from approximately 2,900 suppliers and factories located throughout the world. In addition to purchases through Mast, the Company purchases merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the domestic market, some of
which is manufactured overseas. The Company purchased approximately 10% of its merchandise from a single manufacturer, the loss of which would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to source its products.


Most of the merchandise and related materials for the Company’s stores is shipped to the Company’s distribution centers in the Columbus, Ohio area.
The Company uses common and contract carriers to distribute merchandise and related materials to its stores. The Company’s businesses generally have independent distribution capabilities and no business receives priority over any other
business.

The Company’s policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventory on hand in its retail stores and distribution centers so that it
can offer customers an appropriate selection of current merchandise. The Company emphasizes rapid turnover and takes markdowns as required to keep merchandise fresh and current with fashion trends.

The Company views the retail apparel market as having two principal selling seasons, spring and fall. As is generally the case in the retail apparel industry, the Company
experiences its peak sales activity during the fall season. This seasonal sales pattern results in increased inventory during the fall and Christmas holiday selling periods. During fiscal year 2001, the highest month-end inventory level was $1.4
billion at November 2001 and the lowest inventory level was $957 million at December 2001.

Merchandise sales are paid for with cash, by personal check,
and with credit cards issued by third parties, including Alliance Data Systems, which is approximately 20%-owned by the Company.

The Company offers its
customers a return policy stated as “No Sale is Ever Final.” The Company believes that certain of its competitors offer similar service policies.

The following is a brief description of each of the Company’s operating businesses, including their respective target markets.

Additional information about the Company’s business, including its revenues and profits for the last three years and selling square footage, is set forth under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” of the
2001 Annual Report and is incorporated herein by reference. For the financial results of the Company’s reportable operating segments, see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2001 Annual Report,
incorporated herein by reference.

COMPETITION.

The sale of intimate and other apparel and personal care products through retail stores is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors, including individual and chain fashion specialty stores, department stores and discount
retailers. Brand image, marketing, fashion design, price, service, fashion selection and quality are the principal competitive factors in retail store sales. The Company’s direct response business competes with numerous national and regional
catalog and e-commerce merchandisers. Brand image, marketing, fashion design, price, service, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are the principal competitive factors in catalog and e-commerce sales.

The Company is unable to estimate the number of competitors or its relative competitive position due to the large number of companies selling apparel and personal care products
through retail stores, catalogs and e-commerce.

ASSOCIATE RELATIONS.

On February 2, 2002, the Company employed approximately 100,300 associates, 71,600 of whom were part-time. In addition, temporary associates are hired during peak periods, such as the holiday season.


ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES.

The
Company’s business is principally conducted from office, distribution and shipping facilities located in the Columbus, Ohio area. Additional facilities are located in New York City, New York; Andover, Massachusetts; Kettering, Ohio; Rio Rancho,
New Mexico; Paramus, New Jersey; Hong Kong and London, England.

The distribution and shipping facilities owned by the Company consist of seven buildings
located in the Columbus, Ohio area. Excluding office space, these buildings comprise approximately 6.1 million square feet.

Substantially all of the
retail stores operated by the Company are located in leased facilities, primarily in shopping centers throughout the continental United States. A substantial portion of these lease commitments consists of store leases generally with an initial term
of ten years, with options to renew at varying terms. The leases expire at various dates between 2002 and 2028.

Typically, when space is leased for a
retail store in a shopping center, all improvements, including interior walls, floors, ceilings, fixtures and decorations, are supplied by the tenant. In certain cases, the landlord of the property may provide a construction allowance to fund all or
a portion of the cost of improvements. The cost of improvements varies widely, depending on the design, size and location of the store. Rental terms for new locations usually include a fixed minimum rent plus a percentage of sales in excess of a
specified amount. Certain operating costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, insurance and taxes are typically paid by tenants.


ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

The
Company is a defendant in a variety of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business.

On January 13, 1999, two lawsuits were filed against the
Company, as well as other defendants, including many national retailers. Both lawsuits relate to labor practices allegedly employed on the island of Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, by apparel manufacturers unrelated to the
Company (some of which have sold goods to the Company) and seek injunctions, unspecified monetary damages, and other relief. One lawsuit, on behalf of a class of unnamed garment workers, was filed in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California, Western Division and subsequently transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands. It alleged violations of federal statutes, the United States Constitution, and international law. A first
amended complaint was filed on April 28, 2000, which added additional defendants but did not otherwise substantively alter either the claims alleged or relief sought. On November 26, 2001, a motion to dismiss the first amended complaint for failure
to state a claim upon which relief can be granted was granted in part and denied in part. A second amended complaint, which added neither new parties nor claims but realleged claims previously dismissed, was filed on December 17, 2001. A motion to
dismiss the second amended complaint was filed on January 14, 2002, and remains pending. The second lawsuit was filed by a national labor union and other organizations in the Superior Court of the State of California, San Francisco County, and
alleges unfair business practices under California law. A motion for summary judgment on that complaint was filed on October 30, 2001, and remains pending.

In May and June 1999, purported shareholders of the Company filed three derivative actions in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, naming as defendants the members of the Company’s board of directors and the Company, as
nominal defendant. The actions thereafter were consolidated. The operative complaint generally alleged that the rescission of the Contingent Stock Redemption Agreement previously entered into by the Company with Leslie H. Wexner and The Wexner
Children’s Trust (the “Contingent Stock Redemption Agreement”) constituted a waste of corporate assets and a breach of the board members’ fiduciary duties, and that the issuer tender offer completed on June 3, 1999 was a
“wasteful transaction in its own right.” On July 30, 1999, all defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, both on the ground that it failed to allege facts showing that demand on the board to institute such an action would be futile and
for failure to state a claim. Plaintiffs did not respond to that motion, but on February 16, 2000, plaintiffs filed a first amended consolidated derivative complaint (the “amended complaint”), which makes allegations similar to the first
complaint concerning the rescission of the Contingent Stock Redemption Agreement and the 1999 issuer tender offer and adds allegations apparently intended to show that certain directors were not disinterested in those decisions. Defendants moved to
dismiss the amended complaint on April 14, 2000 and oral argument was heard on March 28, 2001. On March 27, 2002, the Court granted the motion in part and denied the motion in part.

Beginning on February 5, 2002 and continuing thereafter, a total of thirteen separate lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on behalf of a purported class of public shareholders of Intimate Brands,
Inc. (“IBI”) relating to the announcement by the Company that it was commencing an exchange offer for the outstanding public shares of common stock of IBI. The actions were consolidated under the caption

In re Intimate Brands Inc.
Shareholders Litig.

, Cons. C.A. No. 19382. Separately, two actions advancing similar allegations and making similar claims on behalf of IBI shareholders were filed in the Ohio Court of Common Pleas in Franklin County, Ohio, styled

Cameron v.
Wexner, et al.

, Case No. 02-CVH-021342 and

Zenderman v. Wexner, et al.

, Case No. 02-CVH-021636. As subsequently amended, these actions generally named as defendants the Company, IBI and the members of IBI’s board of directors,
challenged the Company’s disclosures to IBI shareholders in connection with the exchange offer, alleged that the exchange offer amounted to a breach of fiduciary duty or was otherwise unlawful and made various related claims and allegations. On
March 6, 2002, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle these actions which was subsequently set forth in a memorandum of understanding dated March 19, 2002. The settlement is subject to a number of conditions, including completion of
confirmatory discovery satisfactory to plaintiffs’ counsel, negotiation and execution of definitive settlement documents and approval of the proposed settlement by the Delaware Court of Chancery.

Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any litigation, in the opinion of management, the foregoing proceedings are not expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
