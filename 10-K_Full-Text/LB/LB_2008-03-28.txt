PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

Limited Brands, Inc. (the “Company”) cautions that any forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) contained in this report or made by the
Company or management of the Company involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, our future performance and financial results may differ materially
from those expressed or implied in any such forward-looking statements. Words such as “estimate,” “project,” “plan,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,”
“planned,” “potential” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements.

A number of important factors could cause our
results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including those detailed under the heading, “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.

GENERAL.

We operate in the highly competitive specialty retail business. We are a specialty retailer of women’s
intimate apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories under various trade names. We sell our merchandise through our retail stores in the United States and Canada, which are primarily mall-based, and through e-commerce and catalogue
direct response channels.

FISCAL YEAR.

Our fiscal
year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. As used herein, “2008” and “2007” refer to the 52 week periods ending January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively. “2006” refers to the 53 week
period ended February 3, 2007. “2005” and “2004” refer to the 52 week periods ended January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, respectively.

DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS.

As of February 2, 2008, we conducted our business in two primary segments:
Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works.

VICTORIA’S SECRET

The Victoria’s Secret segment sells women’s intimate and other apparel, personal care and beauty products and accessories marketed under the Victoria’s Secret and La Senza brand names. Victoria’s
Secret merchandise is sold through retail stores, its e-commerce site,

www.VictoriasSecret.com,

and catalogue. Through its e-commerce site and catalogue, certain of Victoria’s Secret’s merchandise may be purchased worldwide. La
Senza products may also be purchased through its e-commerce site,

www.LaSenza.com.

In January 2007, we completed our acquisition of La Senza
Corporation (“La Senza”). La Senza is a Canadian specialty retailer offering lingerie and sleepwear as well as apparel for girls in the 7-14 year age group. In addition, independently owned La Senza stores operate in 40 other countries.
The results of La Senza are included in the Victoria’s Secret segment. For additional information, see Note 3 and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The Victoria’s Secret segment had net sales of $5.607 billion in 2007 and operated 1,020 stores in the United States and 312 stores in Canada.



BATH & BODY WORKS

The Bath & Body Works segment sells personal care, beauty and home fragrance products marketed under the Bath & Body Works, C.O. Bigelow and White Barn Candle Company brand names in addition to
third-party brands. Bath & Body Works merchandise is sold through retail stores, its e-commerce site,

www.bathandbodyworks.com,

and catalogue.

The Bath & Body Works segment had net sales of $2.494 billion for 2007 and operated 1,592 stores in the United States.

APPAREL

Prior to the second quarter of 2007, we also operated an Apparel segment which consisted of Express and Limited Stores. In July 2007, we completed
the divestiture of 75% of our ownership interest in Express to affiliates of Golden Gate Capital for a pretax gain of $302 million. In August 2007, we completed the divestiture of 75% of our ownership interest in Limited Stores to affiliates of Sun
Capital for a pretax loss of $72 million. As of February 2, 2008, we no longer had a reportable Apparel segment, however, we retain a 25% ownership interest in both Express and Limited Stores.

OTHER

Other consists of the following:

•

Henri Bendel, operator of two specialty stores in New York, New York and Columbus, Ohio which feature fashion and personal care products for sophisticated women;

•

Mast, an apparel importer serving Victoria’s Secret and third party customers;

•

Beauty Avenues, a personal care sourcing company serving Victoria’s Secret, Bath & Body Works and third party customers; and

•

Corporate functions including non-core real estate, equity investments and other administrative functions such as treasury, tax and other centralized functions
related to store design and real estate.

In July 2007, we closed our six Diva London concept stores which sold accessories to a target
market of women ages 18 to 34.

For additional information about our business, including our net sales and profits for the last three years and selling
square footage, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. For the financial results of our reportable segments, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.



SUMMARY OF COMPANY-OWNED RETAIL LOCATIONS

The following chart provides the retail businesses and the number of our company-owned retail stores in operation for each business as of February 2, 2008 and
February 3, 2007.

(a)

In September 2007, we restated the La Senza store count from 323 to 291 as of February 3, 2007 to conform to our location count methodology.

(b)

As of February 2, 2008, we no longer have a reportable Apparel segment due to the 75% divestitures of our ownership interests in Express and Limited Stores as of July 2007 and
August 2007, respectively.

The following table provides the changes in the number of our company-owned retail stores operated for the past
five fiscal years:

(a)

Represents stores related to the 75% divestitures of our ownership interests in Express and Limited Stores as of July 2007 and August 2007, respectively.

(b)

Represents stores acquired in the La Senza acquisition on January 12, 2007. In September 2007, we restated the La Senza store count from 325 to 293 as of January 12, 2007 to
conform to our location count methodology.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

During 2007, we purchased merchandise from over 1,000 suppliers located throughout the world. In addition to purchases through Mast and Beauty Avenues, we purchase
merchandise directly in foreign and domestic markets. Excluding Mast and Beauty Avenues, no supplier provided 10% or more of our merchandise purchases.

Most of the merchandise and related materials for our stores are shipped to our distribution centers in the Columbus, Ohio area. We use a variety of shipping terms that result in the transfer of title to the merchandise at either the point
of origin or point of destination.



Our policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventories on hand in our retail stores and distribution centers to
enable us to offer customers an appropriate selection of current merchandise. We emphasize rapid turnover and take markdowns as required to keep merchandise fresh and current.

Our operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: Spring (the first and second quarters) and Fall (the third and fourth quarters). The fourth quarter, including the holiday season,
accounted for approximately one-third of net sales for 2007, 2006 and 2005. Accordingly, cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as our inventories build in advance of the holiday season.

We and our products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities. We are subject to a variety of customs
regulations and international trade arrangements.

Our trademarks and patents, which constitute our primary intellectual property, have been registered or
are the subject of pending applications in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law. We believe our products and services are identified by our intellectual
property and, thus, our intellectual property is of significant value. Accordingly, we intend to maintain our intellectual property and related registrations and vigorously protect our intellectual property assets against infringement.

COMPETITION.

The sale of intimate apparel, personal care and
beauty products and accessories through retail stores is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. Brand image, marketing, design, price,
service, assortment and quality are the principal competitive factors in retail store sales. Our direct response businesses compete with numerous national and regional e-commerce and catalogue merchandisers. Image presentation, fulfillment and the
factors affecting retail store sales discussed above are the principal competitive factors in e-commerce and catalogue sales.

ASSOCIATE RELATIONS.

On February 2, 2008, we employed approximately 97,500 associates, 78,100 of whom were part-time. In addition, temporary associates are hired during
peak periods, such as the holiday season.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

The following discussion of risk factors contains “forward-looking statements,” as
discussed in Item 1. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K, other filings or in any other discussions of our business. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

In
addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described below are not our only
risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition in a material way.

Our revenue and profit results are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending patterns.

Our growth, sales and profitability may be adversely affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or
developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. Purchases of women’s intimate apparel, apparel,
personal care and beauty products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. In such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, which would further adversely affect our
profitability.

Our net sales depend on a high volume of mall traffic and the availability of suitable lease space.

Many of our stores are located in shopping malls. Sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the high volume of traffic in those malls. Our stores benefit from the
ability of the mall’s “anchor” tenants, generally large department stores, and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores and the continuing popularity of malls as shopping destinations. Sales
volume and mall traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area, competition from non-mall retailers and other malls where we do not have stores and the closing of anchor department stores. In addition, a decline in the
desirability of the shopping environment in a particular mall, or a decline in the popularity of mall shopping among our target consumers, would adversely affect our business.

Part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. We cannot be
sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs.

Our net sales, operating income and inventory levels
fluctuate on a seasonal basis.

We experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of our
operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season. Any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionate effect on our financial condition and results of operations.



Seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels, since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling
periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. We must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. If we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to
sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which in each case may further adversely affect profitability.

Our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions.

Our continued growth and success will
depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis. Accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including the
ability to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel, particularly at the store management level, and the integration of new stores into existing operations. There can be no
assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably.

Our plans for international expansion include risks that could adversely impact our growth.

We intend to further expand into international markets. The risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our
brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. In addition, we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners for our international expansion. Further, entry into this market may
bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence. We cannot ensure the profitability of our expansion into international markets. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.

Our licensees could take actions that could harm our business or brand images.

We have global representation through independently owned La Senza stores operating under license agreements. Although we have criteria to evaluate and screen prospective
licensees, the amount of control we can exercise over our licensees is limited and the quality of licensed operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Licensees may not have the business acumen or financial resources
necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. Our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our
licensees do not operate successfully.

Our direct channel business includes risks that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results from operations.

Our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operational results.
Risks include, but are not limited to the (a) diversion of sales from our stores, which may impact comparable store sales figures, (b) difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through our direct channels, (c) domestic or
international resellers purchasing merchandise and re-selling it overseas outside our control and (d) risks related to the failure of the systems that operate the web sites and their related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of
customer information, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. Any of these events could adversely affect our business.

In August 2007, we opened a new distribution center for our Victoria’s Secret Direct business that includes new systems, material handling equipment and processes. The ramp-up of the new distribution center to full capacity has been
very challenging and has resulted in significant delays in shipping and incurrence of additional costs. We expect to continue to incur additional costs into 2008 as a result of these operational challenges.



Our failure to protect our reputation could have an adverse effect on our brand images.

Our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images. Our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality
and integrity. Any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities or adverse publicity regarding
our responses to these concerns could also jeopardize our reputation. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could
also hurt our reputation. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources
to rebuild our reputation.

Our failure to adequately protect our trade names and trademarks could have a negative impact on our brand images and limit
our ability to penetrate new markets.

We believe that our trade names and trademarks are an essential element of our strategy. We have obtained or
applied for federal registration of these trade names and trademarks and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries in which our manufacturers are located. There can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or
that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. If any third party copies our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative
connotation, our brand images could be materially adversely affected.

Our results can be adversely affected by market disruptions.

Market disruptions due to severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards, terrorist activities or the prospect of these events can affect consumer spending
and confidence levels and adversely affect our results or prospects in affected markets. The receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to fully offset our losses.

Our stock price may be volatile.

Our stock price may
fluctuate substantially as a result of our quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of other companies in the retail industry or the markets we serve. In addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume
fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies.

Our failure to maintain our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital.

The credit ratings
agencies have periodically reviewed our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for
our operations. We are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. If our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained, our interest costs will likely increase, our
financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected.

We may be unable to service our debt.

We may be unable to service our outstanding debt or any other debt we incur. Additionally, some of our debt related agreements require maintenance of certain financial
ratios which limit the total amount we may borrow and also prohibit certain types of liens on property or assets.

Our ability to compete favorably in
our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could negatively impact our results.

The sale of intimate and other apparel, personal care
products and accessories is highly competitive. We compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores



and discount retailers. In addition to the traditional store-based retailers, we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of
merchandise and who target customers through e-commerce and catalogues. Brand image, marketing, design, price, service, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and direct response channels.

Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available. In many cases, our competitors sell their products in
department stores that are located in the same shopping malls as our stores. In addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls.

Increased competition could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could
negatively impact our results.

Our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion
preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings far in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. Customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly. If we are unable to
successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. In
response, we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our brand image may also suffer if customers believe merchandise misjudgments indicate we are no longer
able to identify and offer the latest fashions.

We may be unable to retain key personnel.

It is our belief we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives, including Leslie H. Wexner (Chairman of the Board of
Directors and Chief Executive Officer). The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. Competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success
will also depend on our ability to recruit, train and retain other qualified key personnel.

We may be unable to attract, develop and retain qualified
employees and manage labor costs.

We believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive, engaging and satisfying experience for each individual
customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees. Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store personnel. The turnover rate in the
retail industry is high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. Competition for such qualified individuals could require us to pay higher wages to attract a
sufficient number of employees. Our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand. Delayed store openings, significant increases in
employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We rely significantly on foreign sources of production and maintenance of operations in foreign countries.

We
purchase intimate apparel merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the domestic market, some of which is manufactured overseas. We do not have any material long-term merchandise supply contracts. Many of our imports are subject to a variety of
customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or safeguard quotas. We compete with other companies for production facilities.



We also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing
merchandise from abroad, such as:

•

political instability;

•

imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports;

•

legal and regulatory matters;

•

currency and exchange risks;

•

local business practice and political issues, including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards which may result in adverse
publicity;

•

potential delays or disruptions in shipping and related pricing impacts;

•

disruption of imports by labor disputes; and

•

changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation.

New initiatives may be proposed impacting the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which, if enacted, would limit or reduce the products purchased from
suppliers in such countries.

In addition, significant health hazards, environmental hazards or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative
effect on the economies, financial markets and business activity. Our purchase of merchandise from these manufacturing operations may be affected by this risk.

Our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and may have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner and meet quality standards.

We purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from third-party manufacturers. Similar to most other specialty retailers, we have narrow sales window periods for much of our inventory. Factors outside our
control, such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
and results of operations.

Our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price of oil.

Prices of oil have fluctuated dramatically in the past. These fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our
retail stores and costs to purchase product from our manufacturers. A continual rise in oil prices could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We may be adversely impacted by increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing.

Postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings. We rely on
discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. Future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to pass such increases directly onto our customers or by
implementing more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems.



We significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems.

Our success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. Our computer systems as well as those of our service
providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security measures, some of our servers and those of our service providers are
potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Additionally, these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer information which could result in damage to our
reputation and/or litigation. Despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems. Sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process orders and
deliver products to the stores in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, controls and reporting.

In addition, we are currently implementing modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for merchandise, sourcing, distribution, e-commerce and support systems, including finance. Modifications
involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data
and system disruptions. The launch of these successor systems will take place in a phased approach over an approximate five year period that began in 2005. Information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated,
could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

We may fail to comply with regulatory requirements.

As a public company, we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. Our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable laws
and regulations, including those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse
effect on our reputation, financial condition and on the market price of our common stock.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

Not applicable.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

The following table provides the location, use and size of our distribution, corporate and product
development facilities as of February 2, 2008:



United States

Our business is principally conducted from office, distribution and shipping facilities located in the Columbus, Ohio area. Additional facilities are located in New York, New York; Kettering, Ohio; Rio Rancho, New Mexico and Paramus, New
Jersey.

Our distribution and shipping facilities consist of seven buildings located in the Columbus, Ohio area. These buildings, including attached office
space, comprise approximately 6.4 million square feet.

As of February 2, 2008, we operate 2,614 retail stores located in leased facilities,
primarily in malls and shopping centers, throughout the United States. A substantial portion of these lease commitments consist of store leases generally with an initial term of ten years. The leases expire at various dates between 2008 and 2024.

Typically, when space is leased for a retail store in a shopping center, we supply all improvements, including interior walls, floors, ceilings, fixtures
and decorations. The cost of improvements varies widely, depending on the design, size and location of the store. In certain cases, the landlord of the property may provide an allowance to fund all or a portion of the cost of improvements serving as
a lease incentive. Rental terms for new locations usually include a fixed minimum rent plus a percentage of sales in excess of a specified amount. We usually pay certain operating costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, insurance and
taxes. For additional information, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

International

Canada

Our
international business is principally conducted from owned and leased office, distribution and shipping facilities located in the Montreal, Quebec area. Additional leased office facilities are located in Toronto, Ontario.

Our distribution and shipping facilities consist of two buildings located in the Montreal, Quebec area. These buildings, including attached office space, comprise
approximately 324,000 square feet. Additionally, we lease additional office facilities in the Montreal area comprised of approximately 100,000 square feet.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

We are a defendant in a variety of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business.
Plaintiffs may seek to recover large and sometimes unspecified amounts or other types of relief and some matters may remain unresolved for several years. Although we are unable to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any litigation, in the
opinion of management, our legal proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

Not applicable.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

Our
common stock (“LTD”) is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. On February 2, 2008, there were approximately 75,000 shareholders of record. However, including active associates who participate in our stock purchase plan, associates
who own shares through our sponsored retirement plans and others holding shares in broker accounts under street names, we estimate the shareholder base to be approximately 175,000.

The following table provides our quarterly market prices and cash dividends per share for 2007 and 2006:



The following graph shows the changes, over the past five-year period, in the value of $100 invested in our common stock,
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Price Index and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Retail Composite Index. The plotted points represent the closing price on the last day of the fiscal year indicated.

The following table provides our repurchases of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2007:

(a)

The total number of shares repurchased primarily includes shares repurchased as part of publicly announced programs, with the remainder relating to shares repurchased in connection
with (i) tax payments due upon vesting of employee restricted stock awards, and (ii) the use of our stock to pay the exercise price on employee stock options.

(b)

The average price paid per share includes any broker commissions.

(c)

For additional share repurchase program information, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.



ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.

(a)

Fifty-three week fiscal year.

(b)

On January 29, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”), which
requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date. For additional information, see Notes 2 and 17 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.



The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 123(R) was $0.7 million, net of tax of $0.4 million, and was
recognized as an increase to net income in the Consolidated Statement of Income as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2006.

(c)

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we changed our inventory valuation method. Previously, inventories were principally valued at the lower of cost or market, on a weighted-average
cost basis, using the retail method. Commencing in 2005, inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or market, on a weighted-average cost basis, using the cost method. For additional information, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The cumulative effect of this change was $17
million, net of tax of $11 million. This change was recognized as an increase to net income in the Consolidated Statement of Income as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2005. In addition to the $17 million cumulative impact recognized as of
the beginning of the first quarter, the effect of the change during 2005 was to decrease net income by $4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share.

(d)

Operating income includes the effect of the following items:

(i)

income for unredeemed gift cards at Victoria’s Secret, $53 million of expense related to various restructuring activities and $37 million of gains related to asset sales. For additional information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data;

(ii)

(e)

In addition to the items previously discussed in (d), net income includes the effect of the following items:

(i)

In 2007, a $100 million pretax gain related to a distribution from Easton Town Center, LLC, a $17 million pretax gain related to an interest rate hedge and $67 million of favorable
tax benefits primarily relating to: 1) the reversal of state net operating loss carryforward valuation allowances and other favorable tax benefits associated with the Apparel divestitures; 2) a decline in the Canadian federal tax rate; 3) audit
settlements and 4) other items. For additional information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data;

(ii)

In 2005, a $77 million favorable one-time tax benefit related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act and $40 million of

(iv)

In 2003, pretax non-operating gains of $208 million related to Alliance Data Systems Corporation (“ADS”).

(f)

In 2004, dividends per share include a special dividend of $1.23 per share.

(g)

A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable store sales when it has been open or owned 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of
20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.

The following discussion
and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following
information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Executive Overview

Strategy

Our
strategy supports and drives our mission to build a family of the world’s best fashion retail brands whose well-told stories create loyal customers and deliver sustained growth for our stakeholders.

To execute our strategy, we are focused on these key strategic imperatives:

•

Grow our core brands in current channels and geographies;

•

Extend our core brands into larger footprints and new channels and geographies;

•

Incubate and grow new brands in current channels;

•

Build enabling infrastructure and capabilities;

•

Become the top destination for talent;

•

Proactive management of our capital structure.

2007 Overview

Overall, we were disappointed with our financial performance in 2007. However, we did accomplish much in terms of the
execution of our business strategy including:

•

The full stabilization of our new supply chain systems at Bath & Body Works;

•

The integration of La Senza, which we acquired at the end of 2006;

•

The divestiture of a majority ownership interest in both Express and Limited Stores;

•

The realignment and resizing of our organization structure and the resulting reduction in our workforce;

•

The recapitalization of the business including the issuance of an additional $1.25 billion in debt and the repurchase of $1.4 billion of our common shares;

•

The opening of a new distribution center for Victoria’s Secret Direct.

In addition to the changes outlined above, we also were faced with a number of other challenges during 2007. First, disappointing product launches and a downturn in the retail environment put significant pressure on
our gross profit. As a result, we took actions to reduce our retail inventories by 25% per square foot to minimize our financial risk as we enter 2008. Second, it took longer than expected to bring our new Victoria’s Secret distribution
center for direct channel business up to capacity, resulting in significant incremental costs during the second half of the year. As a result of the distribution center challenges, we were forced to take actions to reduce the volume of orders in the
fourth quarter to protect the customer experience while we worked through the issues. In summary, we experienced a number of transformational changes in 2007. However, we believe that these changes have prepared us to enter 2008 in a better position
to focus on the growth and financial performance of our brands.



Results of Operations

Summary of 2007

Our operating results are generally impacted by changes in the overall U.S. economy and, therefore, we monitor the retail
environment using, among other things, certain key industry performance indicators such as the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (which measures consumers’ views on the future course of the U.S. economy), the National Retail
Traffic Index (which measures traffic levels in approximately 1,500 malls nationwide) and National Retail Sales (which reflects sales volumes of 5,000 businesses as measured by the U.S. Census Bureau). These indices provide insight into consumer
spending patterns and shopping behavior in the current retail environment and assist us in assessing our performance as well as the potential impact of industry trends on our future operating results. Additionally, we evaluate a number of key
performance indicators including comparable store sales, gross profit, operating income and other performance metrics such as sales per average selling square foot and inventory per selling square foot in assessing our performance.

Operating Income – 2007 and 2006

The following table provides
our segment operating income (loss) and operating income rates (expressed as a percentage of net sales) for 2007 in comparison to 2006:

(a)

Express and Limited Stores were divested in July 2007 and August 2007, respectively. Operating income for Apparel for 2007 includes a $302 million gain on divestiture related to
Express and a $72 million loss on divestiture related to Limited Stores.

(b)

Includes Corporate (including non-core real estate, equity investments and other administrative functions such as treasury and tax), Mast (an apparel importer which is a significant
supplier of merchandise for Victoria’s Secret), Beauty Avenues (a personal care sourcing Company serving both Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works) and Henri Bendel.

For 2007, operating income decreased 6% to $1.110 billion and the operating income rate remained flat at 11.0%. The changes in operating income in 2007 were primarily
driven by the following:

Victoria’s Secret

In 2007, Victoria’s Secret’s operating income decreased 19% to $772 million primarily driven by:

•

Decreased operating income at Victoria’s Secret Stores primarily in the first half of 2007 as we responded to softness in sales by executing promotions and
taking markdowns in certain merchandise categories to drive traffic;

•

Decreased operating income at Victoria’s Secret Stores primarily related to the 53

rd

week included in 2006 results and a merchandise assortment that did not overcome the challenging economic environment in 2007;

•

Decreased operating income at Victoria’s Secret Direct in the second half of 2007 as a result of operational limitations and increased costs associated with
our new distribution center. We opened the new distribution center for the Direct business in August 2007 and it has taken longer than expected to reach planned



capacity levels. As a result, net sales for Victoria’s Secret Direct decreased due to shipping delays to customers and as a result of our decision to
constrain the volume of customer orders to protect the customer experience. Operating income was also negatively impacted by the increased costs related to stabilizing the distribution center;

•

Increased buying and occupancy expenses driven by real estate expansion activities;

Offset partially by:

•

The initial recognition of gift card breakage at Victoria’s Secret of $48 million and the inclusion of La Senza’s operating income for the full year in
2007.

The operating income rate decreased to 13.8% from 18.6% driven by a decline in the gross profit rate due to the factors cited
above and deleverage of the general, administrative and store operating expense rate.

Bath & Body Works

In 2007, Bath & Body Works’ operating income decreased 28% to $330 million primarily driven by a decline in net sales consistent with declines in traffic.
We responded to the decline in traffic with promotional activities and other initiatives to drive sales, which caused a decrease in gross profit. The operating income rate decreased to 13.2% from 17.8% as a result.

Apparel

In 2007, Apparel operating income increased
significantly to $259 million primarily due to a pretax gain of $302 million associated with the divestiture of 75% of our ownership interest in Express. On July 6, 2007, we completed the divestiture of 75% of our ownership interest in Express
to affiliates of Golden Gate Capital for pretax net cash proceeds of $547 million.

The Express gain was partially offset by a pretax loss of $72 million
associated with the divestiture of 75% of our ownership interest in Limited Stores. On August 3, 2007, we completed the divestiture of 75% of our ownership interest in Limited Stores to affiliates of Sun Capital. As part of the agreement, Sun
Capital contributed $50 million in equity capital to the business and arranged a $75 million credit facility.

Our remaining investments in Express and
Limited Stores are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, we recorded 25% Express and Limited Stores results subsequent to the divestiture date as Other Income (Loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

In conjunction with the divestitures, we entered into transition services agreements with Express and Limited Stores whereby we provide support to them in various
operational areas including merchandise sourcing, logistics and technology. The merchandise sourcing arrangement with Mast does have an impact on our segment operating results. Prior to the divestitures, Mast’s sales to Express and Limited
Stores were eliminated in consolidation. Subsequent to the divestitures, we recognize 75% of those sales, resulting in an increase in Other sales. The gross profit associated with these sourcing sales is at a lower rate than the gross profit on the
Apparel retail sales we recognized prior to the divestiture.

Other

In 2007, the Other operating loss decreased 5% to $251 million primarily driven by the impact of the realignment and resizing of our organization structure. During the second quarter of 2007, we initiated a
restructuring program designed to resize our corporate infrastructure and to adjust for the impact of the Apparel divestitures. This program resulted in the elimination of approximately 500 positions (or 10%) of our corporate and home



office headcount through position eliminations and transfers to Express and Limited Stores. Although this initiative resulted in severance and other costs
totaling $38 million in the second quarter, it provided expense reductions in the second half of the year. Additionally, we recognized gains of $25 million in the third quarter related to the sale of corporate aircraft.

Fourth Quarter of 2007 Compared to Fourth Quarter of 2006

The
following table provides our segment operating income (loss) and operating income rates (expressed as a percentage of net sales) for the fourth quarter of 2007 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2006:

(b)

Includes Corporate, Mast, Beauty Avenues and Henri Bendel.

Not meaningful

For the fourth quarter of 2007, operating income
decreased 14% to $621 million and the operating income rate increased to 19.0% from 18.1%. The change in operating income in the fourth quarter of 2007 was primarily driven by the following:

Victoria’s Secret

For the fourth quarter of 2007,
Victoria’s Secret’s operating income decreased 8% to $370 million primarily driven by:

•

Decreased operating income at Victoria’s Secret Direct as a result of operational limitations and increased costs associated with our new distribution center;

•

Decreased operating income at Victoria’s Secret Stores primarily related to the 53

rd

week included in 2006 results and a merchandise assortment that did not overcome the challenging economic environment in 2007;

•

Increased buying and occupancy expenses driven by real estate expansion activities;

Offset partially by:

•

The initial recognition of gift card breakage at Victoria’s Secret of $48 million;

•

The inclusion of La Senza’s operating income for the full quarter in 2007.

The operating income rate declined to 19.5% from 21.7% as a result of the factors cited above.

Bath & Body Works

For the fourth quarter of 2007,
Bath & Body Works’ operating income decreased 10% to $301 million which is consistent with a decline in net sales. The decline in net sales was due to continued challenges in traffic and disappointing holiday and semi-annual sale
performance. The operating income rate declined to 27.9% from 28.7% driven by the impact of lower net sales on the gross profit rate partially offset by a modest decrease in general, administrative and store operating expenses.



Other

For the
fourth quarter of 2007, the Other operating loss decreased 12% to $50 million primarily driven by lower incentive compensation offset by increased technology costs.

Store Data

The following tables compare 2007 store data to the comparable periods for 2006 and 2005:

(a)

La Senza was acquired on January 12, 2007.

(b)

The following table compares fourth quarter of 2007 comparable store sales to fourth quarter of 2006:

(a)

Express and Limited Stores were divested in July 2007 and August 2007, respectively.



For the fourth quarter of 2007, our net sales decreased 19% to $3.276 billion and comparable store sales decreased 8%.
The decrease in our net sales was primarily driven by the following:

Victoria’s Secret

For the fourth quarter of 2007, net sales increased 2% to $1.893 billion and comparable store sales decreased 8%. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by:

•

Inclusion of La Senza’s net sales for the full quarter in 2007; and

•

Initial recognition of gift card breakage at Victoria’s Secret of $48 million;

Offset partially by:

•

A decrease at Victoria’s Secret Direct as a result of the actions we undertook to constrain customer orders due to the operational issues associated with the
new distribution center; and

•

A decrease at Victoria’s Secret Stores primarily related to the 53

rd

week included in 2006 results and a merchandise assortment that did not overcome the challenging economic environment in 2007.

The decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by decreases across most categories, including core lingerie and beauty offset by modest increases in the
Pink sub-brand and sleepwear. The decreases resulted from product assortment misses and a merchandise assortment that did not overcome the challenging economic environment during the fourth quarter of 2007.

Bath & Body Works

For the fourth quarter of 2007,
net sales decreased 8% to $1.080 billion and comparable store sales decreased 8%. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by:

•

Softness in mall traffic and the overall economic environment;

•

A lack of newness in product assortment; and

•

Prolonged holiday discounting that negatively affected the performance of the semi-annual sale.

Other

For the fourth quarter of 2007, net sales increased 25%
to $303 million primarily driven by an increase in third-party customer sales at Mast due to the divestitures of Express and Limited Stores during the second quarter of 2007. Subsequent to the divestitures, 75% of Mast sales to Express and Limited
Stores are included in third-party customer sales while the remaining 25% are eliminated in consolidation consistent with our ownership interest.

Gross
Profit

For the fourth quarter of 2007, our gross profit decreased 19% to $1.304 billion and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net
sales) decreased to 39.8% from 40.1% primarily driven by the following:

Victoria’s Secret

For the fourth quarter of 2007, gross profit decreased primarily driven by:

•

A decrease in merchandise margin at Victoria’s Secret Direct due to the actions we undertook to constrain customer orders; and

•

A decrease in merchandise margin associated with decreased net sales at Victoria’s Secret Stores and increased buying and occupancy expenses associated with
the real estate expansion activities;



Offset partially by:

•

Initial recognition of gift card breakage of $48 million; and

•

Inclusion of La Senza’s gross profit for the full quarter in 2007.

The gross profit rate decreased driven primarily by deleverage of buying and occupancy expenses due to the Victoria’s Secret Stores real estate expansion activities and inclusion of La Senza’s results for
the full quarter in 2007.

Bath & Body Works

For the fourth quarter of 2007, gross profit decreased primarily driven by lower net sales. The gross profit rate decreased driven by a modest decline in the merchandise margin rate related to promotional activity to clear seasonal
merchandise and deleverage in the buying and occupancy expense rate associated with the decline in net sales.

General, Administrative and Store
Operating Expenses

For the fourth quarter of 2007, our general, administrative and store operating expenses decreased 23% to $682 million primarily
driven by the Apparel divestitures. The general, administrative and store operating expense rate decreased to 20.8% from 22.0% primarily driven by the net impact of the Apparel divestitures, including the recognition of Mast net sales to Express and
Limited Stores. The rate also benefited from the initial recognition of gift card breakage at Victoria’s Secret and lower incentive compensation and marketing expense.

Interest Income

For the fourth quarter of 2007, our
interest income increased $2 million to $6 million. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in average invested cash balances partially offset by a decrease in average effective interest rates.

Other Income (Loss)

For the fourth quarter of 2007, our other income
(loss) increased $9 million to $10 million. The increase was primarily driven by income from our equity investment in Express. We divested 75% of Express in July 2007 and retained the remaining 25% as an equity method investment.

Provision for Income Taxes

For the fourth quarter of 2007, our
effective tax rate decreased to 34.2% from 37.7%. The decline in the rate resulted from a decline in the Canadian federal tax rate, the finalization of income taxes related to the Apparel divestitures, audit settlements and other items.

For 2007, our net sales decreased 5% to $10.134 billion and comparable store sales decreased 2%. The decrease in our net
sales was primarily driven by the following:

Victoria’s Secret

For 2007, net sales increased 9% to $5.607 billion and comparable store sales decreased 2%. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the inclusion of La Senza net sales for the full year in 2007. The decrease
in comparable store sales was primarily driven by decreases across most categories, including core lingerie and beauty offset by modest increases in the Pink sub-brand and sleepwear. The decreases resulted from product assortment misses and a
merchandise assortment that did not overcome the challenging economic environment in 2007.

Bath & Body Works

For 2007, net sales decreased 2% to $2.494 billion and comparable store sales decreased 4%. The decrease in net sales and comparable store sales was primarily driven by
declines in store traffic experienced throughout the year and, in particular, during the fourth quarter which resulted in disappointing holiday and semi-annual sale performance.

Apparel

For 2007, net sales decreased 61% to $870 million as a result of the divestitures of Express and
Limited Stores in the second quarter of 2007. Prior to the divestitures, comparable store sales increased 5%.

Other

For 2007, net sales increased by 58% to $1.163 billion primarily driven by an increase in third-party customer sales at Mast due to the divestitures of Express and
Limited Stores during the second quarter of 2007. Subsequent to the divestitures, 75% of Mast sales to Express and Limited Stores are included in third-party customer sales while the remaining 25% are eliminated consistent with our ownership
interest.

Gross Profit

For 2007, our gross profit
decreased 12% to $3.542 billion and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 35.0% from 37.6% primarily driven by the following:

Victoria’s Secret

For 2007, gross profit decreased primarily driven by the following:

•

A decrease in gross profit at Victoria’s Secret Stores driven primarily by increases in buying and occupancy expenses related to real estate expansion
activities; and

•

A decrease in gross profit at Victoria’s Secret Direct driven primarily by the operational limitations affecting the new distribution center;

Partially offset by:

•

Inclusion of La Senza’s gross profit for the full year in 2007.

The gross profit rate decreased driven primarily by deleverage of buying and occupancy expenses and a decline in the merchandise margin rate associated with promotional activities and markdowns on certain categories
in response to soft sales trends.



Bath & Body Works

For 2007, gross profit decreased primarily driven by the decline in net sales. The gross profit rate decreased driven by a decline in the merchandise margin rate due to increased promotional activities designed to
drive traffic.

Apparel

For 2007, gross profit
decreased as a result of the divestitures of Express and Limited Stores in the second quarter of 2007.

General, Administrative and Store Operating
Expenses

For 2007, our general, administrative and store operating expenses decreased 6% to $2.662 billion primarily driven by the Apparel
divestitures, cost reductions realized in the second half of the year associated with our second quarter restructuring program and gains from the sale of corporate aircraft. These decreases were partially offset by the charges recognized primarily
in the second quarter of 2007 related to the restructuring program, increased costs at Victoria’s Secret Direct related to the new distribution center and the inclusion of La Senza’s general, administrative and store operating expenses for
the full year in 2007. The general, administrative and store operating expense rate decreased to 26.3% from 26.6% primarily driven by the net impact of the Apparel divestitures, including the recognition of Mast net sales to Express and Limited
Stores.

For 2007, interest expense increased $47 million to $149 million. The increase was primarily driven by an increase

Interest Income

For 2007, interest income decreased $7 million to
$18 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in average invested cash balances.

Other Income (Loss)

For 2007, other income (loss) increased $131 million to $128 million. The increase was primarily driven by a $100 million gain related to a distribution from Easton Town
Center, LLC (“ETC”), in which we have an equity investment, and income from our equity investment in Express. In July 2007, ETC refinanced its existing bank loan and distributed cash proceeds of $150 million to its members. As an ETC
member, we received approximately $102 million of proceeds resulting in a $100 million gain after reducing our ETC carrying value from $2 million to zero. In addition, we had a net gain of $17 million from the settlement of interest rate lock
agreements.



Minority Interest

For 2007, minority interest increased $21 million to $22 million. Minority interest represents the proportional share of net income or losses of consolidated, less than wholly-owned subsidiaries attributable to the minority interest
investor. The increase relates to losses from a personal care business acquired during the first quarter of 2007 and losses from an investment in an independent technology company focused on large multi-channel retailers.

Provision for Income Taxes

For 2007, our effective tax rate
decreased to 36.4% from 38.5%. The decline in the rate is primarily due to the reversal of state net operating loss carryforward valuation allowances in conjunction with the Apparel divestitures in the second quarter of 2007, a decline in the
Canadian federal tax rate, audit settlements and other items.

The following table compares fourth quarter of 2006 comparable store sales to fourth quarter of 2005:

For the fourth quarter of 2006, our net sales increased 14% to $4.025 billion and comparable store sales increased
8%. The increase in our net sales was primarily driven by the following:

Victoria’s Secret

For the fourth quarter of 2006, net sales increased 18% to $1.864 billion and comparable store sales increased 10%. The increase in net sales and comparable store sales
was primarily driven by:

•

An increase in the Pink sub-brand related to growth in loungewear, panties and accessories;

•

An increase in bras driven by new products featuring the Secret Embrace and Infinity Edge technologies;

•

An increase in the beauty category resulting from continued momentum of the Dream Angels Desire fragrance and the Beauty Rush color line; and

•

An 18% increase at Victoria’s Secret Direct driven by double digit growth in intimate apparel and clothing.

Bath & Body Works

For the fourth quarter of 2006,
net sales increased 12% to $1.175 billion and comparable store sales increased 9%. The increase in net sales and comparable store sales was primarily driven by:

•

An increase in the Signature Collection due to the introduction of new fragrances as well as strong sales performance during the extended semi-annual sale;

•

Incremental sales from the Temptations product line; and

•

Continued growth of the Dr. Wexler product line launched during the third quarter of 2005.

Apparel

For the fourth quarter of 2006, net sales remained
relatively flat at $744 million and comparable store sales increased 1% driven by a 3% increase at Express. The increase at Express was primarily due to increased sales in sweaters and woven tops, a strong clearance event and a favorable response to
early Spring merchandise. Limited Stores experienced a 4% decrease in comparable store sales, primarily driven by significant declines in woven tops and sweaters, offset partially by increases in jackets, skirts, woven shirts and dresses.

Other

For the fourth quarter of 2006, net
sales increased by 46% to $242 million primarily driven by an increase in Mast sales to third-party customers.



Gross Profit

For the
fourth quarter of 2006, our gross profit increased 12% to $1.612 billion and the gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of sales) decreased to 40.1% from 40.8% primarily driven by the following:

Victoria’s Secret

For the fourth quarter of 2006, gross
profit increased primarily driven by the increase in net sales. The gross profit rate decreased primarily due to a reduction in merchandise margin rates partially offset by an improvement in the buying and occupancy expense rate. The reduction in
merchandise margin rate was driven by increased markdowns due to the clearance of selected merchandise that missed sales expectations and increased levels of promotional direct mailings to drive an increase in market share. The merchandise margin
rate also declined partially due to a shift in the mix of business from core lingerie and beauty to Pink, loungewear and sleepwear and the expansion of multiple pricing offers for panties. Additionally, buying and occupancy expense was leveraged on
a 10% increase in comparable store sales.

Bath & Body Works

For the fourth quarter of 2006, gross profit increased primarily driven by the increase in net sales. The gross profit rate decreased compared to last year driven by a decrease in merchandise margin rate partially
offset by leverage in buying and occupancy. The reduction in merchandise margin rate to last year was driven by a mix of promotional transaction driving activity and better than expected performance of the semi-annual sale. Additionally, buying and
occupancy expense was leveraged on a 9% increase in comparable store sales.

Apparel

For the fourth quarter of 2006, gross profit and the gross profit rate increased primarily driven by improved merchandise margin at Express. The improvement in
merchandise margin rate was driven by lower product costs and reduced markdowns. Additionally, buying and occupancy expense was leveraged on a 1% increase in comparable store sales.

General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses

For the fourth quarter of 2006, our general, administrative and
store operating expenses increased 18% to $885 million and the general, administrative and store operating expense rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) increased to 22.0% from 21.2%. The increases in our general, administrative and store
operating expenses and the general, administrative and store operating expense rate were primarily driven by incremental spending on technology and process initiatives to support future growth, higher incentive compensation which is tied to improved
performance for the Fall season, and incremental stock option expense related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).

For the fourth quarter of 2006, our interest expense increased $3 million to $28 million. The increase was primarily
driven by an increase in average borrowings and the average borrowing rates resulting primarily from the issuance of commercial paper partially offset by a reduction in the bank facility fee from 0.15% to 0.10% of the committed amount per year.

Interest Income

For the fourth quarter of 2006, our
interest income decreased $45 million to $4 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a nonrecurring $40 million tax settlement in 2005. For additional information for the tax settlement, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Provision for Income Taxes

For the fourth quarter of 2006, our effective tax rate increased to 37.7% from 28.0%. The increase was primarily driven by a favorable one-time tax benefit of $77 million
related to the repatriation of foreign earnings that occurred in 2005 under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. The 2006 fourth quarter effective tax rate from on going operations decreased due to the resolution of certain state tax
matters. For additional information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The following table compares 2006 comparable store sales to the comparable periods for 2005:

For 2006, our net sales increased 10% to $10.671 billion and comparable store sales increased 7%. The increase in
our net sales and comparable store sales were primarily driven by the following:

Victoria’s Secret

For 2006, net sales increased 16% to $5.139 billion and comparable store sales increased 11%. The increases were driven by growth in all categories including core
lingerie, beauty and Pink. Net sales were supported by several bra launches throughout the year, including the Angels Secret Embrace, Body by Victoria IPEX Wireless, Very Sexy Infinity Edge Push-up and Secret Embrace Demi. The increase in the beauty
category was primarily driven by continued growth in the Garden body care line and incremental sales from beauty launches, including Very Sexy Make Up, Beauty Rush Lip Gloss and Eye Shadows and Dream Angels Desire fragrance. The 16% increase in
sales at Victoria’s Secret Direct was driven by growth across all major categories.

Bath & Body Works

For 2006, net sales increased 12% to $2.556 billion and comparable store sales increased 10%. The increase in net sales and comparable store sales were driven by
increases in the Signature Collection due to the introduction of new fragrances more frequently throughout the year. Additionally, incremental sales from the Temptations product line and continued growth in the Dr. Wexler, Antibacterial and
Breathe Body Care product lines contributed to sales growth.

Apparel

For 2006, net sales decreased 4% to $2.242 billion and comparable store sales decreased 2%. The decrease in net sales and comparable store sales were driven by declines during the first three quarters of the year. At
Express,



these results reflect the impact of the significant promotional and clearance activity that occurred in 2005. The 4% decline in Limited Stores comparable
store sales was driven by declines in pants, sweaters and woven tops, partially offset by increases in dresses, jackets and skirts.

Other

For 2006, net sales increased 17% to $734 million primarily driven by an increase in Mast sales to third-party customers in comparison to 2005.

Gross Profit

For 2006, our gross profit increased 15% to $4.013
billion and the gross profit rate increased to 37.6% from 35.9% primarily driven by the following:

Victoria’s Secret

For 2006, gross profit increased primarily driven by the increase in net sales. The gross profit rate decreased due to a reduction in the merchandise margin rate driven
by markdowns associated with strategic marketing activities designed to drive trial, build brand loyalty and increase market share. The reduction in the merchandise margin rate was partially offset by buying and occupancy expense leverage achieved
on an 11% increase in comparable store sales.

Bath & Body Works

For 2006, gross profit increased primarily driven by the increase in net sales. The gross profit rate was flat compared to last year. The buying and occupancy expense rate improved, but was offset by a reduction in
the merchandise margin rate. The reduction in the merchandise margin rate was due to increased promotional activity to drive transactions and the performance of the semi-annual sale events. Buying and occupancy expense was leveraged on a 10%
increase in comparable store sales.

Apparel

For 2006, gross profit and the gross profit rate increased significantly over last year driven by lower product costs and reduced markdowns at Express. Additionally, buying and occupancy expense was leveraged despite the 2% decline in
comparable store sales.

General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses

For 2006, our general, administrative and store operating expenses increased 14% to $2.837 billion and the general, administrative and store operating expense rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) increased to
26.6% from 25.7%. The increases in our general, administrative and store operating expenses and the general, administrative and store operating expense rate were primarily driven by the following:

•

Increased marketing expenses primarily at Victoria’s Secret;

•

Increases in incentive compensation expense due to improved performance;

•

Investments in technology and process improvement initiatives to support future growth; and

•

Incremental stock compensation expense related to our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (R).

Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Provision for Income Taxes

For 2006, our effective tax rate increased to 38.5% from 30.4%. The rate increase was primarily due to a favorable one-time tax benefit of $77 million related to the
repatriation of foreign earnings that occurred in 2005 under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. The 2006 effective tax rate from on going operations decreased due to the resolution of certain state tax matters. For additional
information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.



FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining our financial stability. We are
committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. Cash generated from our operating activities provides the primary resources to support current operations, growth initiatives, seasonal funding requirements and capital expenditures. Our net income and,
consequently, our cash provided from operations are impacted by, among other things, sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, timing of new product introductions and profit margins. Sales are typically higher during the fourth quarter of the fiscal
year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, our need for working capital peaks during the summer and fall months as inventory builds in anticipation of the holiday period.

In addition, we have funds available from an unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) as well as a commercial paper program which is backed by the
Facility. For additional information, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

In 2007, we executed a number of transactions as part of our review and evaluation of our overall capital structure. In July 2007, we completed the following:

•

Issued $700 million of 10-year notes and $300 million of 30-year notes utilizing our existing shelf registration statement.

•

Amended our term loan agreement by increasing its capacity to $750 million and extending the term to August 2012. We borrowed an additional $250 million available
under the amended term loan.

•

Amended the $1 billion revolving credit facility by extending the term to August 2012 and executing a $500 million, 364-day revolving credit facility, increasing
the total revolving credit facility borrowing capacity to $1.5 billion.

We used a portion of the proceeds from these additional
borrowings to fund our share repurchases during the year, the acquisition of La Senza and for other general corporate requirements including repayment of our outstanding commercial paper issued during the first and second quarters of 2007.

On October 1, 2007, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement for an indeterminate amount of securities with the Securities Exchange
Commission. As of February 2, 2008, no securities have been issued under this registration statement.

We believe that available short-term and
long-term capital resources are sufficient to fund our capital expenditures, working capital requirements, scheduled debt payments, interest payments, income tax obligations, dividends to our shareholders, any contemplated strategic acquisitions and
share repurchases.

The following table provides a summary of our working capital position and capitalization as of February 2, 2008, February 3,
2007 and January 28, 2006:

The rating for each agency listed above represents the lowest rating to remain investment grade, as defined by
each agency’s respective methodology. If we receive an upgrade from any of the rating agencies listed above, our borrowing costs could decrease. If we receive a downgrade in our credit ratings by any of the rating agencies listed above, our
borrowing costs could increase and the availability of credit could be negatively affected. A downgrade in our ratings by one or both agencies would not accelerate the repayment of any of our debt.

Dividend Policy and Procedures

We currently pay a common stock
dividend of $0.15 per share in cash each quarter. Our Board of Directors will determine future dividends after giving consideration to our profit levels, operating cash flow levels and capital requirements, as well as financial and other business
conditions existing at the time.

Cash Flow

The
following table provides a summary of our cash flow activity for the fiscal years ended February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006:

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities in 2007 was $765 million consisting primarily of net income of $718 million. Net income included (a) depreciation and amortization, (b) the $302 million gain on
divestiture of



Express, and (c) the $100 million gain on distribution from Easton Town Center, LLC. Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a
current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant working capital change was a $337 million increase in operating cash flow associated with inventories. Inventory levels decreased compared to 2006 due to a
concerted effort to control and reduce inventory levels across the enterprise and due to reductions in safety stocks at Bath & Body Works that increased during 2006 in connection with the 2006 supply chain system conversion. Accounts
receivable increased due to the Apparel divestitures and the resulting increase in Mast third party sales to Express and Limited Stores.

Net cash provided
by operating activities in 2006 was $600 million consisting primarily of net income of $676 million. Net income included noncash expense items primarily for depreciation and amortization. Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that
had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant working capital change was a $545 million decrease in operating cash flow associated with inventories. We increased inventory levels during the year to
meet the following objectives: (a) at Victoria’s Secret, increases related to new product launches in core lingerie and beauty, initiatives to increase market share and build brand loyalty and an initiative to improve in-stock inventory
positions and (b) at Bath & Body Works, increases related primarily to investments in safety stocks of seasonless basics in anticipation of the supply chain system conversion that occurred mid-year as well as an initiative to improve
in-stock inventory positions.

Net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was $1.081 billion consisting primarily of net income of $683 million. Net
income included noncash expense items primarily for depreciation and amortization. Other changes in assets and liabilities represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital. The most significant working
capital item was a $92 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other.

Investing Activities

Net cash provided by investing activities in 2007 was $30 million consisting primarily of (a) $547 million of proceeds from the divestiture of Express, (b) $102
million of proceeds from a distribution from Easton Town Center, LLC, and (c) $97 million of proceeds related to the sale of assets, offset by $749 million of capital expenditures. The capital expenditures included $476 million for opening new
stores and remodeling and improving existing stores. Remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to investments in our new distribution center and increased spending on home office, technology and infrastructure.

Net cash used for investing activities in 2006 was $1.093 billion consisting primarily of $572 million related to the acquisition of La Senza and $548 million of capital
expenditures. The capital expenditures included $311 million for opening new stores and remodeling and improving existing stores. Remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to investments in new growth concepts and increased spending on
technology and infrastructure to support growth.

Net cash used for investing activities in 2005 was $506 million consisting primarily of $480 million of
capital expenditures. The capital expenditures included $298 million for opening new stores and remodeling and improving existing stores. Remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to investments in new growth concepts and increased
spending on technology and infrastructure to support growth. In addition, we invested $22 million in strategic investments in several personal care companies and $4 million in non-operating real estate investments.

We anticipate spending approximately $575 to $600 million for capital expenditures in 2008 with the majority relating to opening new stores and remodeling and improving
existing stores. We expect to open approximately 175 new stores and to close approximately 40 stores. Our new stores will be primarily Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works. Additional spending will relate to investments in
technology initiatives, investments in home office and other investments. We expect 2008 capital expenditures will be funded principally by net cash provided by operating activities.



Financing Activities

Net cash used for financing activities in 2007 was $279 million consisting primarily of (a) cash payments of $1.4 billion related to the repurchase of 59 million shares of common stock during the year at a weighted-average price
of $24.01 under our June 2006, June 2007, August 2007 and November 2007 share repurchase programs and (b) quarterly dividend payments of $0.15 per share, or $227 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by (a) debt
offering proceeds of $997 million, (b) proceeds from the term loan refinancing of $250 million and (c) the exercise of stock options of $74 million.

Net cash used for financing activities in 2006 was $215 million consisting primarily (a) cash payments of $193 million related to the repurchase of 8 million shares of common stock during the year at a weighted-average price of
$24.98 under our November 2005, February 2006 and June 2006 share repurchase programs and (b) quarterly dividend payments of $0.15 per share, or $238 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock
options of $153 million and excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $46 million.

Net cash used for financing activities in 2005 was $528
million consisting primarily of (a) cash payments of $380 million related to the repurchase of 17 million shares of common stock during the year at a weighted-average price of $22.49 under our February, May, August and November 2005 share
repurchase programs and (b) quarterly dividend payments of $0.15 per share, or $242 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $64 million and a $30 million draw on a line of credit at
Mast.

Contingent Liabilities and Contractual Obligations

The following table provides our contractual obligations, aggregated by type, including the maturity profile as of February 2, 2008:

(a)

Long-term debt obligations relate to our principal and interest payments for outstanding notes, debentures and Term Loan and line of credit borrowings. Interest payments have been
estimated based on the coupon rate for fixed rate obligations and the variable rate, including the impact of the participating interest rate swap arrangement, in effect as of February 2, 2008 for the Term Loan. Interest obligations exclude
amounts which have been accrued through February 2, 2008. For additional information, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

(b)

Operating lease obligations primarily represent minimum payments due under store lease agreements. For additional information, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

(c)

Purchase obligations primarily include purchase orders for merchandise inventory and other agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that
specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.

(d)

Other liabilities primarily includes future payments relating to our nonqualified supplemental retirement plan and have been reflected under “Other” as
the timing of these future payments is not known until an



associate leaves the company or otherwise requests an in-service distribution. In addition, Other Liabilities also includes future estimated payments
associated with unrecognized tax benefits as accounted for under Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” The “Less Than 1 Year” category includes $18 million
because it is reasonably possible that the payments could change in the next twelve months due to audit settlements of resolution or uncertainties. The remaining portion is included in the “Other” category as the timing and amount of these
payments is not known until the matters are resolved with relevant tax authorities. For additional information, see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

In connection with the disposition of certain businesses, we have remaining guarantees of approximately $274 million related to lease
payments of Express, Limited Stores, Abercrombie & Fitch, Tween Brands Inc. (formerly Limited Too and Too, Inc.), Dick’s Sporting Goods (formerly Galyan’s), Lane Bryant, New York & Company and Anne.x under the current
terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through 2017. These guarantees include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses, and relate to leases that commenced prior to the
disposition of the businesses. In certain instances, our guarantee may remain in effect if the term of a lease is extended. We believe the likelihood of material liability being triggered under these guarantees is remote.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Other than those disclosed, we have
no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation 229.303 Item 303 (a) (4).

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS 161 “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 161”)

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS 161, which requires disclosures about the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains or losses in tabular format as well as
disclosures regarding credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements, counterparty credit risk and strategies and objectives for using derivative instruments. SFAS 161 amends and expands SFAS 133 and is effective prospectively
beginning in 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact to our financial statements.

SFAS 141 (revised 2007) “Business Combinations”
(“SFAS 141(R)”)

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS 141(R), which establishes how the
acquiring entity recognizes and measures the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any gain on bargain purchases and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. SFAS 141(R) requires acquisition-related costs to be expensed in the
periods they are incurred, with the exception of the costs to issue debt or equity securities. SFAS 141(R) requires disclosure of information for a business combination that occurs during the accounting period or prior to the issuance of the
financial statements for the accounting period. SFAS 141(R) is effective prospectively for business combinations with an acquisition date on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period after December 15, 2008. We are
currently evaluating the impact to our financial statements.

SFAS 160 “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements”
(“SFAS 160”)

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160, which modifies reporting for noncontrolling interest (minority interest) in
consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 requires noncontrolling interest be reported in equity and establishes a new framework for recognizing net income or loss and comprehensive income by the controlling interest. SFAS 160 requires
specific disclosures regarding changes in equity interest of both the controlling and noncontrolling parties and presentation of the noncontrolling equity balance and income or loss for all periods presented. SFAS 160 is effective for interim
and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The statement is applied prospectively upon adoption. Upon adoption, prior period financial statements will be restated for the presentation of the noncontrolling
interest for comparability. We are currently evaluating the impact to our financial statements.



SFAS 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”)

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159 permitting entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair
value. The standard also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparison between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. If the fair value
option is elected, the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value is reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The statement is applied prospectively upon adoption. We do not plan to elect
fair value treatment for any assets or liabilities under SFAS 159 as of the beginning of 2008.

SFAS 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS
157”)

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, which provides guidance for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and instruments
measured at fair value that are classified in shareholders’ equity. The statement defines fair value, establishes a fair value measurement framework and expands fair value disclosures. It emphasizes that fair value is market-based
with the highest measurement hierarchy level being market prices in active markets. The standard requires fair value measurements be disclosed by hierarchy level, an entity include its own credit standing in the measurement of its liabilities
and modifies the transaction price presumption.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-2 “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”
which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
recurring basis (at least annually). The provision of SFAS 157 is applied prospectively. We plan to adopt the required portions of SFAS 157 at the beginning of 2008 and do not expect a material impact to our financial statements. We
plan to adopt SFAS 157 at the beginning of 2009 for items within the scope of FSP FAS 157-2 and we are currently evaluating the impact of this portion to our financial statements.

Future Accounting Changes

The FASB’s standard-setting process is ongoing and until new standards have been
finalized and issued by FASB, we cannot determine the impact on the reporting of our operations and financial position that may result from any such future changes. The FASB is currently working on several projects including, but not limited to,
revenue recognition, liabilities and equity, derivatives disclosures, earnings per share calculations and leases. We also expect to see more FASB projects as a result of its desire to converge International Accounting Standards with GAAP. The
ultimate pronouncements resulting from these and future projects could have an impact on our future results of operations and financial position.

Impact of Inflation

Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to
accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management
evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, long-lived assets, claims and contingencies, income taxes and revenue recognition. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical
experience and various other



factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management has discussed the development
and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting its results of operations and financial
position.

Inventories

Inventories are principally
valued at the lower of cost or market, on a weighted-average cost basis.

We record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of specific
inventory items on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical
experience. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates.

We also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory. These estimates are
based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends.

Management does not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates
will change significantly based on prior experience. A 10% increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately $6 million for 2007. A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory
loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately $2 million for 2007.

Valuation of Long-lived Assets

Property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of the asset may not be recoverable. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, usually determined
by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset. Factors used in the valuation include, but are not limited to, management’s plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results and projected cash flows. When a
decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life.

Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. The impairment review is
performed by comparing each reporting unit’s carrying value to its estimated fair value. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value. Factors
used in the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets include, but are not limited to, management’s plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results and projected future cash flows. If future economic conditions are
different than those projected by management, impairment charges may be required.

Claims and Contingencies

We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. Our
determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency. We consult with legal counsel on matters related
to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts within and outside our organization with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. We accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the
amount is estimable. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible (as opposed to probable), or if an estimate is not determinable, disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.



Income Taxes

We
account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, the amount of taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
income tax rates is recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such
assets will not be realized.

Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and
liabilities. In determining our provision for income taxes, we use an annual effective income tax rate based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates. We adjust the annual effective income
tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available. Our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the
results of tax audits.

Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These
audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax
authorities. We record an accrual for more likely than not exposures after evaluating the positions associated with our various income tax filings. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is
audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual, the statute of
limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.

Although we believe that our
estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”, an Interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109. In May 2007, the FASB issued FSP FIN 48-1, “Definition of ‘Settlement’ in FASB Interpretation No. 48.” We adopted FIN No. 48 and FSP FIN 48-1 effective February 4, 2007. For additional
information, see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.

Revenue Recognition

While our recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment, revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy for our
organization. We recognize revenue upon customer receipt of the merchandise. For e-commerce and catalogue revenues, we estimate shipments that have not been received by the customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times. We also
provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience.

All of our brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers in
retail stores, through our direct channels and through third parties. We do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards. We recognize income from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer. In addition, we recognize income on
unredeemed gift cards when we can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions (gift card breakage). We determine the gift



card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. We accumulated sufficient historical data to determine the gift card breakage rate at
Bath & Body Works and Express during the fourth quarter of 2005 and Victoria’s Secret during the fourth quarter of 2007. Gift card breakage is included in Net Sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recognized $30 million in pretax income related to the initial recognition of gift card breakage at Express and Bath &
Body Works. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we recognized $48 million in pretax income related to the initial recognition of gift card breakage at Victoria’s Secret.

Additionally, we recognize revenue associated with merchandise sourcing services provided to third parties, consisting primarily of former subsidiaries as well as other third parties. Revenue is recognized at the time
the title passes to the customer.

Other Items

2008 Segment Cost Allocation Change

In 2007, we reviewed our corporate organization and allocation methodology as a result of
changes in our business including the divestitures of Express and Limited Stores. Consistent with these business changes, we have transferred certain individuals and functions from corporate to our operating business units. Further, commencing in
2008, we are changing our methodology for allocating certain remaining corporate costs to our operating business units, including, but not limited to, costs related to store real estate and store design and construction activities. This change will
primarily impact General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses across our segments.

The following table provides a reconciliation of operating
income (loss) amounts if these changes had been adopted for 2007, 2006 and 2005:



ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Market Risk

The market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency
exchange rates or interest rates.

Our foreign exchange rate exposure is primarily the result of the January 2007 acquisition of La Senza Corporation,
whose operations are conducted primarily in Canada. To mitigate the risk to our earnings and the fair value of our investment in La Senza associated with fluctuations in the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange rate, we entered into a series of
cross-currency swaps related to Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans. These cross-currency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate Canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate U.S. dollar interest payments as well as exchange
of Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar principal payments upon maturity. The swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same time as the related loans. As a result of the Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans and the related
cross-currency swaps, we do not believe there is any material risk associated with fluctuations in the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange rate.

We are
exposed to interest rate risk in relation to our investments and our debt. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities. Our
investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer. The primary
objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. Given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not
believe there is any material risk associated with increases or decreases in interest rates.

The majority of our long-term debt as of February 2,
2008 has fixed interest rates. Thus, our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows. Our $750 million term loan due August 2012 contains a
variable interest rate that fluctuates based on changes in an underlying benchmark interest rate and changes in our credit rating. In January 2008, we executed a participating interest rate swap arrangement which limits our exposure to increases in
the benchmark interest rate while allowing us to partially participate in any decreases in the benchmark interest rate. Prior to the execution of the participating interest rate swap, a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in the average term loan
interest rate would have resulted in $3 million of additional interest expense during 2007.

We use derivative financial instruments like the
cross-currency swaps and the participating interest rate swap arrangement to manage exposure to market risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

As of February 2, 2008, management believes that the carrying values of
cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. The estimated fair value of our long-term debt was $2.8 billion compared to the carrying value of $2.9 billion
at February 2, 2008. The estimated fair value of our long-term debt was $1.6 billion compared to the carrying value of $1.7 billion at February 3, 2007. The aggregate fair value of our foreign currency swap arrangements was a liability of
$54 million as of February 2, 2008 and a liability of $3 million as of February 3, 2007. The fair value of our participating interest rate swap arrangement was a liability of $13 million as of February 2, 2008.

Concentration of Credit Risk

We maintain cash and cash equivalents
with various major financial institutions, as well as corporate commercial paper. We monitor the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and other entities and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. We also monitor
the creditworthiness of the entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the
Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2008. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).

Based on our assessment
and the COSO criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2008.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young LLP’s report appears
on the following page and expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2008.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

To the Board of Directors
and Shareholders of

Limited Brands, Inc.:

We have audited
Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Limited Brands, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of February 2, 2008, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Shareholders’ Equity,
and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 2, 2008 of Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries, and our report dated March 28, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial Statements

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of

Limited Brands, Inc.:

We have audited the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Shareholders’ Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the
three years in the period ended February 2, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Limited
Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries at February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 2, 2008, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2007 the Company adopted Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”; in 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised), “Share-Based Payment” and in
2005, the Company changed its method of accounting for inventories.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 28, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Limited Brands, Inc. (the Company) operates in the highly competitive specialty retail business. The Company is a
specialty retailer of women’s intimate apparel, apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories under various trade names. The Company sells its merchandise through specialty retail stores in the United States and Canada, which are
primarily mall-based, and through e-commerce and catalogue direct response channels. The Company currently operates the following retail brands:

Victoria’s Secret

•

Pink (Victoria’s Secret)

•

La Senza

•

Bath & Body Works

•

C. O. Bigelow

•

The White Barn Candle Company

•

Henri Bendel

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of Express and Limited Stores through their divestiture dates which were July 6, 2007 and August 3, 2007, respectively.

Subsequent to the divestitures of Express and Limited Stores, the Company’s remaining 25% ownership interest in each is accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. As a result, the Company’s share of net income or loss for both Express and Limited Stores is included in Other Income (Loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company eliminates in consolidation 25% of sales to Express
and Limited Stores consistent with the Company’s ownership percentage.

The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements also include less than
100% owned variable interest entities in which the Company is designated as the primary beneficiary in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.”

The Company accounts for investments in unconsolidated entities where it exercises significant influence, but does not have control, using the equity
method. The Company’s share of net income or loss of unconsolidated entities from which the Company purchases merchandise or merchandise components is included in Cost of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy on the Consolidated Statements of
Income. The Company’s share of net income or loss of all other unconsolidated entities is included in Other Income (Loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company’s equity investments are required to be tested for impairment
when it is determined there may be an other than temporary loss in value.

Fiscal Year

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. As used herein, “2007” and “2005” refer to the 52 week periods ending February 2, 2008 and January 28, 2006,
respectively. “2006” refers to the 53 week period ended February 3, 2007.



Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and Cash Equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions and highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than 90 days. The Company’s outstanding checks amounted to $121 million as of
February 2, 2008 and $110 million as of February 3, 2007 and are included in Accounts Payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions, as well as
corporate commercial paper. The Company monitors the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and other entities and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. The Company also monitors the creditworthiness of the
entities to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

Inventories

Inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or market, on a weighted-average cost basis.

The Company records valuation adjustments to its inventories if the cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount it expects to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These
estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience.

The Company also
records inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory. These estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends.

Store Supplies

The initial shipment of
selling-related supplies (primarily hangers, signage and security tags) is capitalized on the store opening date. Subsequent shipments are expensed. Store supplies are adjusted as appropriate for changes in actual quantities or costs. The
Company’s store supplies are included in Other Current Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Direct Response Advertising

The Company capitalizes the direct costs of producing and distributing its catalogues and amortizes the costs over the expected future revenue stream, which is generally
three months from the date the catalogues are mailed.

The Company’s capitalized direct response advertising costs amounted to $33 million as of
February 2, 2008 and $34 million as of February 3, 2007 and are included in Other Current Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All other advertising costs are expensed at the time the promotion first appears in media or in the store.
Catalogue and advertising costs amounted to $519 million for 2007, $603 million for 2006 and $517 million for 2005.



Property and Equipment

The Company’s property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciation and amortization is computed on a straight-line basis using the following depreciable life ranges:

When a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated
useful life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life. The Company’s cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with
any resulting gain or loss included in net income. The Company’s maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and betterments that extend useful lives are capitalized.

Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If
the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, usually determined by the estimated discounted
future cash flows of the asset. Factors used in the valuation include, but are not limited to, management’s plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results and projected future cash flows.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company has certain intangible
assets resulting from business combinations that are recorded at cost. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives ranging from 4 to 20 years. These amortizable
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying
value, the Company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for
impairment at least annually by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value.

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the
fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not subject to periodic amortization. The Company reviews its goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. The impairment review is
performed by comparing each reporting unit’s carrying value to its estimated fair value.

Factors used in the valuation of intangible assets and
goodwill include, but are not limited to, management’s plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results and projected cash flows.

Leases and Leasehold Improvements

The Company has leases that contain predetermined fixed escalations of minimum rentals and/or rent
abatements subsequent to taking possession of the leased property. The Company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight-line basis commencing upon store possession date. The Company records the difference between the recognized rental
expense and amounts payable under the leases as deferred lease credits. The Company’s liability for predetermined fixed escalations of minimum rentals and/or rent abatements amounted to $77 million



as of February 2, 2008 and $98 million as of February 3, 2007. These liabilities are included in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

The Company receives allowances from landlords related to its retail stores. These allowances are generally comprised of cash amounts
received by the Company from its landlords as part of the negotiated lease terms. The Company records a receivable and a landlord allowance at the lease commencement date (date of initial possession of the store). The deferred lease credit is
amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease (including the pre-opening build-out period) and the receivable is reduced as amounts are received from the landlord. The Company’s unamortized portion
of landlord allowances amounted to $185 million as of both February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007 and is included in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company also has leasehold improvements which are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the period from the date the assets are placed in
service to the end of the initial lease term. Leasehold improvements made after the inception of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term, including renewal periods, if
reasonably assured.

Foreign Currency Translation

The
functional currency of the Company’s foreign operations is generally the applicable local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, while revenues
and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. The Company’s resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) within the Consolidated Statements of
Shareholders’ Equity.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments are
accounted for in accordance with SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”) as amended, which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at
fair value.

The Company’s foreign exchange rate exposure is primarily the result of the January 2007 acquisition of La Senza Corporation whose
operations are conducted primarily in Canada. To mitigate the exposure to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange rate, the Company entered into a series of cross-currency swaps related to Canadian dollar denominated intercompany
loans. These cross-currency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate Canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate U.S. dollar interest payments as well as exchange of Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar principal payments upon maturity. The
swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same time as the related loans.

The cross-currency interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow
hedges of foreign currency exchange risk. Changes in the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange rate result in reclassification of amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings to offset foreign currency transaction gains and
losses recognized on the intercompany loans. The Company’s aggregate fair value of foreign currency swap arrangements was a liability of $54 million as of February 2, 2008 and a liability of $3 million as of February 3, 2007. These
liabilities are included in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In March and June 2007, the Company entered into interest rate
lock agreements designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the anticipated future issuance of debt. In conjunction with the Company’s issuance of notes during July 2007, the interest rate locks were
settled. Based on changes between the anticipated and actual amount and timing of the debt issuance, the Company concluded during the second



quarter of 2007 that the interest rate locks no longer qualified as cash flow hedges. As a result, $17 million of realized pretax gains from the settlement
of the interest rate locks was recognized in earnings in the second quarter of 2007. The gain on the interest rate lock agreements is included in Other Income (Loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

In January 2008, the Company entered into a participating interest rate swap arrangement designated as a cash flow hedge to mitigate exposure to interest rate
fluctuations related to the Company’s $750 million Term Loan. The fair value of the participating interest rate swap arrangement was a liability of $13 million as of February 2, 2008 which is included in Other Long-term Liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Income Taxes

The Company
accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, the amount of taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
income tax rates is recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than
not that such assets will not be realized.

In determining the Company’s provision for income taxes, it uses an annual effective income tax rate based
on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates. The Company adjusts the annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available. The Company’s
effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.

The Company’s income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding the Company’s tax filing positions,
including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. The Company records an accrual for more likely than
not exposures after evaluating the positions associated with its various income tax filings. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which the Company has established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified. The
Company adjusts its tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from its established accrual, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant
taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. The Company includes its tax contingencies accrual, including accrued penalties and interest, in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
unless the liability is expected to be paid within one year. Changes to the tax contingencies accrual, including accrued penalties and interest, are included in Provision for Income Taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”, an Interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109. In May 2007, the FASB issued FSP FIN 48-1, “Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48”. The Company adopted FIN No. 48 and FSP FIN 48-1 effective February 4, 2007. For additional
information, see Note 2, “New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Principle” and Note 10, “Income Taxes.”



Self Insurance

The
Company is self-insured for medical, workers’ compensation, general liability and automobile benefits up to certain stop-loss limits. Such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred but not reported (“IBNR”)
claims. IBNR claims are estimated using historical claim information and actuarial estimates.

Minority Interest

Minority interest represents the portion of equity interests of consolidated affiliates not owned by the Company.

Share-based Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based
employee compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”). SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees and directors to be recognized in the financial
statements as compensation cost over the service period based on their fair value on the date of grant.

Compensation cost is recognized over the service
period on a straight-line basis for the fair value of awards that actually vest. Compensation expense for stock options is recognized, net of forfeitures, using a single option approach (each option is valued as one grant, irrespective of the number
of vesting tranches). Compensation cost for restricted stock is recognized, net of forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

The Company has a policy of issuing treasury shares to satisfy award exercises or conversions.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes sales upon customer receipt of the merchandise, which for e-commerce and catalogue revenues reflects an estimate of shipments that have not yet
been received by the customer based on shipping terms and estimated delivery times. The Company’s shipping and handling revenues are included in Net Sales with the related costs included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy on the
Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company also provides a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience. Net Sales exclude sales tax collected from customers.

The Company’s brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers. The Company does not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards. The Company recognizes income from gift cards when they are
redeemed by the customer. In addition, the Company recognizes income on unredeemed gift cards when it can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and that there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift
cards to relevant jurisdictions (gift card breakage). The Company determines the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. The Company accumulated enough historical data to determine the gift card breakage rate at
Bath & Body Works and Express during the fourth quarter of 2005 and Victoria’s Secret during the fourth quarter of 2007. Gift card breakage is included in Net Sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recognized $30 million in pretax income related to the initial recognition of gift card breakage at Express and
Bath & Body Works. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recognized $48 million in pretax income related to the initial recognition of gift card breakage at Victoria’s Secret.

Additionally, the Company recognizes revenue associated with merchandise sourcing services provided to third parties, consisting of former subsidiaries as well as other
third parties. Revenue is recognized at the time the title passes to the customer.



Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy

The Company’s costs of goods sold include merchandise costs, net of discounts and allowances, freight and inventory shrinkage. The Company’s buying and occupancy expenses primarily include payroll, benefit
costs and operating expenses for its buying departments and distribution network, rent, common area maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance, catalogue amortization and depreciation for the Company’s stores, warehouse facilities
and equipment.

General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses

The Company’s general, administrative and store operating expenses primarily include payroll and benefit costs for its store-selling and administrative departments (including corporate functions), marketing,
advertising and other operating expenses not specifically categorized elsewhere in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Earnings Per Share

Earnings per basic share is computed based on the weighted-average number of outstanding common shares. Earnings per diluted share include the
weighted-average effect of dilutive options and restricted stock on the weighted-average shares outstanding.

The following table provides shares utilized
for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2007, 2006 and 2005:

Approximately 9 million stock options as of February 2, 2008 and 6 million stock options as of both
February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006 were outstanding, but were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. These options were excluded because the exercise prices were greater than or equal to the average price of the
common shares and, therefore, their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive Income (Loss) consists of gains and losses on derivative instruments and foreign currency translation adjustments. The cumulative gains and losses on these
items are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity.

The following table provides additional detail regarding the composition of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007:



Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates and the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.

2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Principle

New Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS 161 “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 161”)

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS 161, which requires disclosures about the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains or losses in tabular format as well as
disclosures regarding credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements, counterparty credit risk and strategies and objectives for using derivative instruments. SFAS 161 amends and expands SFAS 133 and is effective prospectively
beginning in 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the impact to its financial statements.

SFAS 141 (revised 2007) “Business
Combinations” (“SFAS 141(R)”)

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS 141(R), which
establishes how the acquiring entity recognizes and measures the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any gain on bargain purchases and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. SFAS 141R requires acquisition-related costs to be
expensed in the periods they are incurred, with the exception of the costs to issue debt or equity securities. SFAS 141R requires disclosure of information for a business combination that occurs during the accounting period or prior to the
issuance of the financial statements for the accounting period. SFAS 141R is effective prospectively for business combinations with an acquisition date on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period after December 15,
2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact to its financial statements.

SFAS 160 “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements” (“SFAS 160”)

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160, which modifies reporting for noncontrolling interest
(minority interest) in consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 requires noncontrolling interest be reported in equity and establishes a new framework for recognizing net income or loss and comprehensive income by the controlling
interest. SFAS 160 requires specific disclosures regarding changes in equity interest of both the controlling and noncontrolling parties and presentation of the noncontrolling equity balance and income or loss for all periods
presented. SFAS 160 is effective for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The statement is applied prospectively upon adoption. Upon adoption, prior period financial statements will be
restated for the presentation of the noncontrolling interest for comparability. The Company is currently evaluating the impact to its financial statements.

SFAS 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”)

In February 2007, the FASB
issued SFAS 159 permitting entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparison between entities
that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. If the fair value option is elected, the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value is reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening
balance of retained earnings. The statement is applied prospectively upon adoption. The Company does not plan to elect fair value treatment for any assets or liabilities under SFAS 159 as of the beginning of 2008.



SFAS 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”)

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, which provides guidance for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and instruments measured at fair value that are
classified in shareholders’ equity. The statement defines fair value, establishes a fair value measurement framework and expands fair value disclosures. It emphasizes that fair value is market-based with the highest measurement
hierarchy level being market prices in active markets. The standard requires fair value measurements be disclosed by hierarchy level, an entity include its own credit standing in the measurement of its liabilities and modifies the transaction
price presumption.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-2 “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157” which delays the effective
date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least
annually). The provision of SFAS 157 is applied prospectively. The Company plans to adopt the required portions of SFAS 157 at the beginning of 2008 and does not expect a material impact to the financial statements. The Company plans
to adopt SFAS 157 at the beginning of 2009 for items within the scope of FSP FAS 157-2 and is currently evaluating the impact of this portion to the financial statements.

Changes in Accounting Principle

Income Taxes

Effective February 4, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes” (“FIN 48”), an interpretation of FASB Statement 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Upon adoption, the Company recognized an additional $10 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as a
reduction to the Company’s opening balance of retained earnings on February 4, 2007. For additional information, see Note 10, “Income Taxes.”

Share-based Compensation

On January 29, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS
123(R)”), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company
accounted for share-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”). Under the
intrinsic value method, no stock-based compensation expense was recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income, other than for restricted stock, because the exercise price of the Company’s stock options granted to employees
and directors was equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant.

The Company adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified
prospective transition method, which requires the application of the accounting standard as of January 29, 2006, the first day of the Company’s fiscal year 2006. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS 123(R).

Share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income under SFAS 123(R) is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and, accordingly, has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS 123(R) requires
forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on the Consolidated Statement of Income for
the year ended February 3, 2007 of $0.7 million (net of tax of $0.4 million) relates to an estimate of forfeitures of previously recognized unvested restricted stock awards outstanding as of January 29, 2006, the date of adoption of SFAS
123(R).



The following table provides an illustration of the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share for the fiscal
year ended January 28, 2006 as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation prior to January 29, 2006:

Inventory Valuation

During 2005, the Company changed its inventory valuation method. Previously, inventories were principally valued at the lower of cost or market, on a weighted-average cost basis, using the retail method. Commencing in 2005, inventories are
principally valued at the lower of cost or market, on a weighted-average cost basis, using the cost method. The Company believes the cost method is preferable as compared to the retail method because it will increase the organizational focus on the
actual margin realized on each sale. Additionally, it is consistent with the practices of many other retailers as well as the Company’s personal care and beauty competitors.

The cumulative effect of this change was $17 million, net of tax of $11 million. This change was recognized as an increase to net income in the Consolidated Statements of Income as of the beginning of the first
quarter of 2005. In addition to the $17 million cumulative impact recognized as of the beginning of the first quarter, the effect of the change during 2005 was to decrease net income by $4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share.

3. Acquisitions and Divestitures

Acquisition

La Senza Corporation

On January 12, 2007,
the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the stock of La Senza Corporation (“La Senza”) for $600 million, including transaction costs of $8 million. The acquisition was financed through the use of existing cash and was accounted
for as a purchase, with results of operations included in the Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of acquisition. La Senza is a Canadian specialty retailer offering lingerie and sleepwear as well as apparel for girls in the 7-14 year
age group. In addition, independently owned La Senza stores operate in 40 other countries under license arrangements. The acquisition of La Senza supports the Company’s objective of enhancing our capabilities to pursue our strategic growth
goals internationally.



The following table provides estimated fair values, in millions, of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the
date of acquisition:

Divestitures

Express

On July 6, 2007, the Company completed the divestiture of 75% of its ownership interest in Express to affiliates of Golden
Gate Capital for pretax net cash proceeds of $547 million. For additional information, see Note 8, “Equity Investments.” The Company recorded a pretax gain on the divestiture of $302 million which reflected a $4 million lease guarantee
liability. For additional information, see Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies.”

In conjunction with the transaction, the Company and
Express entered into transition services agreements whereby the Company will provide support to Express in various operational areas including logistics, technology and merchandise sourcing. The terms of these transition services arrangements varies
and ranges from 3 months to 3 years. The Company recognized $353 million of merchandise sourcing revenue from Express during 2007 subsequent to the divestiture date. The Company has eliminated 25% of the merchandise sourcing revenue consistent with
its ownership percentage. The Company’s accounts receivable from Express totaled $151 million as of February 2, 2008 for merchandise sourcing and other services provided in accordance with the terms and conditions of their transition
services agreements.

Limited Stores

On August 3,
2007, the Company completed the divestiture of 75% of its ownership interest in Limited Stores to affiliates of Sun Capital. As part of the agreement, Sun Capital contributed $50 million of equity capital into the business and arranged a $75 million
credit facility. For additional information, see Note 8, “Equity Investments.” The Company recorded a pretax loss on the divestiture of $72 million which reflected an $8 million lease guarantee liability. For additional information, see
Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies.”

In conjunction with the transaction, the Company and Limited Stores entered into transition services
agreements where the Company will provide support to Limited Stores in various operational areas including logistics, technology and merchandise sourcing. The terms of these transition services arrangements varies and ranges from 3 months to 3
years. The Company recognized $75 million of merchandise sourcing revenue from Limited Stores during 2007 subsequent to the divestiture date. The Company has eliminated 25% of the merchandise sourcing revenue consistent with its ownership
percentage. The Company’s accounts receivable from Limited Stores totaled $22 million as of February 2, 2008 for merchandise sourcing and other services provided in accordance with the terms and conditions of their transition services
agreements.

4. Restructuring Activities

During the
second quarter of 2007, the Company initiated a restructuring program designed to resize the Company’s corporate infrastructure and to adjust for the impact of the Apparel divestitures. This program



resulted in the elimination of approximately 500 positions (or 10%) of the Company’s corporate and home office headcount through position eliminations
and transfers to Express and Limited Stores. The Company recognized pretax charges consisting primarily of severance and related costs of $34 million for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008. These costs are included in General,
Administrative and Store Operating Expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

The following table summarizes these restructuring activities for the
fiscal year ended February 2, 2008:

During 2007, the Company recognized charges totaling $20 million related to the disposition of a personal care
business which includes the goodwill impairment discussed in Note 7, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, costs to wind down the operations of the business and a charge to repurchase the minority interest from the Company’s
investment partner. Additionally, the Company recognized $2 million of costs consisting primarily of property and equipment write-offs associated with the closure of the six Diva London concept stores. The Company also recognized and recorded gains
related to the sale of two corporate aircraft for $25 million. The Company recorded these costs and gains in General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

5. Inventories

The following table provides inventories as of
February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007:

6. Property and Equipment, Net

Property and Equipment, Net as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007 were as follows:



7. Goodwill, Trade Names and Other Intangible Assets, Net

The following table provides the rollforward of goodwill for the fiscal years ended February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007:

In conjunction with the January 2007 acquisition of La Senza, the Company recorded $313 million in goodwill, which
is not deductible for tax purposes, $170 million in intangible assets with indefinite lives and $26 million in intangible assets with finite lives. The intangible assets with finite lives consist primarily of international licensing arrangements and
favorable store operating lease agreements. These intangible assets have an estimated weighted-average amortization period of 13 years. The intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of trade names.

An additional $9 million of goodwill was recorded as a result of the Company’s acquisition of a personal care business in 2006.

In February 2007, the Company acquired a personal care products business along with an investment partner. Net assets of the acquired business consisted primarily of
goodwill. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company and its investment partner made a decision to close the operations of the acquired business. Based on this decision, the Company completed a valuation of the acquired business trade name,
which the Company intends to continue to use. Based on the Company’s evaluation, $12 million of the $25 million purchase price was allocated to the trade name. The remaining $13 million was recognized as an impairment charge in operating income
in the second quarter of 2007 within the Other segment. The Company recognized the investment partner’s portion of the impairment charge of $7 million in minority interest on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Intangible assets with indefinite lives represent the Victoria’s Secret, Bath & Body Works and La Senza trade names. These assets totaled $611 million as
of February 2, 2008 and $579 million as of February 3, 2007 and are included in Trade Names and Other Intangible Assets, Net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following table provides intangible assets with finite lives as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007:



Amortization expense was $14 million for 2007, $11 million for 2006 and $11 million for 2005. Estimated future annual
amortization expense will be approximately $9 million in each of 2008, 2009 and 2010, $7 million in 2011, $5 million in 2012 and $27 million thereafter.

8. Equity Investments

Express

On
July 6, 2007, the Company completed the divestiture of 75% of its ownership interest in Express to affiliates of Golden Gate Capital. The Company’s remaining 25% investment in Express is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Accordingly, the Company recorded 25% of Express’ results for the period from July 7, 2007 through February 2, 2008 in Other Income (Loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company’s investment carrying value for
Express was $99 million as of February 2, 2008 and is included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Limited Stores

On August 3, 2007, the Company completed the divestiture of 75% of its ownership interest in Limited Stores to affiliates of Sun Capital. The Company’s
remaining 25% investment in Limited Stores is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, the Company recorded 25% of Limited Stores’ results for the period from August 4, 2007 through February 2, 2008 in Other
Income (Loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company’s investment carrying value for Limited Stores was $13 million as of February 2, 2008 and is included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Easton

The Company has land and other investments in Easton, a 1,300
acre planned community in Columbus, Ohio that integrates office, hotel, retail, residential and recreational space. These investments, at cost, totaled $62 million as of February 2, 2008 and $59 million as of February 3, 2007 and are
recorded in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Included in the Company’s Easton investments is an equity interest in Easton Town
Center, LLC (“ETC”), an entity that owns and has developed a commercial entertainment and shopping center. The Company’s investment in ETC is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Company has a majority financial
interest in ETC, but another unaffiliated member manages ETC. Certain significant decisions regarding ETC require the consent of unaffiliated members in addition to the Company.

In July 2007, ETC refinanced its $290 million secured bank loan replacing it with a $405 million secured bank loan. The loan is payable in full on August 9, 2017.

In conjunction with the loan refinancing, ETC repaid the existing loan, reserved cash for capital expenditures and operations and authorized the distribution of $150
million to ETC members. As an ETC member, the Company received approximately $102 million of proceeds resulting in a $100 million gain after reducing the Company’s ETC carrying value from $2 million to zero. The gain is included in Other Income
(Loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company’s carrying value in its investment in ETC was $4 million as of February 3, 2007.

Total assets of ETC were approximately $262 million as of February 2, 2008 and $240 million as of February 3, 2007.



9. Accrued Expenses and Other

The following table provides accrued expenses and other as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007:

10. Income Taxes

The following table provides the components of the Company’s provision for income taxes for 2007, 2006 and 2005:

The foreign component of pretax income, arising principally from overseas operations, was $40 million for 2007,
$54 million for 2006 and $56 million for 2005. The non-U.S. tax provision reflects the impact of enacted statutory rate decreases in Canada. In January 2006, the Company approved a qualifying reinvestment plan and repatriated $395 million of untaxed
foreign earnings pursuant to the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. This repatriation resulted in a one-time tax benefit of $77 million in the fourth quarter of 2005.



The following table provides the reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax rate and the effective tax rate
for 2007, 2006 and 2005:

The Company’s effective tax rate has historically reflected and continues to reflect a provision related to
the undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates. The Company has recorded a deferred tax liability for those amounts, but the taxes are not paid until the earnings are deemed repatriated to the United States.

Deferred Taxes

The following table provides the effect of temporary
differences that cause deferred income taxes as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007:

In connection with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”), the Company reclassified $114 million included in the “Other, Net” balance at February 3, 2007 which included a $107 million reclassification from Current
Liabilities - Income Taxes to Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

As of February 2, 2008, the Company had available for
state income tax purposes net operating loss carryforwards which expire, if unused, in the years 2008 through 2026. The Company has analyzed the realization of the state net operating loss carryforwards on an individual state basis. In 2006, the
Company had a valuation allowance against substantially all of these net operating losses. In the second quarter of 2007, a substantial portion of the valuation allowance was reversed in connection with the Apparel divestitures. In 2007, for those
states where the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that the state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance has been provided for the deferred tax asset.



As of February 2, 2008, the Company had available for non-U.S. tax purposes a net operating loss carryforward which
expires, if unused, in 2028. The Company has determined that it is more likely than not that substantially all of the net operating loss carryforward will not be realized and a valuation allowance has been provided for the net deferred tax assets,
including the net operating loss carryforward, of the related tax loss entity.

Income taxes payable on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets
included net current deferred tax liabilities of $4 million as of February 2, 2008 and $40 million as of February 3, 2007. The Company also had net current deferred tax assets of $75 million as of February 2, 2008 which are included
in Other Current Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Income tax payments were $428 million for 2007, $451 million for 2006 and $298 million for 2005.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Effective February 4, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation
No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”), an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” FIN 48 requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a
tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured
at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Upon adoption, the Company recognized an additional $10 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for
as a reduction to the Company’s opening balance of retained earnings on February 4, 2007. Including this adjustment, the Company had $131 million of unrecognized tax benefits at February 4, 2007, $85 million of which, if recognized,
would affect the effective income tax rate and $6 million of which, if recognized, would impact Goodwill. Additionally, the Company reclassified $107 million of unrecognized tax benefits from Current Liabilities - Income Taxes to Other Long-term
Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

At February 2, 2008, the Company had $144 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $97 million of which,
if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, it is reasonably possible that $18 million could change in the next twelve months due to audit settlements, expiration of statute of limitations or
other resolution of uncertainties. Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be different from this estimate. In such case, the
Company will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the tax provision or reclassify amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the period in which such the matter is effectively settled with the tax authority.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as components of income tax expense. For 2007, $4 million of interest and penalties
was included in the Provision for Income Tax. The Company had accrued approximately $39 million and $40 million for the payment of interest and penalties as of February 4, 2007 and February 2, 2008, respectively.

The following table summarizes the activity related to its unrecognized tax benefits for U.S. federal, state & non-U.S. tax jurisdictions for 2007 without
interest and penalties:



The Company files U.S. federal income tax returns as well as income tax returns in various states and in non-U.S.
jurisdictions. At the beginning of 2007, the Company was subject to examination by the IRS for calendar years 2003 through 2007. Subsequently, the audits for the 2003, 2004 and 2005 tax years have been completed. The Company is also subject to
various U.S. state and local income tax examinations for the years 1999 to 2007. Finally, the Company is subject to multiple non-U.S. tax jurisdictions for the years 2000 to 2007. In some situations, the Company determines that it does not have a
filing requirement in a particular tax jurisdiction. Where no return has been filed, no statute of limitations applies. Accordingly, if a tax jurisdiction reaches a conclusion that a filing requirement does exist, additional years may be reviewed by
the tax authority. The Company believes it has appropriately accounted for uncertainties related to this issue.

The timing of when earnings are
repatriated was a matter of dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). The Company successfully litigated the matter related to the 1992 to 1994 years. For the 1995 to 2002 years, the Company and the IRS negotiated a settlement
that determined that a portion of the foreign earnings had been repatriated. This settlement was approved in December 2005 resulting in a tax refund of $63 million which was recorded as an increase to Deferred Tax Liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. The Company’s interest refund of $40 million was recorded in Interest Income and Accounts Receivable in 2005 and was collected in 2006.

11. Long-term Debt

The following table provides the Company’s long-term debt balance as of February 2, 2008 and February 3,
2007:

In July 2007, the Company issued $700 million of 6.90% notes due July 15, 2017 and $300 million of 7.60%
notes due July 15, 2037 utilizing a shelf registration statement under which up to $1 billion of debt securities, common and preferred stock and other securities could be issued. Interest on the notes is payable on January 15 and
July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2008.

On August 3, 2007, the Company amended the October 2004 $500 million Term Loan
agreement to increase the borrowing capacity to $750 million and extend the term to August 2012. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company borrowed the additional $250 million under the Term Loan agreement.

On August 3, 2007, the Company amended its $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “5-Year Facility”) by extending its term to August 2012 and
executed a $500 million, 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility (the “364-Day Facility”). Both facilities support the Company’s commercial paper and letter of credit programs. As of February 2, 2008, there were no borrowings
outstanding under either facility. Fees payable



under the 5-Year Facility are based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings and are currently 0.125% of the committed amount per year. Fees payable
under the 364-Day Facility are also based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings and are currently 0.10% of the committed amount per year.

In
January 2006, Mast Industries (Far East) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Limited Brands, Inc., entered into a $60 million unsecured revolving credit facility. During 2006, $30 million was drawn on the facility while the remaining $30 million
expired in March 2006. The credit facility was available for general corporate purposes including the funding of dividends to Limited Brands, Inc. Borrowings under the credit facility are due in equal semi-annual installments through the maturity
date of the credit facility in January 2010.

The Facilities and the Term Loan have several interest rate options, which are based in part on the
Company’s long-term credit ratings. These agreements also require the Company to maintain certain specified fixed charge and debt-to-earnings ratios and prohibit certain types of liens on property or assets. The Company was in compliance
with the covenant requirements as of February 2, 2008.

In January 2008, the Company entered into a participating interest rate swap arrangement
designated as a cash flow hedge to mitigate exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to the Term Loan.

The following table provides principal
payments due on long-term debt in the next five fiscal years and the remaining years thereafter:

Cash paid for interest was $151 million in 2007, $100 million in 2006 and $96 million in 2005.

12. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) SFAS 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments” (“SFAS 107”), requires management to disclose the estimated fair value of certain assets and liabilities defined by SFAS
107 as financial instruments. As of February 2, 2008, management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of their short maturity.

Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement, if available. In the absence of
quoted prices for identical or similar assets or investments in active markets, fair value is estimated using various valuation methods including cash flow analysis and appraisals.

The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt was $2.8 billion compared to the carrying value of $2.9 billion at February 2, 2008. The estimated fair value of its long-term debt was $1.6 billion
compared to the carrying value of $1.7 billion at February 3, 2007. The aggregate fair value of the Company’s foreign currency swap arrangements was a liability of $54 million as of February 2, 2008 and a liability of $3 million as of
February 3, 2007. The fair value of the Company’s participating interest rate swap arrangement was a liability of $13 million as of February 2, 2008.



13. Leases

The
Company is committed to noncancelable leases with remaining terms generally from one to ten years. A substantial portion of the Company’s leases consist of store leases generally with an initial term of ten years. Store lease terms generally
require additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses. Annual store rent consists of a fixed minimum amount and/or contingent rent based on a percentage of sales exceeding a stipulated amount.

The following table provides rent expense for 2007, 2006 and 2005:

The following table provides the Company’s minimum rent commitments under noncancelable operating leases in
the next five fiscal years and the remaining years thereafter:

(a)

Excludes additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses generally required by store lease terms.

The Company’s future sublease income under noncancelable subleases was $8 million as of February 2, 2008, which included $5 million of rent commitments related
to disposed businesses under master lease arrangements.

14. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of
business. Management believes that the ultimate liability arising from such claims and contingencies, if any, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company received $8.5 million from a favorable litigation settlement with respect to merchant fees previously paid to Visa and
MasterCard. The settlement was recognized in 2005 as a reduction to General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income.



Guarantees

In
connection with the divestitures of Express and Limited Stores, the Company recognized an initial liability of $12 million representing the estimated fair value of the Company’s obligation as guarantor of certain lease payments in accordance
with the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement 13, and Technical Corrections.” This liability was valued at $10 million as of
February 2, 2008.

In connection with the disposition of certain businesses, the Company has remaining guarantees of approximately $274 million
related to lease payments of Express, Limited Stores, Abercrombie & Fitch, Tween Brands (formerly Limited Too and Too, Inc.), Dick’s Sporting Goods (formerly Galyan’s), Lane Bryant, New York & Company and Anne.x under the
current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through 2017. These guarantees include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the
disposition of the businesses. In certain instances, the Company’s guarantee may remain in effect if the term of a lease is extended. The Company believes the likelihood of material liabilities being triggered under these guarantees, with
respect to existing and extended leases, is remote.

15. Retirement Benefits

The Company sponsors a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan and a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan. Participation in the tax-qualified plan is available to associates who meet certain age and
service requirements. Participation in the non-qualified plan is made available to associates who meet certain age, service, job level and compensation requirements.

The qualified plan permits associates to elect contributions up to the maximum limits allowable under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches associate contributions according to a predetermined formula and
contributes additional amounts based on a percentage of the associates’ eligible annual compensation and based on years of service. Associate contributions and Company matching contributions vest immediately. Additional Company
contributions and the related investment earnings are subject to vesting based on years of service. Total expense recognized related to the qualified plan was $44 million for 2007, $49 million for 2006 and $44 million for 2005.

The non-qualified plan is an unfunded plan which provides benefits beyond the Internal Revenue Code limits for qualified defined contribution plans. The plan permits
associates to elect contributions up to a maximum percentage of eligible compensation. The Company matches associate contributions according to a predetermined formula and credits additional amounts based on a percentage of the associates’
eligible compensation and years of service. The plan also permits associates to defer additional compensation up to a maximum amount. The Company does not match the contributions for additional deferred compensation. Associates’ accounts
are credited with interest using a rate determined annually based on an evaluation of the 10-year and 30-year borrowing rates available to the Company. Associate contributions and the related interest vest immediately. Company contributions, credits
and the related interest are subject to vesting based on years of service. Associates may elect an in-service distribution for the additional deferred compensation component only. Associates are not permitted to take a withdrawal from any other
portion of the plan while actively employed with the Company. The remaining vested portion of associates’ accounts in the plan will be distributed upon termination of employment in either a lump sum or in equal annual installments over a
specified period of up to 10 years.



The following table provides the Company’s annual activity for this plan and year-end liability, included in Other
Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007:

(a)

Reflects transfers to the plans established by Express and Limited Stores.

Total expense recognized related to the non-qualified plan was $22 million for 2007, $26 million for 2006 and $20 million for 2005.

16.
Shareholders’ Equity

Under the authority of the Company’s Board of Directors, the Company repurchased shares of its common stock under the
following repurchase programs during the fiscal years ended February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006:

(a)

The repurchase program authorized in November 2007 had $150 million remaining as of February 2, 2008.

(b)

The repurchase program authorized in June 2006 had repurchases of $59 million in 2007 at an average stock price of $25.86 and repurchases of $41 million in 2006 at an average stock
price of $27.11. This repurchase program was completed in May 2007.

(c)

The repurchase program authorized in November 2005 had repurchases of $42 million in 2006 at an average stock price of $23.40 and repurchases of $158 million in 2005 at an average
stock price of $22.67. This repurchase program was completed in February 2006.

For the November 2007 repurchase program, $8 million of share
repurchases were reflected in accounts payable as of February 2, 2008 and were settled in February 2008. Through March 21, 2008, 5.2 million additional shares were repurchased.



17. Share-Based Compensation

Plan Summary

The 1993 Stock Option and Performance Incentive Plan as amended (the “Plan”), which is shareholder approved,
provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance-based restricted stock, performance units and unrestricted shares. The Company grants stock options at a price
equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. Stock options have a maximum term of ten years. Stock options generally vest over 4 years with 25% vesting each year. Restricted stock generally vests (the restrictions lapse) over a
two to three year period.

The Limited Brands, Inc. Stock Award and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Associate Directors provides for an annual stock
retainer for non-associate directors. The stock issued in conjunction with this plan has no restrictions.

Under the Company’s plans, approximately
100 million options, restricted and unrestricted shares have been authorized to be granted to employees and directors. Approximately 21 million options and shares were available for grant as of February 2, 2008.

Stock Options

The following table provides the Company’s stock
option activity for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2008:

(a)

The number of options expected to vest includes an estimate of expected forfeitures.

Intrinsic value for stock options is the difference between the current market value of the Company’s stock and the option strike price. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $80 million for 2007,
$130 million for 2006 and $43 million for 2005.

The total fair value at grant date of option awards vested was $23
million for 2007 and $39 million for 2006.

The Company’s total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested
options was $14 million as of February 2, 2008. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.

The
weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted was $6.97 per share for 2007, $7.61 per share for 2006 and $7.54 (for pro forma purposes) for 2005.

Cash received from stock options exercised was $74 million for 2007, $153 million for 2006 and $64 million for 2005. Tax benefits realized from tax deductions associated with stock options exercised were $30 million for 2007, $50 million
for 2006 and $15 million for 2005.



The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (“Black-Scholes model”) for valuation of options
granted to employees and directors. The Company’s determination of the fair value of options is affected by the Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables
include, but are not limited to, the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.

The following table contains the weighted-average assumptions used during 2007, 2006 and 2005:

The expected volatility assumption is based on the Company’s analysis of historical volatility. The risk-free
interest rate assumption is based upon the average daily closing rates during the period for U.S. treasury notes that have a life which approximates the expected life of the option. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s
history and expectation of dividend payouts. The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding.

Restricted Stock

The following table provides the Company’s restricted stock activity for the fiscal year ended
February 2, 2008:

The Company’s total intrinsic value of restricted stock vested was $11 million for 2007, $14 million for 2006
and $11 million for 2005.

The Company’s total fair value at grant date of awards vested was $8 million for 2007 and $10 million for 2006. Fair value
of restricted stock awards is based on the market value of an unrestricted share on the grant date adjusted for anticipated dividend yields.

Beginning in
2006, the Company issued performance-based restricted stock awards. The fair value of these shares is measured on the date that the performance goals and the target number of shares are communicated. The final number of shares of performance-based
restricted stock issued to each employee is determined at the end of each Spring and Fall selling seasons, based upon performance against specified financial goals. The vesting period of these awards ranges from two to three years.

As of February 2, 2008, there was $19 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested restricted stock. That cost
is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.

Tax benefits realized from tax deductions associated with restricted stock
vested were $5 million for 2007, $4 million for 2006 and $4 million for 2005.



Income Statement Impact

Total pretax share-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS 123(R) was $44 million for 2007 and $37 million for 2006. Share-based compensation expense of $11 million for 2005 related primarily to restricted stock which the Company
also expensed under APB 25. The tax benefit associated with share-based compensation was $14 million for 2007, $11 million for 2006 and $4 million for 2005.

The following table provides share-based compensation expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2007, 2006 and 2005:
