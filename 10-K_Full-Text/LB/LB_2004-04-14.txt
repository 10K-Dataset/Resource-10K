SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995:

The Company cautions that any forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Report”) or otherwise made by the Company or management of the Company involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on
various important factors, many of which may be beyond the Company’s control. Accordingly, the Company’s future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward-looking statements.
Words such as “estimate,” “project,” “plan,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “planned,” “potential,” and similar expressions may identify
forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the Company’s financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results for 2004 and beyond to differ
materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements included in this Report or otherwise made by the Company or management: changes in consumer spending patterns, consumer preferences and overall economic conditions; the
potential impact of national and international security concerns on the retail environment, including any possible military action, terrorist attacks or other hostilities; the impact of competition and pricing; changes in weather patterns; political
stability; postal rate increases and charges; paper and printing costs; risks associated with the seasonality of the retail industry; risks related to consumer acceptance of the Company’s products and the ability to develop new merchandise; the
ability to retain, hire and train key personnel; risks associated with the possible inability of the Company’s manufacturers to deliver products in a timely manner; risks associated with relying on foreign sources of production; and risks
associated with the possible lack of availability of suitable store locations on appropriate terms. See Exhibit 99.1 for a more complete discussion of these and other factors that might affect the Company’s performance and financial results.
The Company does not undertake to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.

PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

GENERAL.

Limited Brands, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (including its subsidiaries, the “Company”), sells women’s intimate apparel, personal care products and women’s and men’s apparel under various trade names through its specialty retail stores and direct
response (catalogue and e-commerce) businesses. Merchandise is targeted to appeal to customers in various market segments that have distinctive consumer characteristics.

DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS.

General

.

As of January 31, 2004, the Company conducted its business in three primary segments: (1) Victoria’s Secret, which derives its revenues from sales of women’s intimate and other apparel, personal care
products and accessories marketed under the Victoria’s Secret brand name and sold through its stores and direct response (catalogue and e-commerce) businesses; (2) Bath & Body Works, which derives its revenues from the sale of personal care
products and accessories and home fragrance products marketed under the Bath & Body Works and White Barn Candle Company brand names; and (3) the Apparel segment, which derives its revenues from the sale of women’s and men’s apparel
through Express and Limited Stores.


The following chart reflects the retail businesses and the number of stores in operation for each segment at January 31,
2004 and February 1, 2003.

RETAIL
BUSINESSES

The following table shows the changes
in the number of retail stores operated by the Company for the past five fiscal years:

(a)

Represents 18 Galyan’s Trading Co. stores at August 31, 1999 (the date of the third party purchase of a 60% majority interest in Galyan’s Trading Co.) and 335 Limited Too
stores at the August 23, 1999 spin-off.

(b)

Represents Lane Bryant stores at August 16, 2001, the date of sale to a third party.

(c)

Represents Lerner stores at November 27, 2002, the date of sale to a third party.

The Company also owns Mast Industries, Inc. (“Mast”), a contract manufacturer and apparel importer which purchases merchandise on
behalf of the Company and certain third parties. During fiscal year 2003, approximately 35% of the Company’s merchandise purchases were sourced through Mast. Mast had external sales of $445 million in 2003. Mast’s operating results are
included in the Other segment. For additional information, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s 2003 Annual Report, incorporated herein by reference.

During fiscal year 2003, the Company purchased merchandise from over 1,000 suppliers located throughout the world. In addition to purchases
through Mast, the Company purchases merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the domestic market, some of which is manufactured overseas. The Company purchased approximately 10% of its merchandise from a single supplier, the loss of which
would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to source its products.

Most of the merchandise and related materials for the Company’s stores is shipped to the Company’s distribution centers in the Columbus, Ohio area. In connection with the distribution of merchandise, the
Company uses a range of shipping terms that result in the transfer of title to the merchandise at either the point of origin or point of destination.


The Company’s policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventory on hand in its retail stores and distribution
centers so that it can offer customers an appropriate selection of current merchandise. The Company emphasizes rapid turnover and takes markdowns as required to keep merchandise fresh and current with fashion trends.

The Company’s operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling
seasons: spring (the first and second quarters) and fall (the third and fourth quarters). The fourth quarter, including the holiday season, accounted for approximately one-third of net sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001. Accordingly, cash requirements are
highest in the third quarter as the Company’s inventory builds in advance of the holiday season.

Merchandise sales are paid for with cash, by personal check, and with credit and debit cards issued by third parties.

The Company offers its customers a return policy stated as “No Sale is Ever Final.” The Company believes that certain of its competitors offer similar service
policies.

The Company and its products are subject to regulation by various
Federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities. Our apparel business is subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements. The existing apparel quota system is scheduled to be eliminated as of January
1, 2005, but other trade restrictions remain in place and new ones may be imposed. The Company is unable to predict the effect such changes may have on its business, financial condition, or results of operations.

The following is a brief description of each of the Company’s Brand businesses,
including their respective target markets.

VICTORIA’S SECRET

Additional information about the Company’s business, including its revenues and profits
for the last three years and selling square footage, is set forth under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” of the 2003 Annual Report and is incorporated herein by reference. For the financial results of the
Company’s reportable operating segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2003 Annual Report, incorporated herein by reference.


COMPETITION.

The sale of intimate and other apparel and personal care products through retail stores is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors, including individual
and chain fashion specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. Brand image, marketing, fashion design, price, service, fashion selection and quality are the principal competitive factors in retail store sales. The Company’s
direct response business competes with numerous national and regional catalogue and e-commerce merchandisers. Image presentation, fulfillment and the factors in retail store sales discussed above are the principal competitive factors in catalogue
and e-commerce sales.

The Company is unable to estimate the number of
competitors or its relative competitive position due to the large number of companies selling apparel and personal care products through retail stores, catalogues and e-commerce.

ASSOCIATE RELATIONS.

On January 31, 2004, the Company employed approximately 111,100 associates, 86,800 of whom were part-time. In addition, temporary associates are hired during peak
periods, such as the holiday season.

AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

The Company’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available, free of charge, on the Company’s website, www.LimitedBrands.com. These reports are available as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with
or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

The Company’s business is principally conducted from office, distribution and shipping facilities located in the Columbus, Ohio area. Additional facilities are located in New York City, New York; Kettering, Ohio;
Rio Rancho, New Mexico; Paramus, New Jersey and Hong Kong. The Company also operates small sourcing-related office facilities in various foreign locations.

The distribution and shipping facilities owned by the Company consist of seven buildings located in the Columbus, Ohio area. These buildings, including attached office
space, comprise approximately 6.1 million square feet.

Substantially all of
the retail stores operated by the Company are located in leased facilities, primarily in malls and shopping centers throughout the continental United States. A substantial portion of these lease commitments consist of store leases generally with an
initial term of ten years. The leases expire at various dates between 2004 and 2020.

Typically, when space is leased for a retail store in a shopping center, all improvements, including interior walls, floors, ceilings, fixtures and decorations are supplied by the tenant. The cost of improvements varies widely, depending on
the design, size and location of the store. In certain cases, the landlord of the property may provide a construction allowance to fund all or a portion of the cost of improvements serving as a lease incentive. Rental terms for new locations usually
include a fixed minimum rent plus a percentage of sales in excess of a specified amount. Certain operating costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, insurance and taxes are typically paid by tenants.


ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

The Company is a defendant in a variety of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business.

In May and June 1999, purported shareholders of the Company filed three derivative actions in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, naming as defendants the
members of the Company’s board of directors and the Company, as nominal defendant. The operative complaint generally alleged that the rescission of the Contingent Stock Redemption Agreement previously entered into by the Company with Leslie H.
Wexner and The Wexner Children’s Trust (the “Contingent Stock Redemption Agreement”) constituted a waste of corporate assets and a breach of the board members’ fiduciary duties, and that the issuer tender offer completed on June
3, 1999 was a “wasteful transaction in its own right.” On February 16, 2000, plaintiffs filed a first amended consolidated derivative complaint (the “amended complaint”), which made allegations similar to the first complaint but
added allegations apparently intended to show that certain directors were not disinterested in those decisions. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on April 14, 2000 and, on March 27, 2002, the Court granted the motion in part and
denied the motion in part. On May 10, 2002, the Company’s board of directors appointed a special litigation committee composed of directors Donald B. Shackelford and Raymond Zimmerman and granted that committee the authority to investigate the
claims asserted in the amended complaint and to determine the Company’s response to them. On October 31, 2002, the special litigation committee (“SLC”) filed a motion on behalf of the Company to dismiss the action on the basis that
pursuit of the claims was not in the best interests of the Company. On February 25, 2004, the parties agreed to a settlement of the litigation. Under the terms of the settlement, Mr. Wexner, his immediate family members and affiliated entities have
agreed not to tender any shares in the issuer tender offer commenced by the Company on February 27, 2004 and not to sell any shares of Limited Brands common stock for a period commencing February 25, 2004 and ending six months after completion of
the tender offer. In addition, Mr. Wexner agreed to contribute to the Company an amount equal to one half of plaintiffs’ counsel fees and expenses awarded by the Court, with Mr. Wexner to contribute more than one half to the extent necessary to
limit the Company’s contribution to $3,000,000. Such contribution may be effected through the forfeiture of stock options, the payment of cash or other consideration. The Company, Mr. Wexner and the other defendants have agreed not to object to
aggregate plaintiffs’ counsel fees and expenses of up to $10,000,000. The settlement is subject to several conditions, including approval by the Delaware Court of Chancery.

Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any litigation, in the opinion of management, the
Company’s legal proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

On February 26, 2003, PwC informed the Company that it would decline to stand
for reelection by the Audit Committee as the Company’s independent auditors and, therefore, would not be responding to the Company’s invitation to submit a proposal related to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2004.

Report of Independent Accountants relating to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and subsidiaries as of February 1, 2003 and for each of the two years in the period ended February 1, 2003:

To the Board of Directors & Shareholders of Limited
Brands, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Limited Brands, Inc, and its subsidiaries at February 1, 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the two years in the period ended February 1, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” which changed the method of accounting for discontinued operations.
