SAFE HARBOR
STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995:

The Company cautions that any forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Report”) or made by management of the
Company involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors, many of which may be beyond the Company’s control. Accordingly, the Company’s future performance and financial results may differ
materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward–looking statements. Words such as “estimate,” “project,” “plan,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,”
and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the Company’s financial performance and actual results and could cause actual
results for 2003 and beyond to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements included in this Report or otherwise made by management: changes in consumer spending patterns, consumer preferences and overall
economic conditions; the potential impact of national and international security concerns on the retail environment, including any possible military action, terrorist attacks or other hostilities; the impact of competition and pricing; changes in
weather patterns; political stability; postal rate increases and charges; paper and printing costs; risks associated with the seasonality of the retail industry; risks related to consumer acceptance of the Company’s products and the ability to
develop new merchandise; the ability to retain, hire and train key personnel; risks associated with the possible inability of the Company’s manufacturers to deliver products in a timely manner; risks associated with relying on foreign sources
of production including the impact in Asia and elsewhere of the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and availability of suitable store locations on appropriate terms.

The Company does not undertake to publicly update or revise its
forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL.

Limited Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation (including its subsidiaries, the “Company”), sells women’s and men’s apparel, women’s intimate apparel and personal care products
under various trade names through its specialty retail stores and direct response (catalog and e-commerce) businesses. Merchandise is targeted to appeal to customers in various market segments that have distinctive consumer characteristics.

DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS.

General

.

As of February 1, 2003, the Company conducted its business in three primary
segments: (1) Victoria’s Secret, which derives its revenues from sales of women’s intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories marketed under the Victoria’s Secret brand name and sold through its stores and
direct response (catalog and e-commerce) businesses; (2) Bath & Body Works, which derives its revenues from the sale of personal care products and accessories and home fragrance products marketed under the Bath & Body Works and White Barn
Candle Company brand names; and (3) the Apparel segment, which derives its revenues from the sale of women’s and men’s apparel through Express and Limited Stores.

On March 21, 2002, the Company completed a tax-free tender offer and merger which resulted in the acquisition of the minority
interest of Intimate Brands, Inc. (“IBI”), previously an 84%-owned subsidiary of the Company. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s 2002 Annual Report, incorporated herein by reference, for additional
information regarding this transaction. Following the acquisition of the IBI minority interest, the Company resegmented its business into the three reportable segments discussed above. Previously, the Company’s reportable segments were Intimate
Brands and Apparel. Historical financial information has been reclassified to reflect this new segmentation.

In addition, on November 27, 2002, the Company sold one of its apparel businesses, Lerner New York (“Lerner”), to an investor group led by the business unit’s President and Chief
Executive Officer and affiliates of Bear Stearns Merchant Banking. The Company’s consolidated financial statements reflect Lerner’s operating results as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. See Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in the Company’s 2002 Annual Report, incorporated herein by reference, for additional information regarding this transaction.


The following
chart reflects the retail businesses and the number of stores in operation for each segment at February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002.

RETAIL BUSINESSES

The following table
shows the changes in the number of retail stores operated by the Company for the past five fiscal years:

The Company also owns
Mast Industries, Inc. (“Mast”), a contract manufacturer and apparel importer which purchases merchandise on behalf of the Company and certain third parties. During fiscal year 2002, approximately 35% of the Company’s merchandise
purchases were sourced through Mast. Mast had external sales of $329 million in 2002. Mast’s operating results are included in the Other segment. For additional information, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the
Company’s 2002 Annual Report, incorporated herein by reference.

During fiscal year 2002, the Company purchased merchandise from approximately 2,500 suppliers and factories located throughout the world. In addition to purchases through Mast, the Company purchases merchandise directly in foreign
markets and in the domestic market, some of which is manufactured overseas. The Company purchased approximately 10% of its merchandise from a single supplier, the loss of which would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability
to source its products.

Most of the merchandise and related
materials for the Company’s stores is shipped to the Company’s distribution centers in the Columbus, Ohio area. In connection with the distribution of merchandise, the Company uses a range of shipping terms that result in the transfer of
title to the merchandise at either the point of origin or point of destination.


The Company’s policy is
to maintain sufficient quantities of inventory on hand in its retail stores and distribution centers so that it can offer customers an appropriate selection of current merchandise. The Company emphasizes rapid turnover and takes markdowns as
required to keep merchandise fresh and current with fashion trends.

The Company’s operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: spring (the first and second quarters) and fall (the third and fourth quarters). The fourth quarter, including the holiday season,
accounted for approximately one-third of net sales in 2002, 2001 and 2000. Accordingly, cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as the Company’s inventory builds in anticipation of the holiday season.

Merchandise sales are paid for with cash, by personal check, and with credit
and debit cards issued by third parties, including credit cards issued by Alliance Data Systems, which is approximately 20% owned by the Company.

The Company offers its customers a return policy stated as “No Sale is Ever Final.” The Company believes that certain of its competitors offer
similar service policies.

The following is a brief description
of each of the Company’s Brand businesses, including their respective target markets.

VICTORIA’S SECRET

Victoria’s Secret Stores

—is a leading specialty retailer of women’s intimate apparel and related products. Victoria’s Secret Stores had net sales of $2.647 billion in 2002 and operated 1,014

Secret lingerie stores. Victoria’s Secret Beauty stores and sales are consolidated within Victoria’s Secret Stores in the preceding paragraph and in the 2002 Annual Report.

Victoria’s Secret Direct

—is a leading catalog and e-commerce retailer of women’s intimate and
other apparel. Through its web site, www.VictoriasSecret.com, certain of its products may be purchased worldwide. Victoria’s Secret Direct mailed approximately 394 million catalogs and had net sales of $939 million in 2002.

BATH & BODY WORKS

—is a leading specialty retailer of
personal care products. Launched in 1990, Bath & Body Works, which also operates the White Barn Candle Company, had net sales of $1.781 billion in 2002 and operated 1,639 stores nationwide.

APPAREL BUSINESSES

Express

—is a modern fashion leader for women’s and

Additional information about the Company’s business, including its revenues and profits for the last three years and
selling square footage, is set forth under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” of the 2002 Annual Report and is incorporated herein by reference. For the financial results of the Company’s reportable operating
segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2002 Annual Report, incorporated herein by reference.


COMPETITION.

The sale of intimate and other apparel and personal care
products through retail stores is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors, including individual and chain fashion specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. Brand image, marketing, fashion design, price, service,
fashion selection and quality are the principal competitive factors in retail store sales. The Company’s direct response business competes with numerous national and regional catalog and e-commerce merchandisers. Image presentation, fulfillment
and the factors in retail store sales discussed above are the principal competitive factors in catalog and e-commerce sales.

The Company is unable to estimate the number of competitors or its relative competitive position due to the large number of companies selling apparel and
personal care products through retail stores, catalogs and e-commerce.

ASSOCIATE RELATIONS.

On February 1,
2003, the Company employed approximately 98,900 associates, 70,500 of whom were part-time. In addition, temporary associates are hired during peak periods, such as the holiday season.

AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

The Company’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available,
free of charge, on the Company’s website, www.LimitedBrands.com. These reports are available as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

The Company’s business is principally conducted from office,
distribution and shipping facilities located in the Columbus, Ohio area. Additional facilities are located in New York City, New York; Andover, Massachusetts; Kettering, Ohio; Rio Rancho, New Mexico; Paramus, New Jersey; Hong Kong and London,
England. The Company also operates small sourcing-related office facilities in various foreign locations.

The distribution and shipping facilities owned by the Company consist of seven buildings located in the Columbus, Ohio area. Including attached office space, these buildings comprise approximately 6.1
million square feet.

Substantially all of the retail stores
operated by the Company are located in leased facilities, primarily in shopping centers throughout the continental United States. A substantial portion of these lease commitments consists of store leases generally with an initial term of ten years,
with options to renew at varying terms. The leases expire at various dates between 2003 and 2020.

Typically, when space is leased for a retail store in a shopping center, all improvements, including interior walls, floors, ceilings, fixtures and decorations, are supplied by the tenant. The cost of
improvements varies widely, depending on the design, size and location of the store. In certain cases, the landlord of the property may provide a construction allowance to fund all or a portion of the cost of improvements. Rental terms for new
locations usually include a fixed minimum rent plus a percentage of sales in excess of a specified amount. Certain operating costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, insurance and taxes are typically paid by tenants.


ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

The Company is a defendant in a variety of lawsuits arising
in the ordinary course of business.

On January 13, 1999, two
lawsuits were filed against the Company, as well as other defendants, including many national retailers. Both lawsuits relate to labor practices allegedly employed on the island of Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, by apparel
manufacturers unrelated to the Company (some of which have sold goods to the Company) and seek injunctions, unspecified monetary damages, and other relief. One lawsuit, on behalf of a class of unnamed garment workers, was filed in the United States
District Court for the Central District of California, Western Division and subsequently transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands. It alleged violations of federal statutes, the United States Constitution, and
international law. The second lawsuit was filed by a national labor union and other organizations in the Superior Court of the State of California, San Francisco County, and alleges unfair business practices under California law. On October 31,
2002, the United States District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands granted conditional preliminary approval to a settlement applicable to both cases. A hearing on the final approval of that settlement was held on March 22, 2003. An order has
not yet been issued.

In May and June 1999, purported
shareholders of the Company filed three derivative actions in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, naming as defendants the members of the Company’s board of directors and the Company, as nominal defendant. The actions thereafter
were consolidated. The operative complaint generally alleged that the rescission of the Contingent Stock Redemption Agreement previously entered into by the Company with Leslie H. Wexner and The Wexner Children’s Trust (the “Contingent
Stock Redemption Agreement”) constituted a waste of corporate assets and a breach of the board members’ fiduciary duties, and that the issuer tender offer completed on June 3, 1999 was a “wasteful transaction in its own right.”
On February 16, 2000, plaintiffs filed a first amended consolidated derivative complaint (the “amended complaint”), which made allegations similar to the first complaint but added allegations apparently intended to show that certain
directors were not disinterested in those decisions. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on April 14, 2000 and oral argument was heard on March 28, 2001. On March 27, 2002, the Court granted the motion in part and denied the motion in
part. On May 10, 2002, the Company’s board of directors appointed a special litigation committee composed of directors Donald B. Shackelford and Raymond Zimmerman and granted that committee the authority to investigate the claims asserted in
the amended complaint and to determine the Company’s response to them. On October 31, 2002, the special litigation committee filed a motion on behalf of the Company to dismiss the action on the basis that pursuit of the claims was not in the
best interests of the Company. The individual defendants also filed motions to dismiss on the basis of the Company’s motion. Briefs on these motions are to be submitted to the Court.

Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any litigation, in the opinion of management,
the foregoing proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
