economic conditions; the potential impact of national and international security concerns on the retail environment, including any possible military action, terrorist attacks or other hostilities; our ability to service our debt, any debt we draw
down under our credit facilities, and any other debt we incur, and the restrictions the agreements related to such debt impose upon us; the impact of competition and pricing; changes in weather patterns; political stability; postal rate increases

PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

GENERAL.

Limited Brands, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (including its subsidiaries, the “Company”), sells women’s intimate apparel, personal care and beauty products, and women’s and men’s apparel through its retail stores (primarily mall-based) and direct
response (catalogue and e-commerce) businesses.

DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS.

General

.

As of January 29, 2005, the Company conducted its business in three primary segments: (1)
Victoria’s Secret, which derives its revenues from sales of women’s intimate and other apparel, personal care and beauty products, and accessories marketed under the Victoria’s Secret brand name and sold through its stores and direct
response (catalogue and e-commerce) businesses; (2) Bath & Body Works, which derives its revenues from the sale of personal care products and accessories and home fragrance products marketed under the Bath & Body Works and White Barn Candle
Company brand names as well as from sales of third-party brands; and (3) the Apparel segment, which derives its revenues from the sale of women’s and men’s apparel through Express and Limited Stores.


The following chart reflects the retail businesses and the number of stores in operation for each segment at January 29,
2005 and January 31, 2004.

RETAIL BUSINESSES

The following table shows the changes
in the number of retail stores operated by the Company for the past five fiscal years:

(a)

Represents Lane Bryant stores at August 16, 2001, the date of sale to a third-party.

(b)

Represents New York & Company (formerly Lerner New York) stores at November 27, 2002, the date of sale to a third-party.

The Company also owns Mast Industries, Inc. (“Mast”), a contract manufacturer and
apparel importer which purchases merchandise on behalf of the Company and certain third-parties. Accordingly, Mast is a significant supplier of merchandise for Victoria’s Secret Stores, Victoria’s Secret Direct, Express and Limited Stores.
Mast had external sales of $472 million in 2004. Mast’s operating results are included in the Other segment. For additional information, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s 2004 Annual Report, incorporated
herein by reference.

During fiscal year 2004, the Company purchased
merchandise from over 1,000 suppliers located throughout the world. In addition to purchases through Mast, the Company purchases merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the domestic market, some of which is manufactured overseas. Excluding
Mast, no supplier provided 10% or more of the Company’s merchandise purchases.

Most of the merchandise and related materials for the Company’s stores is shipped to the Company’s distribution centers in the Columbus, Ohio area. In connection with the distribution of merchandise, the Company uses a range of
shipping terms that result in the transfer of title to the merchandise at either the point of origin or point of destination.


The Company’s policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventory on hand in its retail stores and distribution
centers so that it can offer customers an appropriate selection of current merchandise. The Company emphasizes rapid turnover and takes markdowns as required to keep merchandise fresh and current with fashion trends.

The Company’s operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling
seasons: Spring (the first and second quarters) and Fall (the third and fourth quarters). The fourth quarter, including the holiday season, accounted for approximately one-third of net sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002. Accordingly, cash requirements are
highest in the third quarter as the Company’s inventory builds in advance of the holiday season.

The Company and its products are subject to regulation by various Federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities. Our apparel businesses are subject to a variety of customs regulations and
international trade arrangements.

The following is a brief description of each
of the Company’s Brand businesses:

VICTORIA’S SECRET

specialty retailer of women’s intimate apparel and high quality beauty products. Victoria’s Secret Stores had net sales of $3.113 billion in 2004 and operated 1,001 stores nationwide.

retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel and beauty products. Through its website, www.VictoriasSecret.com, certain of its products may be purchased worldwide. Victoria’s Secret Direct mailed approximately 403 million catalogues and

retailer of personal care and home fragrance products. Launched in 1990, Bath & Body Works, which also operates the White Barn Candle Company, had net sales of $2.169 billion in 2004 and operated 1,569 stores nationwide.

APPAREL BUSINESSES

Additional information about the Company’s business, including its revenues and profits for the last three years and selling square footage, is set forth under the caption “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis” of the 2004 Annual Report and is incorporated herein by reference. For the financial results of the Company’s reportable operating segments, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s 2004 Annual
Report, incorporated herein by reference.


COMPETITION.

The sale of intimate apparel, personal care and beauty products, and women’s and men’s apparel through retail stores is a highly competitive business with
numerous competitors, including individual and chain fashion specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. Brand image, marketing, fashion design, price, service, fashion selection and quality are the principal competitive factors in
retail store sales. The Company’s direct response business competes with numerous national and regional catalogue and e-commerce merchandisers. Image presentation, fulfillment and the factors in retail store sales discussed above are the
principal competitive factors in catalogue and e-commerce sales.

The Company
is unable to estimate the number of competitors or its relative competitive position due to the large number of companies selling intimate apparel, personal care and beauty products, and women’s and men’s apparel through retail stores,
catalogues and e-commerce.

ASSOCIATE RELATIONS.

On January 29, 2005, the Company employed approximately 115,300 associates, 95,500 of whom
were part-time. In addition, temporary associates are hired during peak periods, such as the holiday season.

AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

The
Company’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available, free of charge, on the Company’s website, www.LimitedBrands.com. These reports are available
as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

The Company’s business is principally conducted from office, distribution and shipping facilities located in the Columbus, Ohio area. Additional facilities are located in New York City, New York; Kettering, Ohio;
Rio Rancho, New Mexico; Paramus, New Jersey and Hong Kong. The Company also operates small sourcing-related office facilities in various foreign locations.

The distribution and shipping facilities owned by the Company consist of seven buildings located in the Columbus, Ohio area. These buildings, including attached office
space, comprise approximately 6.1 million square feet.

The Company’s
retail stores are located in leased facilities, primarily in malls and shopping centers throughout the continental United States. A substantial portion of these lease commitments consist of store leases generally with an initial term of ten years.
The leases expire at various dates between 2005 and 2021.

Typically, when
space is leased for a retail store in a shopping center, all improvements, including interior walls, floors, ceilings, fixtures and decorations, are supplied by the tenant. The cost of improvements varies widely, depending on the design, size and
location of the store. In certain cases, the landlord of the property may provide a construction allowance to fund all or a portion of the cost of improvements serving as a lease incentive. Rental terms for new locations usually include a fixed
minimum rent plus a percentage of sales in excess of a specified amount. Certain operating costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, insurance and taxes are typically paid by tenants. For additional information, see Note 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s 2004 Annual Report, incorporated herein by reference.


ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

The Company is a defendant in a variety of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any litigation, in the opinion of
management, the Company’s legal proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

In our opinion, the consolidated statements of income, of shareholders’ equity and of cash flows (appearing on pages

is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
