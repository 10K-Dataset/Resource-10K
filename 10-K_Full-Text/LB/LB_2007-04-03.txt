PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

The Company cautions that any forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) contained in this report or made by the Company or management of the Company
involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, the Company’s future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed
or implied in any such forward-looking statements. Words such as “estimate,” “project,” “plan,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “planned,”
“potential” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements.

A number of important factors could cause the results of the
Company to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including those detailed under the heading, “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.

GENERAL.

Limited Brands, Inc. (the “Company” or “we”) operates in the highly competitive
specialty retail business. Our stores are located primarily in the in the United States but we also have international operations. The Company sells women’s intimate apparel, personal care and beauty products, women’s and men’s
apparel and accessories. The Company sells merchandise at its retail stores, which are primarily mall-based, and through e-commerce and catalogue direct response channels.

DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS.

As of February 3, 2007, the Company conducted its business in three primary
segments: Victoria’s Secret, Bath & Body Works and Apparel.

VICTORIA’S SECRET

The Victoria’s Secret segment sells women’s intimate and other apparel, personal care and beauty products and accessories marketed under the Victoria’s
Secret and La Senza brand names. Victoria’s Secret merchandise is sold through retail stores and direct response channels (e-commerce and catalogue). Through its e-commerce site,

www.VictoriasSecret.com

, and catalogue, certain of
Victoria’s Secret’s merchandise may be purchased worldwide.

In January 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of La Senza Corporation
(“La Senza”) for $600 million. La Senza is a Canadian specialty retailer offering lingerie and sleepwear as well as apparel for girls in the 7-14 year age group. In addition, independently owned La Senza stores operate in 34 other
countries. The acquisition of La Senza supports our objective of enhancing our capabilities to pursue our strategic growth goals internationally. The results of La Senza are included in the Victoria’s Secret segment. For additional information
see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The Victoria’s Secret
segment had net sales of $5.139 billion in 2006 and operated 1,003 stores in the United States and 323 stores in Canada.

BATH & BODY WORKS

The Bath & Body Works segment sells personal care, beauty and home fragrance products marketed under the Bath & Body Works, C.O.
Bigelow and White Barn Candle Company brand names in addition to third-party



brands. Bath & Body Works merchandise is sold at retail stores, through its e-commerce site,

www.bathandbodyworks.com

, and catalogue.

Bath & Body Works, which also operates C.O. Bigelow and the White Barn Candle Company stores, had net sales of $2.556 billion in 2006 and
operated 1,546 stores nationwide.

APPAREL BUSINESSES

The Apparel segment sells women’s and men’s apparel through Express and Limited Stores.

Express is a specialty retailer positioned as a
young, sexy and sophisticated brand for both work and casual wear among fashion forward women and men. Express had net sales of $1.749 billion in 2006 and operated 658 stores nationwide.

Limited Stores is a mall-based specialty store retailer. Limited Stores’ strategy is to focus on sophisticated sportswear for modern American women. Limited Stores had net sales of $493 million in 2006 and
operated 260 stores nationwide.

OTHER

Henri
Bendel operates two specialty stores in New York, New York and Columbus, Ohio which feature fashion and personal care products for sophisticated women. The business had net sales of $42 million in 2006. The Company also operates six Diva London
stores which sell accessories to a target market of women ages 18 to 34.

Additional information about the Company’s business, including its net sales
and profits for the last three years and selling square footage, is set forth under Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. For the financial results of the Company’s reportable
operating segments, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The following chart
reflects the retail businesses and the number of company operated stores in operation for each business at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006.



(a)

As of February 3, 2007, the Company also has global representation through 339 independently owned “La Senza” and “La Senza Girl” stores operating in 34
countries under 12 license agreements.

The following table shows the changes in the number of retail stores operated by the Company for the
past five fiscal years:

(a)

Represents New York & Company (formerly Lerner New York) stores at November 27, 2002, the date of sale to a third-party.

(b)

Represents the stores acquired in the La Senza acquisition on January 12, 2007.

The Company also owns Mast Industries, Inc. (“Mast”), an apparel importer which is a significant supplier of merchandise for Victoria’s Secret, Express and Limited Stores. The Company also owns Beauty
Avenues (“Beauty Avenues”), a personal care sourcing company serving both Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works. Mast and Beauty Avenues also have $650 million of sales to third-parties in 2006 and their operating results
are included in Other in our segment reporting. For additional information, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

During fiscal year 2006, the Company purchased merchandise from over 1,000 suppliers located throughout the world. In addition to purchases through Mast and Beauty
Avenues, the Company purchases merchandise directly in foreign and domestic markets. Excluding Mast and Beauty Avenues, no supplier provided 10% or more of the Company’s merchandise purchases.

Most of the merchandise and related materials for the Company’s stores are shipped to the Company’s distribution centers in the Columbus, Ohio area. In
connection with the distribution of merchandise, the Company uses a variety of shipping terms that result in the transfer of title to the merchandise at either the point of origin or point of destination.

The Company’s policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventory on hand in its retail stores and distribution centers so that it can offer customers an
appropriate selection of current merchandise. The Company emphasizes rapid turnover and takes markdowns as required to keep merchandise fresh and current with fashion trends.

The Company’s operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: Spring (the first and second quarters) and Fall (the third and fourth quarters). The fourth quarter, including the
holiday season, accounted for approximately one-third of net sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Accordingly, cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as the Company’s inventory builds in advance of the holiday season.

The Company and its products are subject to regulation by various Federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities. The Company is subject to a variety of
customs regulations and international trade arrangements.

The Company’s trademarks and patents, which constitute its primary intellectual property,
have been registered or are the subject of pending applications in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law. The Company believes that its



products and services are identified by its intellectual property and, thus, its intellectual property is of significant value. Accordingly, we intend to
maintain our intellectual property and related registrations and vigorously protect our intellectual property assets against infringement.

COMPETITION.

The sale of intimate apparel, personal care and beauty products, women’s and men’s apparel and accessories through retail stores is a highly
competitive business with numerous competitors, including individual and chain fashion specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. Brand image, marketing, fashion design, price, service, fashion assortment and quality are the
principal competitive factors in retail store sales. The Company’s direct response businesses compete with numerous national and regional e-commerce and catalogue merchandisers. Image presentation, fulfillment and the factors affecting retail
store sales discussed above are the principal competitive factors in e-commerce and catalogue sales.

The Company is unable to estimate the number of
competitors or its relative competitive position due to the large number of companies selling intimate apparel, personal care and beauty products, women’s and men’s apparel and accessories through retail stores, catalogues and e-commerce.

ASSOCIATE RELATIONS.

On February 3, 2007, the
Company employed approximately 125,500 associates, 105,100 of whom were part-time. In addition, temporary associates are hired during peak periods, such as the holiday season.

AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

The Company’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K, amendments to those reports and code of conduct are available, free of charge, on the Company’s website, www.LimitedBrands.com. These reports are available as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is
electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

The following discussion of risk factors contains “forward-looking statements,” as
discussed in Item 1. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K, other filings or in any other discussions of the Company’s business. The following information should be read in conjunction with
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect the
Company’s business, financial condition or future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also
adversely affect the business, financial condition and/or operating results of the Company in a material way.

The Company’s revenue and profit
results are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending patterns.

The Company’s
growth, sales and profitability may be adversely affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of
national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. Purchases of women’s and men’s apparel, women’s intimate apparel, personal care and beauty products and accessories often decline during
periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. In such circumstances, the Company may increase the number of promotional sales, which would further adversely affect its profitability.



The Company’s net sales, operating income and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis.

The Company experiences major seasonal fluctuations in its net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of its operating income typically realized during
the fourth quarter holiday season. Any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionate effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.

Seasonal fluctuations also affect the Company’s inventory levels, since it usually orders merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new
fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. The Company must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. If the Company is not successful in selling inventory, it may have to sell the
inventory at significantly reduced prices or it may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which in each case may further adversely affect profitability.

The Company may be unable to compete favorably in its highly competitive segment of the retail industry.

The sale of intimate and other
apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. The Company competes for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain fashion specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. In
addition to the traditional store-based retailers, the Company also competes with direct marketers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through e-commerce and catalogue. Direct marketers also include traditional
store-based retailers like the Company who are competing in the e-commerce and catalogue distribution channels. The Company’s direct response businesses compete with numerous national and regional e-commerce and catalogue merchandisers. Brand
image, marketing, fashion design, price, service, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and direct response channels.

Some of the Company’s competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available to them. In many cases, the Company’s competitors sell their products in department stores that are
located in the same shopping malls as the Company’s stores. In addition to competing for sales, the Company competes for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls.

Increased competition could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and
results of operations.

The Company may not be able to keep up with fashion trends and may not be able to launch new product lines successfully.

The Company’s success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion tastes and consumer
demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product offerings far in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. Customer tastes and fashion trends change rapidly. If the Company is unable to successfully anticipate,
identify or react to changing styles or trends and misjudges the market for its products or any new product lines, the Company’s sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. In response,
the Company may be forced to increase its marketing promotions or price markdowns, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. The Company’s brand image may also suffer if customers believe merchandise misjudgments indicate that
the Company is no longer able to identify and offer the latest fashions.

The Company may lose key personnel.

The Company believes that it has benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of its senior executives, including Leslie H. Wexner (its Chairman of the
Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer). The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on the business and prospects of the Company. Competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense
and the Company’s future success will also depend on its ability to recruit, train and retain other qualified personnel.



The Company’s manufacturers may be unable to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner or meet quality
standards.

The Company purchases products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from third-party manufacturers. Similar to most
other specialty retailers, the Company has narrow sales window periods for much of its inventory. Factors outside the Company’s control, such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and
result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.

The Company relies significantly on foreign sources of production and maintains operations in foreign countries.

The
Company purchases apparel merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the domestic market, some of which is manufactured overseas. The Company does not have any material long-term merchandise supply contracts and many of its imports are subject
to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas. The Company competes with other companies for production facilities and import quota capacity.

The Company also faces a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as:

•

political instability;

•

imposition of new legislation or rules relating to imports that may limit the quantity of goods which may be imported into the United States from countries in a particular region;

•

imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports;

•

currency and exchange risks;

•

local business practice and political issues, including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards which may result in adverse publicity;

•

potential delays or disruptions in shipping and related pricing impacts; and

•

disruption of imports by labor disputes.

New initiatives may be proposed
that may have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which, if enacted, would limit or reduce the products purchased from suppliers in such countries.

In addition, significant health hazards or environmental or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies, financial markets and
business activity. The Company’s purchases of merchandise from these manufacturing operations may be affected by this risk.

The future performance of
the Company will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond its control. These factors may have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company.

The Company depends on a high volume of mall traffic and the availability of suitable lease space.

Many of the
Company’s stores are located in shopping malls. Sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the high volume of traffic in those malls. The Company’s stores benefit from the ability of the mall’s “anchor” tenants,
generally large department stores, and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of its stores and the continuing popularity of malls as shopping destinations. Sales volume and mall traffic may be adversely affected by
economic downturns in a particular area, competition from non-mall retailers and other



malls where the Company does not have stores and the closing of anchor department stores. In addition, a decline in the desirability of the shopping
environment in a particular mall, or a decline in the popularity of mall shopping among the Company’s target consumers, would adversely affect its business.

Part of the Company’s future growth is significantly dependent on its ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs that allow the Company to earn a reasonable return. The Company cannot be
sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs.

The Company may face labor shortages or increased labor
costs which could adversely affect its growth and operating results.

Labor is a significant component in the cost of operating the Company’s
stores. If the Company faces labor shortages or increased labor costs because of increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover rates, increases in the federal minimum wage or increases in other employee benefits costs, its operating
expenses could increase and its growth could be adversely affected. The Company’s success depends in part upon its ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees.

Increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing may affect the Company’s business.

Postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of the Company’s order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings. The Company relies on discounts from the basic postal rate
structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. Future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact the Company’s earnings if it was unable to pass such increases directly onto its customers or by implementing more
efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems.

The Company’s stock price may be volatile.

The Company’s stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of the Company or
other companies in the retail industry or markets served by the Company. In addition, the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been
unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies.

The Company may be unable to service its debt.

The Company may be unable to service the debt drawn under its credit facilities and/or any other debt it incurs. Additionally, the agreements related to such debt require
the Company to maintain certain financial ratios which limit the total amount the Company may borrow, and also prohibit certain types of liens on property or assets.

The Company is implementing certain changes to its IT systems that may disrupt operations.

The Company is currently
implementing modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for merchandise, distribution, e-commerce and support systems, including finance. Modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to
legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. The Company is aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions. The launch of these successor systems will
take place in a phased approach over an approximate five year period that began in 2005. Information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
operations.



The Company relies significantly on its information technology systems.

The Company’s success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of its information technology systems. The Company’s computer systems as
well as those of its service providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security measures, some of the Company’s
servers and those of its service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Despite the precautions the Company has taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause
failures in the Company’s information technology systems. Sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt the Company’s ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores in a timely manner could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s operations, controls and reporting.

The Company’s results can be adversely affected by market disruptions.

Market disruptions due to severe weather conditions, natural disasters, health hazards, terrorist activities or the prospect of these events can affect
consumer spending and confidence levels and adversely affect the Company’s results or prospects in affected markets. The receipt of proceeds under any insurance the Company maintains for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be
insufficient to fully offset its losses.

The Company’s results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price of oil.

Prices of oil have fluctuated dramatically in the past. These fluctuations may result in an increase in the Company’s transportation costs for distribution, utility
costs for its retail stores and costs to purchase product from its manufacturers. A continual rise in oil prices could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for the Company’s products and increase its operating costs, both of which
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.

The Company’s licensees could take
actions that could harm our business or brands.

The Company has global representation through independently owned La Senza stores operating under
license agreements. Although we have criteria to evaluate and screen prospective licensees, we are limited in the amount of control we can exercise over our licensees and the quality of licensed operations may be diminished by any number of factors
beyond our control. Licensees may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. Our
brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our licensees do not operate successfully.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

Not applicable.



ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

The following table sets forth the location, use and size of the Company’s distribution,
corporate and product development facilities as of February 3, 2007:

United States

The Company’s business is principally conducted from office, distribution and shipping facilities located in the Columbus, Ohio area. Additional facilities are located in New York, New York; Kettering, Ohio; Rio Rancho, New Mexico; and
Paramus, New Jersey.

The distribution and shipping facilities owned by the Company consist of seven buildings located in the Columbus, Ohio area. These
buildings, including attached office space, comprise approximately 6.1 million square feet.

As of February 3, 2007, the Company operates 3,475
retail stores in the United States, located in leased facilities, primarily in malls and shopping centers. A substantial portion of these lease commitments consist of store leases generally with an initial term of ten years. The leases expire at
various dates between 2007 and 2022.

Typically, when space is leased for a retail store in a shopping center, all improvements, including interior walls,
floors, ceilings, fixtures and decorations, are supplied by the Company. The cost of improvements varies widely, depending on the design, size and location of the store. In certain cases, the landlord of the property may provide a construction
allowance to fund all or a portion of the cost of improvements serving as a lease incentive. Rental terms for new locations usually include a fixed minimum rent plus a percentage of sales in excess of a specified amount. Certain operating costs such
as common area maintenance, utilities, insurance and taxes are typically paid by the Company. For additional information, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

International

Canada

The Company’s international business is principally conducted from owned and leased office, distribution and shipping facilities located in the Montreal, Quebec
area. Additional leased office facilities are located in Toronto, Ontario.

The distribution and shipping facilities owned by the Company consist of two
buildings located in the Montreal area. These buildings, including attached office space, comprise approximately 276,000 square feet. Additionally, the Company leases additional office facilities in the Montreal area comprised of approximately
100,000 square feet.

As of February 3, 2007, the Company operates 323 retail stores located in leased facilities, primarily in malls and shopping
centers throughout the Canadian provinces. A substantial portion of these lease commitments consist of store leases generally with an initial term of ten years. The leases expire at various dates between 2007 and 2020.

The Company also operates small sourcing-related office facilities in various foreign locations.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

The Company is a defendant in a variety of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of
business. Plaintiffs may seek to recover large and sometimes unspecified amounts or other types of relief and some matters may remain unresolved for several years. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any
litigation, in the opinion of management, the Company’s legal proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

On January 29, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS
No. 123(R)”), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date. See additional discussion in Note 13 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.



The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) was $0.7 million, net of tax of $0.4 million, and
was recognized as an increase to net income in the Consolidated Statement of Income as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2006.

(c)

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company changed its inventory valuation method. Previously, inventories were principally valued at the lower of cost or market, on a
weighted-average cost basis, using the retail method. Commencing in 2005, inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or market, on a weighted-average cost basis, using the cost method. See additional discussion in Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The cumulative effect of this
change was $17 million, net of tax of $11 million. This change was recognized as an increase to net income in the Consolidated Statement of Income as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2005. In addition to the $17 million cumulative impact
recognized as of the beginning of the first quarter, the effect of the change during 2005 was to decrease net income by $4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share.

(d)

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.

The following
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. This should be read in conjunction with these statements and the notes thereto which are included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Executive Overview

Limited Brands, Inc. (the “Company” or “we”) operates in the highly
competitive specialty retail business. The Company sells women’s intimate apparel, personal care and beauty products, women’s and men’s apparel and accessories. The Company sells merchandise at its retail stores, which are primarily
mall-based, and through direct response channels (e-commerce and catalogue).

Strategy

The Company’s strategy centers on its mission to build a family of the world’s best fashion retail brands whose well-told stories create loyal customers and deliver sustained growth for our stakeholders. The
strategy will be executed using differentiated capabilities including merchant vision, retail experiences, portfolio management, open innovation, talent management and enterprise infrastructure that allows the Company to deliver quality products to
the customer cost-effectively and efficiently. The Company is focused on offering emotionally engaging shopping experiences driven by a differentiated and relevant assortment of product brands. Our brands represent a multi-dimensional portfolio
competing across multiple categories, channels, customer segments and geographies.

To execute the strategy, the Company
is focused on six key strategic imperatives:

1) Growth of core retail brands in current channels and geographies, focusing on growth through comparable
store sales increases and sales productivity gains within our current footprint. In addition, we will continue to close unproductive Apparel stores and convert Express single gender stores to dual gender formats.

2) Expansion of core retail brands into new channels and geographies, seeking to expand the Company’s presence beyond its current footprint by increasing store
count and square footage at Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works and through international expansion. Based on favorable returns from larger Victoria’s Secret store formats, in 2007 we will begin implementing a plan to increase
the square footage of our average Victoria’s Secret store by about 50%. Specifically, the Company plans to open 35 new stores and remodel another 105 stores to the new larger store design. We anticipate total square footage will increase
between 8% and 10% in 2007. At Bath & Body Works, we plan to open approximately 55 new stores in 2007, resulting in a square footage increase of approximately 3%. The 2006 acquisition of La Senza extends the Company’s presence into
Canada and provides an international network in 34 other countries as the Company begins to contemplate international expansion for our other brands. We plan to open 32 new La Senza stores in 2007, resulting in square footage growth of 12%.

3) Incubation and growth of new concepts, including PINK, Intimissimi, White Barn Candle Company, C.O. Bigelow and accessories at Henri Bendel and
Diva London.

4) Investment in infrastructure to support future growth, focusing on two primary initiatives:

•

The enterprise-wide multi-year project to standardize and upgrade our technology in three areas: shared services, customer relationship marketing and supply chain
management;

•

Construction of a new distribution facility and development of new front-end technology to support the growth of our direct businesses.



5) Attracting, developing and retaining talent across all disciplines.

6) Proactive management of our capital structure, focusing on the continued return of excess free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases,
while also making incremental investments back into the business to support all of the previously described imperatives.

Summary of 2006 Results

The Company’s operating results are generally impacted by changes in the overall U.S. economy, and therefore, management monitors the retail
environment using, among other things, certain key industry performance indicators such as the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (which measures consumers’ views on the future course of the U.S. economy), the National Retail
Traffic Index (which measures traffic levels in approximately 250 malls nationwide) and National Retail Sales (which reflects sales volumes of 5,000 businesses as measured by the U.S. Census Bureau). These indices provide insight into consumer
spending patterns and shopping behavior in the current retail environment and assist management in assessing the Company’s performance as well as the potential impact of industry trends on its future operating results.

We utilize the retail calendar for reporting. As such, the results for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 represent the fifty-three week period ended February 3, 2007
and the fifty-two week periods ended January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, respectively. The 2006 fourth quarter consists of a fourteen week period versus a thirteen week period in 2005. The extra week accounted for approximately $171
million, or 5%, in incremental sales in the fourth quarter.

For the fifty-three week year ended February 3, 2007, operating income increased 19%
primarily due to a significant improvement in operating income at Express. Operating income also increased at Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works. For the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2007, operating income increased 5%
due to increases in all operating segments.

Victoria’s Secret’s increase in sales and operating income for the year and fourth quarter were
driven by continued sales growth in the PINK sub-brand and new bra launches that featured the Secret Embrace and Infinity Edge technologies. Sales growth outpaced operating income performance as the brand focused on initiatives to drive customer
trial, increase customer loyalty and increase market share.

Bath & Body Works’ increase in sales and operating income for the year and
fourth quarter were driven by increases in newly introduced Signature Collection fragrances and expense leverage across all categories.

Although Apparel
experienced decreases in sales in the year and fourth quarter, its operating income improved significantly during the year and fourth quarter driven by a significant improvement in gross profit at Express. Express reasserted itself with its customer
by offering a more fashionable merchandise assortment with appropriate price points.

Net Sales

Fourth Quarter

compared to 2005



At Victoria’s Secret, the 10% increase in comparable store sales and in total sales was driven by growth in the PINK
sub-brand as well as growth in sleepwear, core lingerie and beauty categories. The growth in PINK was driven by loungewear, panties and accessories, while the growth in core lingerie was driven by bras. The growth in the bra category was driven by
new products featuring the Secret Embrace and Infinity Edge technologies. Growth in beauty was the result of continued momentum of the Dream Angles Desire fragrance and the Beauty Rush color line. Victoria’s Secret Direct achieved an 18%
increase in sales driven by double digit growth in intimate apparel and clothing.

At Bath & Body Works, the 9% increase in comparable store sales
was primarily driven by increases in the Signature Collection due to the introduction of new fragrances as well as strong sales performance during the semi-annual sale which was extended into mid-January. Incremental sales from the Temptations
product line and continued growth of the Dr. Wexler product line launched during the third quarter of 2005 also contributed to sales growth.

At the
Apparel businesses, the 1% increase in comparable store sales was driven by a 3% increase at Express. The increase at Express was primarily due to increased sales in sweaters and woven tops, a strong clearance event and a favorable response to early
Spring merchandise. Limited Stores experienced a 4% decrease in comparable store sales, primarily driven by significant declines in woven tops and sweaters, offset partially by increases in jackets, skirts, woven shirts and dresses.

The net increase in sales in other was primarily driven by an increase in Mast sales to third-party customers.

2005 compared to 2004

At Victoria’s Secret, the 3% increase in comparable store sales and in total sales was driven by growth in
the PINK sub-brand and in the bra and body care categories, partially offset by declines in panties, prestige fragrance and sleepwear. The growth in the bra category was driven by the Body by Victoria Bra event in December and the launch of the
Angel’s Secret Embrace Bra. Victoria’s Secret Direct achieved a 15% increase in sales driven by growth in intimate apparel, beauty and sleepwear.

At Bath & Body Works, the 1% increase in comparable store sales was primarily driven by incremental sales from the launch of the American Girl and Breathe Body Care product lines during 2005, as well as by products launched last
year, including C.O. Bigelow and Le Couvent des Minimes. Declines in the fragrant body care and home fragrance product lines partially offset its sales increase. An increase in gift-with-purchase and purchase-with-purchase promotions also partially
supported the sales increases.

At the Apparel businesses, the 4% increase in comparable store sales was driven by a 6% increase at Express. The increase
at Express can be primarily attributed to increased sales in denim and knit tops as the focus shifted to a more balanced offering between casual and wear-to-work, with appropriate price points. Decreases in pants and sweaters partially offset these
increases. Limited Stores experienced a 1% decrease in comparable store sales, primarily driven by significant declines in pants and woven tops.



The Company issues gift cards which contain no expiration dates or inactivity fees. The Company recognizes income from
gift cards when: (i) the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote and it is determined that there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to
relevant jurisdictions (gift card breakage). During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recognized $30 million of net sales and operating income ($0.04 per share) related to gift card breakage at Bath & Body Works ($16 million) and
Express ($14 million). The amount of gift card breakage recognized was based upon analysis of historical redemption patterns and represents the portion of remaining balance of gift cards for which the Company believes the likelihood of redemption is
remote. The fourth quarter of 2005 is the first period during which the Company has recognized gift card breakage. Therefore, the amount recognized includes the breakage income related to gift cards sold since inception of the gift card programs at
Bath & Body Works and Express. The Company will recognize gift card breakage at its other divisions once adequate historical data has been accumulated.

The net sales increase in other was primarily driven by an increase in volume of Mast sales to third-party customers versus the fourth quarter of 2004.

Net Sales

Full Year

2006 compared
to 2005

At Victoria’s Secret, both the increase in comparable store sales of 11% and the increase in total sales were
driven by growth in all categories, including core lingerie, beauty and the PINK sub-brand. The sales were supported by several bra launches throughout the year, including the Angels Secret Embrace, Body by Victoria IPEX Wireless, Very Sexy Infinity
Edge Push-up and Secret Embrace Demi. The increase in the beauty category was primarily driven by continued growth in the Garden body care line and incremental sales from beauty launches, including Very Sexy Make Up, Beauty Rush Lip Gloss and Eye
Shadows and Dream Angels Desire fragrance. The 16% increase in sales at Victoria’s Secret Direct was driven by growth across all major categories.

At
Bath & Body Works, the 10% increase in comparable store sales was primarily driven by increases in the Signature Collection due to the introduction of new fragrances more frequently throughout the year. Additionally, incremental sales from
the Temptations product line and continued growth in the Dr. Wexler, Antibacterial and Breathe Body Care product lines contributed to sales growth.

At the Apparel business, the 2% decrease in comparable store sales primarily resulted from declines during the first three quarters of the year. At Express, these results reflect the impact of the significant promotional and clearance
activity that occurred in 2005. The 4% decline in Limited Stores comparable store sales was driven by declines in pants, sweaters and woven tops, partially offset by increases in dresses, jackets and skirts.

The net sales increase in other was primarily driven by an increase in volume of Mast sales to third-party customers versus 2005.



2005 compared to 2004

At Victoria’s Secret, the increase in comparable store sales of 1% and the increase in total sales were
driven by growth in the PINK sub-brand and the bra and body care categories, partially offset by declines in the sleepwear, panty and prestige fragrance categories. The growth in the bra category was driven by sales of the IPEX and the Very Sexy bra
sub-brand. The 10% increase in net sales at Victoria’s Secret Direct was driven by growth in almost all product categories, including woven tops, bras, knit tops and beauty.

At Bath & Body Works, the 4% increase in comparable store sales was primarily driven by incremental sales from new product lines, including Tutti Dolci, C.O. Bigelow, Le Couvent des Minimes, Breathe Body Care
and American Girl and recognition of gift card breakage in the fourth quarter, partially offset by declines in the fragrant body care and home fragrance product lines. This result was supported by a successful semi-annual sale during the second
quarter and purchase-with-purchase promotions.

At the Apparel businesses, the 6% decrease in comparable store sales primarily resulted from significant
declines at Express related to the product assortment issues during the first three quarters of the year. All major Express categories experienced declines as compared to last year except for knits and denim. These results reflect a continuation of
sales declines at Express which began in the Fall of 2004. Express’ product assortment failed to meet customer preferences both in terms of fashion selection and price points. The 2% decline in comparable store sales at Limited Stores was
primarily driven by declines in sweaters, skirts and jackets, partially offset by growth in denim, pants and accessories.

The net sales increase in other
was primarily driven by an increase in volume of Mast sales to third-party customers versus 2004.

Gross Profit

Fourth Quarter

2006 compared to 2005

For the fourth quarter of 2006, the gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 40.1% from 40.8% in 2005 driven by a decline in merchandise
margin partially offset by buying and occupancy expense leverage.

At Victoria’s Secret, the gross profit rate decreased primarily due to a reduction
in merchandise margin rates, partially offset by an improvement in the buying and occupancy expense rate. The reduction in merchandise margin rate was driven by increased markdowns due to the clearance of selected merchandise that missed sales
expectations and increased levels of promotional direct mailings to drive an increase in market share. The merchandise margin rate also declined partially due to a shift in the mix of business from core lingerie and beauty to PINK, loungewear and
sleepwear and the expansion of the Company’s multiple pricing offers for panties. Additionally, buying and occupancy expense was leveraged on a 10% increase in comparable store sales.



At Bath & Body Works, the gross profit rate decreased compared to last year driven by a decrease in merchandise
margin rate partially offset by leverage in buying and occupancy. The reduction in merchandise margin rate to last year was driven by a mix of promotional transaction driving activity and better than expected performance of the semi-annual sale.
Additionally, buying and occupancy expense was leveraged on a 9% increase in comparable store sales.

At the Apparel businesses, the gross profit rate
increased due to improvement in merchandise margin at Express. The improvement in merchandise margin rate was driven by lower product costs and reduced markdowns. Additionally, buying and occupancy expense was leveraged on a 1% increase in
comparable store sales.

2005 compared to 2004

For the
fourth quarter of 2005, the gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) increased to 40.8% from 39.1% in 2004 driven by a decrease in the buying and occupancy rate primarily related to a $61 million lease related accounting charge in
the fourth quarter of 2004 and the Company’s initial recognition of gift card breakage of $30 million (as previously discussed).

At Victoria’s
Secret, the gross profit rate increased due to improvement in the buying and occupancy expense rate, partially offset by a reduction in merchandise margin rates. The reduction in the merchandise margin rate was driven by the change to the
weighted-average cost method of accounting for inventory valuation and lower margins at the beauty business. The declines at the beauty business were driven by lower margin gift set sales in December and increased markdowns during the semi-annual
sale, primarily in the color product line. Buying and occupancy expense was higher in 2004 as compared to 2005 due to the one-time lease accounting correction. Additionally, buying and occupancy expense was leveraged on a 3% increase in comparable
store sales.

At Bath & Body Works, the gross profit rate increased due to improvement in the buying and occupancy expense rate, partially offset
by a reduction in the merchandise margin rate. The reduction in the merchandise margin rate was due to higher markdowns and purchase-with-purchase promotions to stimulate traffic, partially offset by the Company’s initial recognition of gift
card breakage. Buying and occupancy expense was higher in 2004 as compared to 2005 due to the one-time lease accounting correction. Additionally, buying and occupancy expense was leveraged on a 1% increase in comparable store sales.

At the Apparel businesses, the gross profit rate increased over last year due to improvement in the buying and occupancy rate, partially offset by a reduction in the
merchandise margin rate at Express. The reduction in the merchandise margin rate was driven by the change to the weighted-average cost method of accounting for inventory valuation that more than offset an increase in merchandise margin due to lower
markdowns and initial recognition of gift card breakage at Express. The buying and occupancy expense was higher in 2004 as compared to 2005 due to the one-time lease accounting correction. Additionally, buying and occupancy expense was leveraged on
a 4% increase in comparable store sales.

Gross Profit

Full Year

2006 compared to 2005

In
2006, the gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) increased to 37.6% from 35.9% in 2005 driven by an increase in the merchandise margin rate at the Apparel brands offset partially by a decline in the merchandise margin rate at
Victoria’s Secret. The buying and occupancy expense rate improved across all operating segments driven primarily by leverage achieved at Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works on double digit comparable store sales increases at
both brands.

At Victoria’s Secret, the gross profit rate decreased due to a reduction in the merchandise margin rate driven by markdowns associated
with strategic marketing activities designed to drive trial, build brand loyalty and increase market share. The reduction in the merchandise margin rate was partially offset by buying and occupancy expense leverage achieved on a 11% increase in
comparable store sales.



At Bath & Body Works, the gross profit rate was flat compared to last year. The buying and occupancy expense
rate improved, but was offset by a reduction in the merchandise margin rate. The reduction in the merchandise margin rate was due to increased promotional activity to drive transactions and the performance of the semi-annual sale events. Buying and
occupancy expense was leveraged on a 10% increase in comparable store sales.

At the Apparel businesses, the gross profit rate increased significantly over
last year driven by lower product costs and reduced markdowns at Express. Additionally, buying and occupancy expense was leveraged despite the 2% decline in comparable store sales.

2005 compared to 2004

In 2005, the gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 35.9%
from 36.1% in 2004 driven by a decrease in the merchandise margin rate at the Apparel brands. This decline was offset by a decrease in the buying and occupancy expense rate (primarily related to a $61 million lease related accounting charge across
the enterprise in the fourth quarter of 2004), the Company’s initial recognition of gift card breakage of $30 million and expense leverage achieved at Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works on sales increases of 5% at both
brands.

At Victoria’s Secret, the gross profit rate increased due to improvement in the buying and occupancy expense rate, partially offset by a
reduction in the merchandise margin rate. The slight reduction in the merchandise margin rate was driven by markdowns in panties and beauty. Buying and occupancy expense was higher in 2004 compared to 2005 due to the one-time lease accounting
correction. Additionally, buying and occupancy expense was leveraged on a 1% increase in comparable store sales.

At Bath & Body Works, the gross
profit rate was flat compared to last year. The buying and occupancy expense rate improved, but was offset by a reduction in the merchandise margin rate. The reduction in the merchandise margin rate was due to higher markdowns on gift sets and
purchase-with-purchase promotions to stimulate traffic. Buying and occupancy expense was higher in 2004 due to the one-time lease accounting correction. Additionally, buying and occupancy expense was leveraged on a 4% increase in comparable store
sales.

At the Apparel businesses, the gross profit rate decreased over last year due to a decrease in the merchandise margin rate, partially offset by an
improvement in the buying and occupancy rate at both Express and Limited Stores. The decrease in the merchandise margin rate was driven by significantly higher markdowns through the first three quarters to clear slow-moving inventories across many
product categories. Buying and occupancy expense was higher in 2004 due to the one-time lease accounting correction, offset by the inability to leverage expenses due to a 6% decline in comparable store sales.

General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses

Fourth
Quarter

2006 compared to 2005

For the fourth
quarter of 2006, the general, administrative and store operating expense rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) increased to 22.0% from 21.2% last year, driven by incremental spending on technology and process initiatives to support future
growth, higher incentive compensation which is tied to improved performance for the Fall season, and incremental stock option expense related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).

2005 compared to 2004

For the fourth quarter of 2005, the general, administrative and store operating expense rate
(expressed as a percentage of net sales) increased to 21.2% from 20.2% last year, driven by an increase in investments in new



growth concepts, increased spending on technology and process initiatives to support future growth and an increase in marketing expense. The increase in
marketing spending related to the Victoria Secret’s fashion show, PINK, Express television media and advertising and marketing programs at Bath & Body Works to support new product lines. These increases were partially offset by an $8.5
million favorable litigation settlement with respect to merchant fees previously paid to Visa and MasterCard.

General, Administrative and Store
Operating Expenses

Full Year

2006 compared to

In 2006, the general, administrative and store operating expense rate increased to 26.6% from 25.7% in 2005. The increase was primarily driven by:
1) increased marketing expenses primarily at Victoria’s Secret; 2) increases in incentive compensation expense due to improved performance; 3) investments in technology and process improvement initiatives to support future growth; and 4)
incremental stock compensation expense related to the Company’s adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (R).

compared to 2004

In 2005, the general, administrative and store operating expense rate increased to 25.7% from 25.2% in 2004. The increase was
primarily driven by investments in new growth concepts, increased spending on technology and process initiatives to support future growth, and incremental expenses associated with the Victoria Secret’s fashion show and PINK. The increases were
offset by decreases in incentive compensation and an $8.5 million favorable litigation settlement with respect to merchant fees previously paid to Visa and MasterCard.

Interest Expense

The average daily borrowings and average borrowing rates for the fourth quarters and years ended
February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006, and January 29, 2005 were as follows:

In 2006, the Company incurred interest expense of $28 million and $102 million for the fourth quarter and the
year, respectively, compared to $25 million and $94 million for the same periods in 2005. The fourth quarter increase was driven by an increase in average borrowings and the average borrowing rates partially offset by a reduction in the bank
facility fee from 0.15% to 0.10% of the committed amount per year. The increase in average borrowings resulted primarily from the issuance of commercial paper. The full year increase resulted from an increase in average borrowings and the average
borrowing rate (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).

In 2005, the Company
incurred interest expense of $25 million and $94 million for the fourth quarter and the year, respectively, compared to $21 million and $58 million for the same periods in 2004. The fourth quarter increase was driven by an increase in average
borrowings and the average borrowing rate. The full year increase resulted from an increase in average borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in average effective borrowing rates resulting from the addition of the Company’s 5.25% $500
million notes during the third quarter of 2004 and $500 million variable rate term loan during the fourth quarter of 2004 (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).



Interest Income

In
2006, interest income was $4 million and $25 million for the fourth quarter and the full year, respectively, compared to $49 million and $62 million for the same periods in 2005. The decrease in both the fourth quarter and the year was primarily the
result of a $40 million tax settlement in 2005 (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) and decreases in the average invested cash balances.

In 2005, interest income was $49 million and $62 million for the fourth quarter and the full year, respectively, compared to $7 million and $30 million for the same
periods in 2004. The increase in both the fourth quarter and year was driven by interest of $40 million related to a tax settlement.

Other Income
(Loss)

In 2006, other income (loss) for the fourth quarter and the year was $2 million and $(2) million, respectively, compared to $4 million and $3
million for the same periods in 2005.

In 2005, other income (loss) for the fourth quarter and the year was $4 million and $3 million, respectively,
compared to $4 million and $99 million for the same periods in 2004. The full year decrease primarily relates to gains in 2004 of $90 million related to the early collection of the New York & Company note receivable, New York &
Company’s purchase of its warrants held by the Company and additional proceeds from the New York & Company initial public offering (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data).

Gains on Sale of Investees’ Stock

During the second quarter of 2004, the Company sold its remaining ownership interest in Galyan’s Trading Company, Inc. (“Galyan’s”) for $65 million, resulting in a pretax gain of $18 million. Prior to the sale of
Galyan’s shares, the Company accounted for its investment using the equity method.

Provision for Income Taxes

In 2006, the Company’s effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and the year was 37.7% and 38.5%, respectively, compared to 28.0% and 30.4% for the same periods in
2005. The rate increase for both 2006 periods was primarily due to a favorable one-time tax benefit of $77 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings that occurred in 2005 under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. The 2006
fourth quarter and annual effective tax rate from on going operations decreased due to the resolution of certain state tax matters. For additional information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash generated from operating activities provides the primary resources to support current operations,
growth initiatives, seasonal funding requirements and capital expenditures. In addition, the Company has funds available from an unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) as well as a commercial paper program which is backed by
the Facility. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company issued commercial paper under the Facility for the short-term funding of the Company’s peak working capital needs. The average balance during the quarter was $99 million. The Company
repaid the commercial paper within the fourth quarter. In conjunction with the acquisition of La Senza, the Company entered into a $400 million bridge facility (the “Bridge Facility”) which expires January 2008. The Company did not draw on
the Bridge Facility during the year ended February 3, 2007



or during the period from February 3, 2007 through March 23, 2007. The Company financed the acquisition of La Senza with cash on-hand as of the
January 12, 2007 acquisition date.

In addition to the facilities described above, the Company has available a shelf registration statement under
which up to $1 billion of debt securities, common and preferred stock and other securities may be issued. As of March 23, 2007, no securities have been issued under this registration statement.

The Company’s operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: Spring (the first and second quarters) and Fall (the third and fourth
quarters). The fourth quarter, including the holiday period, accounted for approximately one–third of net sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Accordingly, cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as the Company’s inventory builds in
anticipation of the holiday period. The holiday period then generates a substantial portion of the Company’s operating cash flow for the year.

A
summary of the Company’s working capital position and capitalization as of February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006, and January 29, 2005 was as follows:

The Company considers the following to be relevant measures of liquidity and capital resources:

Operating Activities

In 2006, the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities compared to 2005 was driven primarily by an increase in inventories. The Company deliberately increased inventory levels during the year to meet the following objectives: 1)
at Victoria’s Secret, increases related to new product launches in core lingerie and beauty, initiatives to increase market share and build brand loyalty and an initiative to improve in-stock inventory positions; 2) at Bath & Body
Works, increases related primarily to investments in safety stocks of seasonless basics in anticipation of the supply chain system conversion that occurred mid-year as well as an initiative to improve in-stock inventory positions.

In 2005, the increase in net cash provided by operating activities compared to 2004 was primarily driven by an increase in net income (excluding the non-cash 2004 gains
related to New York & Company and Galyan’s Trading Company, Inc.) and changes in working capital.



Investing Activities

In 2006, investing activities primarily included $548 million in capital expenditures (see “Capital Expenditures” section) and $572 million related to the acquisition of La Senza.

In 2005, investing activities primarily included $480 million in capital expenditures (see “Capital Expenditures” section), $22 million related to strategic
investments in several personal care companies and $4 million related to non-operating real estate investments.

Financing Activities

In 2006, the Company had the following financing activities: (i) cash payments of $193 million related to the repurchase of 8 million shares of common stock
during the year at a weighted-average price of $24.98 under the Company’s November 2005, February 2006 and June 2006 share repurchase programs, (ii) quarterly dividend payments of $0.15 per share, or $238 million and
(iii) repayment of long-term debt of $7 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $153 million and excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $46 million.

In 2005, the Company had the following financing activities: (i) cash payments of $380 million related to the repurchase of 17 million shares of common stock
during the year at a weighted-average price of $22.49 under the Company’s February, May, August and November 2005 share repurchase programs and (ii) quarterly dividend payments of $0.15 per share, or $242 million. These uses of cash were
partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $64 million and a $30 million draw on a line of credit at Mast (see discussion below).

The Company has available a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Facility”), none of which was used as of February 3, 2007. The Facility is available to support the Company’s commercial paper and letter
of credit programs, which may be used from time to time to fund working capital and other general corporate requirements. Borrowings outstanding under the Facility, if any, are due in March 2011. Fees payable under the Facility are based on the
Company’s long-term credit ratings, and, at February 3, 2007, were 0.10% of the committed amount per year. The Facility also requires the Company to maintain certain specified fixed charge and debt-to-earnings ratios and prohibits certain
types of liens on property or assets. The Company was in compliance with the covenant requirements as of February 3, 2007.

In connection with the
acquisition of La Senza and expanding internationally, the Company entered into a $400 million bridge facility (the “Bridge Facility”) in January 2007. Borrowings under the Bridge Facility, if any, are due in January 2008. There were no
borrowings outstanding as of February 3, 2007. Fees payable under the Bridge Facility are based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings, and are currently 0.10% of the committed amount per year. Interest on borrowings from the Bridge
Facility is calculated at LIBOR plus a credit spread.

In January 2006, Mast Industries (Far East) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Limited Brands,
Inc., entered into a $60 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Mast Credit Facility”). During 2006, $30 million was drawn on the facility while the remaining $30 million expired in March 2006. The credit facility is available
for general corporate purposes including the funding of dividends to Limited Brands, Inc. The interest rate is 5.84% including annual fees payable under the facility of 0.05% on the outstanding principal amounts which totaled $23 million as of
February 3, 2007. Borrowings under this facility are due in equal semi-annual installments through the maturity date of the facility in January 2010.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures totaled $548 million, $480 million and $431 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In each
of the years, $311 million, $298 million and $381 million were for new stores and for the remodeling of



and improvements to existing stores. Remaining capital expenditures were primarily related to investments in new growth concepts and increased spending on
technology and infrastructure to support growth.

The Company anticipates spending approximately $790 to $815 million for capital expenditures in 2007, the
majority of which relates to the remodeling of and improvements to existing stores and opening new stores. The Company expects to open about 125 new store locations and to close about 143 store locations. Our new stores will be primarily
Victoria’s Secret and BBW, while we will primarily be closing unproductive Express stores. Additional spending will relate to new financial and operational systems and investments in the Company’s Direct businesses, including technology
and a new distribution center and additional home office spending driven primarily by consolidating the majority of our New York offices to one location. The Company expects that 2007 capital expenditures will be funded principally by net cash
provided by operating activities.

Easton Investment

The Company has land and other investments in Easton, a 1,300 acre planned community in Columbus, Ohio, that integrates office, hotel, retail, residential and recreational space. These investments, at cost, totaled $59 million at
February 3, 2007 and $65 million at January 28, 2006.

Included in the Company’s Easton investments is an equity interest in Easton Town
Center, LLC (“ETC”), an entity that owns and has developed a commercial entertainment and shopping center. The Company’s investment in ETC, which the Company accounts for using the equity method, was $4 million at February 3,
2007 and $10 million at January 28, 2006. The Company has a majority financial interest in ETC, but another member that is unaffiliated with the Company is the managing member. Certain significant decisions regarding ETC require the consent of
the unaffiliated members in addition to the Company.

Total assets of ETC were approximately $240 million as of February 3, 2007 and
$244 million as of January 28, 2006. ETC’s principal funding source is a $290 million secured bank loan, of which $221 million was outstanding at February 3, 2007. The loan is payable in full on May 31, 2010, with
the option of two 12–month extensions if certain requirements are met.

Contingent Liabilities and Contractual Obligations

In connection with the disposition of certain businesses, the Company has remaining guarantees of approximately $195 million related to lease payments of
Abercrombie & Fitch, Tween Brands Inc. (formerly Limited Too and Too, Inc.), Dick’s Sporting Goods (formerly Galyan’s), Lane Bryant and New York & Company under the current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at
various dates through 2015 (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). These guarantees include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain
other expenses, and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of the businesses. In certain instances, the Company’s guarantee may remain in effect if the term of a lease is extended. The Company believes the likelihood of
material liability being triggered under these guarantees is remote.



The following table includes aggregated information about the Company’s contractual obligations. These contractual
obligations impact the Company’s short and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. The table includes information about payments due under specified contractual obligations, aggregated by type of contractual obligation, including the
maturity profile of the Company’s long-term debt, operating leases and other long-term liabilities as of February 3, 2007.

(1)

Long-term debt obligations relate to principal and interest payments for the Company’s outstanding notes, debentures and Term Loan and line of credit borrowings (see Note 11 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). Interest payments have been estimated based on the coupon rate for fixed rate obligations or the variable rate in effect at February 3, 2007 for
the Term Loan and the Mast Credit Facility. Interest obligations exclude amounts which have been accrued through February 3, 2007.

(2)

Operating lease obligations primarily relate to minimum payments due under store lease agreements (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data).

(3)

Purchase obligations primarily include purchase orders for merchandise inventory and other agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that
specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.

(4)

Other liabilities primarily include future payments relating to the Company’s nonqualified supplemental retirement plan and have been reflected under “Other” as the
timing of these future payments is not known until an associate leaves the Company or otherwise requests an in-service distribution (see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Other
than those disclosed, the Company has no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation 229.303 Item 303 (a) (4).

Recently Issued
Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the recognition threshold and measurement principles for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2006. The Company will adopt FIN 48 in the first quarter of 2007. The Company is finalizing its evaluation of this interpretation but expects to record a decrease of up to $12 million to retained earnings upon adoption.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and
liabilities and only applies when other standards require or permit the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities. It does not expand the use of fair value measurement.



SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Adoption of SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Impact of Inflation

The Company’s results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of
inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, the Company believes the effects of inflation, if any, on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management
evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, long-lived assets, claims and contingencies, income taxes and revenue recognition. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical
experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates
with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting its results of operations and financial position.

Inventories

Inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost
or market, on a weighted-average cost basis. The Company records valuation adjustments to its inventories if the cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount the Company expects to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the
inventory. These estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, future
period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates.

Another significant estimate related to
inventories is an adjustment for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory. This estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends.

Management does not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on prior experience. However, a 10% increase or decrease in the
inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately $2 million for the year ended February 3, 2007. A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by
approximately $2 million for the year ended February 3, 2007.

Valuation of Long-lived Assets

Property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
asset may not be recoverable. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, usually determined by
the discounted future cash flows of the asset. Factors used in the valuation include, but are not limited to, management’s plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results and projected cash flows. When a decision has
been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life.



Intangible assets not subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment annually by comparing the fair value to the
carrying value. Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment by comparing each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. Factors used in the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill include, but are not limited to, management’s
plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results and projected cash flows. If future economic conditions are different than those projected by management, impairment charges may be required.

Claims and Contingencies

The Company is subject to various claims
and contingencies related to lawsuits, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. The Company’s determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements is
based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency. The Company consults with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seeks input from both internal and external experts within and outside the
Company with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible
(as opposed to probable), or if an estimate is not determinable, disclosure of a material claim or contingency is made in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals,
deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, the Company’s tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and
foreign tax authorities. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

While the Company’s recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment, revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy of the Company. The Company recognizes revenue upon customer receipt
of the merchandise. For e-commerce and catalogue revenues, the Company estimates shipments that have not been received by the customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times. The Company also provides a reserve for projected
merchandise returns based on prior experience.

All of the Company’s brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates. The Company recognizes income
from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer. In addition, the Company recognizes income on unredeemed gift cards when it can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and that there is no legal obligation to
remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions (gift card breakage). The Company determines the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company accumulated enough historical
data to determine the gift card breakage rate at both Express and Bath & Body Works. Once the breakage rate is determined, it is recognized over a 36-month period based on historical redemption patterns of each brand’s gift cards. Gift
card breakage is included in net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recognized $30 million in
pretax income related to the initial recognition of gift card breakage at Express and Bath & Body Works. The Company will recognize gift card breakage at our other businesses when adequate historical data exists.



ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Market Risk

The market risk inherent in the Company’s financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in
foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates.

The Company’s foreign exchange rate exposure is primarily the result of the January 2007
acquisition of La Senza Corporation, whose operations are conducted primarily in Canada. To mitigate the exposure to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange rate, the Company entered into a series of cross-currency swaps related to
Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans. These cross-currency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate Canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate U.S. dollar interest payments as well as exchange of Canadian dollar and U.S.
dollar principal payments upon maturity. The swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same time as the related loans.

The Company uses
derivative financial instruments like the cross-currency swaps to manage exposure to foreign exchange rates. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Management believes the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with financial instruments (such as investments and borrowings) is not material.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying
value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value because of their short maturity. The fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar
issues. The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt was $1.6 billion compared to the carrying value of $1.7 billion at both February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006. The aggregate fair value of foreign currency swap arrangements was
$3 million at February 3, 2007.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions, as well as corporate commercial paper. The Company monitors the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and
other entities and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. The Company also monitors the creditworthiness of the entities to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the
Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2007. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).

Based on our assessment
and the COSO criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2007.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Ernst &
Young LLP’s report appears on the following page and expresses unqualified opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2007.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

To the Board of Directors
and Shareholders of Limited Brands, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting, that Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Limited Brands, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of February 3, 2007, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income,
Shareholders’ Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 3, 2007 of Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries, and our report dated March 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial Statements

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of

Limited Brands, Inc.:

We have audited the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Shareholders’ Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the
three years in the period ended February 3, 2007. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Limited
Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 3, 2007, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2005 the Company changed its method of
accounting for inventories. Also, as discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006 the Company changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Limited Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial
reporting as of February 3, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 28, 2007 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. Fiscal years are designated in the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes by the calendar year in which the fiscal year commences.
The results for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 represent the fifty–three week period ended February 3, 2007 and the fifty-two week periods ended January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on
hand, demand deposits with financial institutions and highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than 90 days. Accounts payable includes $110 million and $154 million of outstanding checks at February 3, 2007 and
January 28, 2006, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost, as determined by the weighted-average cost method, or market. Prior to 2005, inventories were principally valued at the lower of cost, as determined by the weighted-average retail
inventory method, or market (see Note 2).

Store Supplies

The initial shipment of selling–related supplies (primarily hangers, signage and security tags) is capitalized on the store opening date. Subsequent shipments are expensed. Store supplies are adjusted as appropriate for changes in
actual quantities or costs. Store supplies are included in other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Direct Response
Advertising

The Company capitalizes the direct costs of producing and distributing its catalogues and amortizes the costs over the expected future
revenue stream, which is generally three months from the date catalogues are mailed.



Capitalized direct response advertising costs of $34 million at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006 are included in other current assets in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. All other advertising costs are expensed at the time the promotion first appears in media or in the store. Catalogue and advertising costs amounted to $603 million in 2006, $517 million in 2005 and $492
million in 2004.

Property and Equipment

Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is computed on a straight–line basis, using the following useful lives:

When a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated
useful life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life. The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any resulting
gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and betterments that extend useful lives are capitalized.

Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the undiscounted future cash flows related to
the property and equipment are less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value, usually determined through discounted cash flows analysis. Factors used in the
valuation of property and equipment include, but are not limited to, management’s plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results and projected future cash flows.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company has certain intangible
assets resulting from business acquisitions that are recorded at cost. Intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives, ranging from 4 to 20 years, and are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment at least annually by comparing the
carrying value to the estimated fair value.

Goodwill, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired, is not
subject to periodic amortization. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment by comparing each reporting unit’s
carrying value to its estimated fair value.

Factors used in the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill include, but are not limited to,
management’s plans for future operations, brand initiatives, recent operating results and projected cash flows.

Leases and Leasehold Improvements

For leases that contain predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rentals and/or rent abatements subsequent to taking possession of the leased
property, the Company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight–line basis and records the difference between the recognized rental expense and amounts payable under the leases as deferred lease credits, which are included in other
long–term liabilities. The liability for predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rentals and/or rent abatements amounted to $98 million and $94 million at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively.



Landlord allowances received upon entering into certain store leases are recorded as a long–term deferred credit and
are amortized on a straight–line basis as a reduction to rent expense over the lease term. The unamortized portion of landlord allowances is included in other long–term liabilities and amounted to $185 million and $170 million at
February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively.

During 2004, the Company, in consultation with its independent auditors, concluded that its
previous accounting practices related to the accounting for straight-line rent and the depreciation and amortization of leasehold improvements and certain landlord allowances were not correct. Accordingly in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company
recorded a one-time pretax charge of $61 million, which is included in cost of goods sold, buying and occupancy in the Consolidated Statement of Income, to reflect the corrections more fully described below.

Historically, the Company recognized straight-line rent expense for leases beginning on the earlier of the store opening date or lease commencement date, resulting in
the exclusion of the store build-out period (“Rent Holiday”) from the period over which it amortized its rent expense. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company adjusted its straight-line rent accrual for all applicable leases to reflect
the recognition of rent expense over a period that includes the Rent Holiday period, resulting in cumulative additional rent expense of $31 million.

In
addition, the Company had previously depreciated leasehold improvements over a period of up to 10 years, which, primarily due to store remodeling activity, resulted in certain leasehold improvements being depreciated over a period beyond the
contractual lease term. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company adjusted the net book value of its leasehold improvements to reflect useful lives equal to the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets, or the contractual term of the
lease, resulting in cumulative additional depreciation expense of $39 million. In addition, the Company had previously amortized certain landlord allowances beyond the contractual lease term. The Company adjusted these landlord allowances to reflect
amortization over the contractual term of the lease, resulting in a cumulative reduction in rent expense of $9 million.

The Company evaluated the impact
of these revised accounting practices from a quantitative and qualitative perspective. From a quantitative perspective, had the revised accounting practices been applied retroactively, reported pretax income from continuing operations would
have increased by $7 million in 2004. Additionally, these corrections do not impact the Company’s historical or future cash flows or the timing of lease related payments. From a qualitative perspective, the retroactive application of
these revised accounting practices would not have had a significant impact on earnings trends, individual segment results, earnings expectations or debt covenants or other contractual requirements. Based on this evaluation, the Company
concluded that a restatement of prior period results was not required as the impact of these corrections was not material to the Company’s historical results or cash flows.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of the Company’s foreign operations is the applicable
local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. The resulting
translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders’ equity.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange rates. The Company does not use
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS No. 133”)
as amended, which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value.



The Company’s foreign exchange rate exposure is primarily the result of the January 2007 acquisition of La Senza
Corporation (see Note 3), whose operations are conducted primarily in Canada. To mitigate the exposure to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange rate, the Company entered into a series of cross-currency swaps related to Canadian
dollar denominated intercompany loans. These cross-currency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate Canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate U.S. dollar interest payments as well as exchange of Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar
principal payments upon maturity. The swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same time as the related loans.

The cross-currency interest
rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency exchange risk. Changes in the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange rate result in reclassification of amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings to offset
foreign currency transaction gains and losses recognized on the intercompany loans. The aggregate fair value of foreign currency swap arrangements was $3 million at February 3, 2007 and is included in other long-term liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Income Taxes

The Company
accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Self Insurance

The Company is self–insured for medical, worker’s compensation, general liability and automobile benefits up to certain stop–loss limits. Such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of
incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. IBNR claims are estimated using historical claim information and actuarial estimates.

Minority
Interest

Minority interest on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets represents the portion of equity interests of consolidated affiliates not
owned by the Company.

Revenue Recognition

The Company
recognizes sales upon customer receipt of the merchandise, which for e–commerce and catalogue revenues reflects an estimate of shipments that have not yet been received by the customer based on shipping terms and estimated delivery times.
Shipping and handling revenues are included in net sales and the related costs are included in costs of goods sold, buying and occupancy. The Company also provides a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience. Net sales
excludes sales tax collected from customers.

The Company’s brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates. The Company recognizes income from gift
cards when they are redeemed by the customer. In addition, the Company recognizes income on unredeemed gift cards when it can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and that there is no legal obligation to remit the
unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions (gift card breakage). The Company determines the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company accumulated enough historical data to
determine the gift card breakage rate at both Express and Bath & Body Works. Once the breakage rate is determined, breakage is recognized over a 36 month period based on historical redemption patterns of each brand’s gift cards. Gift
card breakage is included in net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recognized $30 million in
pretax income related to the initial recognition of gift card breakage at Express and Bath & Body Works. The Company will recognize gift card breakage at Victoria’s Secret and Limited Stores when adequate historical data exists.



Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy

Costs of goods sold includes merchandise costs, net of discounts and allowances, freight and inventory shrinkage. Buying and occupancy expenses primarily include payroll, benefit costs and operating expenses for the
Company’s buying departments and distribution network, rent, common area maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance, catalogue amortization and depreciation for the Company’s stores, warehouse facilities and equipment.

General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses

General, administrative and store operating expenses primarily include payroll and benefit costs for the Company’s store–selling and administrative departments (including corporate functions), marketing, advertising and other
operating expenses not specifically categorized elsewhere in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Gain on Sale of Investees’ Stock

During the second quarter of 2004, the Company sold its remaining ownership interest in Galyan’s Trading Company, Inc. (“Galyan’s”)
for $65 million resulting in a pretax gain of $18 million. Prior to the sale of Galyan’s shares, the Company accounted for its investment using the equity method.

Earnings Per Share

Earnings per basic share is computed based on the weighted-average number of outstanding common
shares. Earnings per diluted share includes the weighted-average effect of dilutive options and restricted stock on the weighted-average shares outstanding.

Shares utilized for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ending February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 were as follows:

The computation of earnings per diluted share excludes options to purchase approximately 6 million,
6 million and 1 million shares of common stock in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, because the impact of such options would have been antidilutive.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) consists of gains and losses on derivative instruments, unrealized gains and losses
on available-for-sale investments, and foreign currency translation adjustments. The cumulative gains and losses on derivative instruments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, and foreign currency translation adjustments
are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity.



The following table gives additional detail regarding the composition of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at
February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006:

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the
recognition threshold and measurement principles for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company will adopt FIN 48 in the first quarter of 2007. The Company is finalizing its
evaluation of this interpretation but expects to record a decrease of up to $12 million to retained earnings upon adoption.

In September 2006, the FASB
issued FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”), which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and only applies when other standards require or permit the fair value
measurement of assets and liabilities. It does not expand the use of fair value measurement. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Adoption of SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates and the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.

2. Changes in Accounting Principle

During 2006, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”). See Note 13 for additional information.

During 2005, the Company changed its inventory valuation method. Previously, inventories were principally valued at the lower of cost or market, on a weighted-average cost basis, using the retail method. Commencing in
2005, inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or market, on a weighted-average cost basis, using the cost method. The Company believes the cost method is preferable as compared to the retail method because it will increase the
organizational focus on the actual margin realized on each sale. Additionally, it is consistent with the practices of many other retailers as well as the Company’s personal care and beauty competitors.

The cumulative effect of this change was $17 million, net of tax of $11 million. This change was recognized as an increase to net income in the Consolidated Statement of
Income as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2005. In addition to the $17 million cumulative impact recognized as of the beginning of the first quarter, the effect of the change during 2005 was to decrease net income by $4 million, or $0.01
per diluted share. The reported results for periods prior to fiscal 2005 have not been restated.



The fiscal 2004 pro forma Consolidated Statement of Income is presented below as adjusted for the effect of the
retroactive application of the cost method, net of related taxes, as if the new method had been in effect for that entire fiscal year.

3. Acquisition of La Senza Corporation

On January 12, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the stock of La Senza Corporation (“La Senza”) for $600 million, including transaction costs of $8 million. The acquisition was
financed through the use of existing cash and was accounted for as a purchase, with results of operations included in the Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of acquisition. La Senza is a Canadian specialty retailer offering lingerie
and sleepwear as well as apparel for girls in the 7-14 year age group. In addition, independently owned La Senza stores operate in 34 other countries under license arrangements. The acquisition of La Senza supports our objective of enhancing our
capabilities to pursue our strategic growth goals internationally.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:



4. Sale of New York & Company

On November 27, 2002, the Company sold one of its Apparel businesses, New York & Company, to an investor group led by the business unit’s President and Chief Executive Officer and affiliates of Bear
Stearns Merchant Banking. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received $79 million in cash, a $75 million 10% subordinated note due November 2009 (the “New York & Company Note”) and warrants for approximately 13% of the
common equity of the new company (the “New York & Company Warrants”). A $26 million discount was recorded on the New York & Company Note, which was being accreted to income over the term of the note.

During the first quarter of 2004, the Company recognized a $45 million gain resulting from New York & Company’s early repayment of the New York &
Company Note and purchase of the New York & Company Warrants. The note and warrants had a carrying value, including accrued interest, of $60 million.

In connection with the agreement to prepay the note and purchase the warrants, as amended on August 5, 2004, New York & Company agreed to make an additional payment to Limited Brands if (i) New York & Company
completed an initial public offering pursuant to a registration statement filed on or before December 31, 2004 or was sold pursuant to an agreement entered into on or before December 31, 2004 and (ii) the implied equity value of New
York & Company based upon one of the above transactions exceeded $157 million. During the third quarter of 2004, New York & Company completed an initial public offering and the Company received the agreed upon payment of $45
million, at which time the Company recognized a $45 million pretax, non-operating gain.

The Company will continue to provide certain corporate services to
New York & Company under service agreements which expire at various dates through 2009.

5. Property and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment, net at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006 were as follows:

6. Goodwill, Trade Names and Other Intangible Assets, Net

The following is a rollforward of goodwill for the fiscal years ended February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006:



In conjunction with the January 2007 acquisition of La Senza, the Company recorded $313 million in goodwill, which is not
deductible for tax purposes, $170 million in intangible assets, not subject to amortization, and $26 million related to intangible assets, subject to amortization. The intangible assets, not subject to amortization, consist of indefinite lived trade
names. The intangible assets, subject to amortization, consist primarily of international licensing arrangements and favorable store operating lease agreements. These intangible assets have an estimated weighted-average amortization period of 13
years.

An additional $29 million of goodwill was recorded as a result of the Company’s acquisitions of several personal care businesses in 2006 and
2005.

The remaining balance of intangible assets, not subject to amortization, represents trade names that were recorded in connection with the
acquisition of the Intimate Brands, Inc. (“IBI”) minority interest and totaled $411 million as of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006.

Intangible assets, subject to amortization, were as follows:

Amortization expense was $11 million in 2006, $11 million in 2005 and $8 million in 2004. Estimated future annual
amortization expense will be approximately $12 million in 2007, $7 million in 2008, $6 million in 2009, 2010, and 2011 and $26 million thereafter.

7.
Easton Investment

The Company has land and other investments in Easton, a 1,300 acre planned community in Columbus, Ohio that integrates office, hotel,
retail, residential and recreational space. These investments, at cost, totaled $59 million at February 3, 2007 and $65 million at January 28, 2006 and are recorded in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Included in the Company’s Easton investments is an equity interest in Easton Town Center, LLC (“ETC”), an entity that owns and has developed a commercial
entertainment and shopping center. The Company’s investment in ETC, which totaled $4 million at February 3, 2007 and $10 million at January 28, 2006, is accounted for using the equity method. The Company has a majority financial
interest in ETC, but another member that is unaffiliated with the Company is the managing member. Certain significant decisions regarding ETC require the consent of the unaffiliated members in addition to the Company.

Total assets of ETC were approximately $240 million as of February 3, 2007 and $244 million as of January 28, 2006. ETC’s principal funding
source is a $290 million secured bank loan, of which $221 million was outstanding at February 3, 2007. The loan is payable in full on May 31, 2010, with the option of two 12-month extensions if certain requirements are
met.



8. Leased Facilities, Commitments and Contingencies

Annual store rent consists of a fixed minimum amount and/or contingent rent based on a percentage of sales exceeding a stipulated amount.

Rent expense for the years ended February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006, and January 29, 2005 was as follows:

In 2004, fixed minimum store rent expense includes a $22 million pretax non-cash charge to correct the
Company’s accounting for leases (see Note 1).

At February 3, 2007, the Company was committed to noncancelable leases with remaining terms
generally from one to ten years. A substantial portion of these commitments consists of store leases generally with an initial term of ten years. Store lease terms generally require additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain
other expenses. The obligations for these additional payments are excluded from the table that follows.

The
Company’s minimum rent commitments under noncancelable operating leases are as follows:

At February 3, 2007, the Company’s future sublease income under noncancelable subleases was $22 million,
which included $5 million of rent commitments related to disposed businesses under master lease arrangements.

In connection with the disposition of
certain businesses, the Company has remaining guarantees of approximately $195 million related to lease payments of Abercrombie & Fitch, Tween Brands (formerly Limited Too and Too, Inc.), Dick’s Sporting Goods (formerly Galyan’s),
Lane Bryant and New York & Company under the current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through 2015. These guarantees include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other
expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of the businesses. In certain instances, the Company’s guarantee may remain in effect if the term of a lease is extended. The Company believes the likelihood of material
liabilities being triggered under these guarantees, with respect to existing and extended leases, is remote.

The Company is subject to various claims and
contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. Management believes that the ultimate liability arising from such claims and contingencies, if any, is not likely to have
a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.



During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company received $8.5 million from a favorable litigation settlement with respect
to merchant fees previously paid to Visa and MasterCard. The settlement was recognized in 2005 as a reduction to general, administrative and store operating expenses.

9. Accrued Expenses and Other

Accrued expenses and other at February 3, 2007
and January 28, 2006 were as follows:

10. Income Taxes

The components of the Company’s provision for income taxes for the years ended February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006, and January 29, 2005 were as follows:

The foreign component of pretax income, arising principally from overseas operations, was $54 million in 2006, $56
million in 2005 and $46 million in 2004.

The reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax rate and the effective tax rate for the years ended
February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 was as follows:



The Company’s effective tax rate has historically reflected and continues to reflect a provision related to the
undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates. The Company has recorded a deferred tax liability for those amounts, but the taxes are not paid until the earnings are deemed repatriated to the United States.

The timing of when earnings are repatriated was a matter of dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). The Company successfully litigated the matter
related to the 1992 to 1994 years. For the 1995 to 2002 years, the Company and the IRS negotiated a settlement that determined that a portion of the foreign earnings had been repatriated. This settlement was approved in December 2005, resulting in a
tax refund of $63 million, which was recorded as an increase to deferred tax liabilities, and an interest refund of $40 million, which was reflected in interest income and accounts receivable in the Company’s 2005 financial statements and was
collected in 2006.

In January 2006, the Company approved a qualifying reinvestment plan and repatriated $395 million of untaxed foreign earnings pursuant
to the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. This repatriation resulted in a one-time tax benefit of $77 million in the fourth quarter of 2005.

The effect of temporary differences that give rise to deferred income taxes at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006 was as follows:

The table above reflects the establishment of deferred assets and liabilities related to the January 2007
acquisition of La Senza.

As of February 3, 2007, the Company had available for state income tax purposes net operating loss carryforwards which
expire, if unused, in the years 2007 through 2026. The Company has determined that it is more likely than not that substantially all of the state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized and, accordingly, a valuation allowance has been
provided for the deferred tax asset.

Income taxes payable included net current deferred tax liabilities of $40 million at February 3, 2007 and $39
million at January 28, 2006. Income tax payments were $451 million in 2006, $298 million in 2005 and $385 million in 2004.



11. Long-term Debt

The Company’s long-term debt balance at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006 consisted of (millions):

In connection with the acquisition of La Senza and expanding internationally, the Company entered into a $400
million bridge facility (the “Bridge Facility”) in January 2007. Borrowings under the Bridge Facility, if any, are due in January 2008. There were no borrowings outstanding as of February 3, 2007. Fees payable under the Bridge
Facility are based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings, and are currently 0.10% of the committed amount per year. Interest on borrowings from the Bridge Facility is calculated at LIBOR plus a credit spread.

In January 2006, Mast Industries (Far East) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Limited Brands, Inc., entered into a $60 million unsecured revolving credit facility.
During 2006, $30 million was drawn on the facility while the remaining $30 million expired in March 2006. The credit facility is available for general corporate purposes including the funding of dividends to Limited Brands, Inc. Borrowings under the
credit facility are due in equal semi-annual installments through the maturity date of the credit facility in January 2010.

In October 2004, the Company
issued $500 million of 5.25% notes due November 2014 utilizing a shelf registration statement. The Company also borrowed $500 million under a term loan agreement (the “Term Loan”) that became effective in November 2004. The proceeds of
these borrowings were used to partially finance the Company’s $2 billion tender offer and $500 million special dividend during the fourth quarter of 2004. The principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan is due in 2011.

In conjunction with the completion of the $2 billion tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company replaced its existing unsecured revolving credit facility
with a new $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Facility”). The Facility is available to support the Company’s commercial paper and letter of credit programs, which may be used from time to time to fund working capital
and other general corporate requirements. Borrowings outstanding under the Facility, if any, are due in March 2011. There were no borrowings outstanding as of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006. Fees payable under the Facility are based
on the Company’s long-term credit ratings, and are currently 0.10% of the committed amount per year.

The Facility and the Term Loan have several
interest rate options, which are based in part on the Company’s long-term credit ratings. These agreements also require the Company to maintain certain specified fixed charge and debt-to-earnings ratios and prohibit certain types of liens on
property or assets. The Company was in compliance with the covenant requirements as of February 3, 2007.



Principal payments due on long-term debt in the next five fiscal years and the remaining years thereafter are as follows:

Cash paid for interest was $100 million in 2006, $96 million in 2005 and $46 million in 2004.

12. Shareholders’ Equity

Under the authority of the
Company’s Board of Directors, the Company repurchased shares of its common stock under the following repurchase programs during the fiscal years ending February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005:

(a)

The repurchase program authorized in June 2006 included $59 million remaining as of February 3, 2007.

(b)

The repurchase program authorized in November 2005 had repurchases of $42 million in 2006 at an average stock price of $23.40 and repurchases of $158 million in 2005 at an average
stock price of $22.67. This program was completed in February 2006.

(c)

The repurchase program authorized in October 2004 superseded the August 2004 program. Repurchases were made under a modified Dutch Auction tender offer. Upon completion of this
tender offer, the Board of Directors declared a $500 million special dividend, or $1.23 per share, which was paid in January 2005.

(d)

Repurchases authorized in February 2004 were made under a modified Dutch Auction tender offer.

In connection with the June 2006 repurchase program, $0.3 million of share repurchases were reflected in accounts payable at February 3, 2007. The balance was settled in February 2007.

13. Share-Based Compensation

Plan Summary

The 1993 Stock Option and Performance Incentive Plan as amended (the “Plan”), which is shareholder approved, provides for the grant of incentive stock options,
non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted



stock, performance-based restricted stock, performance units and unrestricted shares. The Company grants stock options at the fair market value of the stock
on the date of grant. Stock options have a maximum term of ten years. Stock options generally vest over 4 years with 25% vesting each year.

Restricted
stock generally vests (the restrictions lapse) over a two to six year period. The Limited Brands, Inc. Stock Award and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Associate Directors provides for an annual stock retainer for non-associate directors. The
stock issued in conjunction with this plan has no restrictions. Under the Company’s plans, approximately 100 million options, restricted and unrestricted shares have been authorized to be granted to employees and directors. Approximately
21 million options and restricted shares were available for grant at February 3, 2007.

In anticipation of SFAS 123(R), the Company did not
modify the Plan or terms of any previously granted options. During 2006, the Company issued performance-based restricted stock awards. The fair value of these shares is measured on the date that the performance goals and the target number of shares
are communicated. The final number of shares of performance-based restricted stock issued to each employee is determined at the end of each Spring and Fall selling seasons, based upon performance against specified financial goals. The vesting period
of these awards ranges from two to three years.

In connection with the $500 million special dividend in 2004, the Company adjusted both the exercise price
and the number of stock-based awards outstanding as of the record date of the special dividend. As a result of this adjustment, both the aggregate intrinsic value and the ratio of the exercise price to the market price were approximately equal
immediately before and after the dividend record date. As a result, no compensation expense was recognized for this adjustment.

The Company has a policy of issuing treasury shares to satisfy award exercises or conversions.

Stock Option Activity

The Company’s stock option activity for the year ended February 3, 2007 was as follows:

(a)

The number of options expected to vest takes into account an estimate of expected forfeitures.

Intrinsic value for stock options is the difference between the current market value of the Company’s stock and the option strike price. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended
February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 was $130 million, $43 million and $110 million, respectively.

The total fair
value at grant date of option awards vested during the year ended February 3, 2007 was $39 million.

As of February 3, 2007, there was $34
million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested options. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.



Cash received from stock options exercised for the years ended February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006 and
January 29, 2005 was $153 million, $64 million and $182 million, respectively. Tax benefits realized from tax deductions associated with stock options exercised for the years ended February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006 and
January 29, 2005 were $50 million, $15 million and $44 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Activity

The Company’s restricted stock activity for the year ended February 3, 2007 was as follows:

The total intrinsic value of restricted stock vested during the year ended February 3,
2007, January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 was $14 million, $11 million and $13 million, respectively.

The total fair value at grant date
of awards vested during the year ended February 3, 2007 was $10 million.

As of February 3, 2007, there was $32 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested restricted stock. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.

Tax benefits realized from tax deductions associated with restricted stock vested for the years ended February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 were $4 million, $4 million and $5
million, respectively.

Background on Change in Accounting Principle

On January 29, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123(R), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair
values on the grant date. SFAS 123(R) supersedes the Company’s previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”) for periods beginning in fiscal
2006. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB 107”) relating to SFAS 123(R). The Company has applied the provisions of SAB 107 in its adoption of SFAS 123(R).

SFAS 123(R) requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant and recognize as expense the value of the portion of
the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the requisite service period. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company accounted for share-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB
25. Under the intrinsic value method, no stock-based compensation expense was recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income, other than for restricted stock, because the exercise price of the Company’s stock options granted
to employees and directors was equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant.

The Company adopted SFAS 123(R) using the
modified prospective transition method, which requires the application of the accounting standard as of January 29, 2006, the first day of the Company’s fiscal year 2006. The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year
ended February 3, 2007 reflect the impact of



SFAS 123(R). In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods have not
been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS 123(R).

Under the modified prospective transition method, share-based compensation
expense recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income for the period ended February 3, 2007 includes compensation expense for:

•

Share-based awards granted and unvested prior to January 29, 2006, based on the grant date fair value determined in accordance with the pro forma provisions of
SFAS 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS No. 123”).

•

Share-based awards granted subsequent to January 29, 2006, based on the grant date fair value determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R).

Valuation and Attribution Methodology

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (“Black-Scholes model”) for valuation of options granted to employees and directors. The Company’s determination of the fair value of options is affected by the
Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and
projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.

The weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during the year ended
February 3, 2007 was $7.61 per share and during the years ended January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 (for pro forma purposes) was $7.54 and $6.25, respectively, based on the following weighted-average assumptions:

The expected volatility assumption is based on the Company’s analysis of historical volatility. The risk-free
interest rate assumption is based upon the average daily closing rates during the period for U.S. treasury notes that have a life which approximates the expected life of the option. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s
history and expectation of dividend payouts. The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. Fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the market value
of an unrestricted share on the grant date adjusted for anticipated dividend yields.

SFAS 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant
and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. As a result, beginning in fiscal 2006, the Company began applying an estimated forfeiture rate based on historical data to determine the amount of
compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Prior to 2006, the Company used the actual forfeiture method allowed under SFAS 123 which assumed that all options would vest. Under this method, pro forma expense was only
adjusted when options were actually forfeited prior to the vesting dates.

Compensation expense for stock options is recognized, net of forfeitures, over
the requisite service period on a straight-line basis, using a single option approach (each option is valued as one grant, irrespective of the number of vesting tranches). Restricted stock expense is recognized, net of forfeitures, on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period.



Impact of Change in Accounting Principle

Total pre-tax share-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS 123(R) for the year ended February 3, 2007 was $37 million. Share-based compensation expense of $11 million and $9 million for the years ended
January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 related primarily to restricted stock which the Company also expensed under APB 25. The tax benefit associated with share-based compensation was $11 million, $4 million and $3 million the years ended
February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, respectively.

Pre-tax share-based compensation expense included in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income is as follows (millions):

Share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended
February 3, 2007 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and, accordingly, has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods
if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended February 3, 2007 of $0.7 million (net of tax of $0.4 million) relates to an
estimate of forfeitures of previously recognized unvested restricted stock awards outstanding as of January 29, 2006, the date of adoption of SFAS 123(R).

The adoption of SFAS 123(R) had the following incremental impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended February 3, 2007:

The following table is presented for comparative purposes and illustrates the pro forma effect on net income and
earnings per share for the years ended January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation prior to January 29, 2006:



14. Retirement Benefits

The Company sponsors a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan and a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan. Participation in the tax-qualified plan is available to associates who meet certain age and service requirements.
Participation in the non-qualified plan is made available to associates who meet certain age, service, job level and compensation requirements.

The
qualified plan permits associates to elect contributions up to the maximum limits allowable under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches associate contributions according to a predetermined formula and contributes additional amounts based on
a percentage of the associates’ eligible annual compensation and years of service. Associates’ contributions and Company matching contributions vest immediately. Additional Company contributions and the related investment
earnings are subject to vesting based on the associates’ years of service. Total expense recognized related to this plan was $49 million in 2006, $44 million in 2005 and $44 million in 2004.

The non-qualified plan is an unfunded plan which provides benefits beyond the Internal Revenue Code limits for qualified plans. The plan permits associates to elect
contributions up to a maximum amount. The Company matches associate contributions according to a predetermined formula and contributes additional amounts based on a percentage of the associates’ eligible compensation and years of
service. The plan also permits associates to defer additional compensation up to a maximum amount. The Company does not match the contributions for additional deferred compensation. Associates’ accounts are credited with interest
using a rate determined annually based on an evaluation of the 10-year and 30-year borrowing rates available to the Company. Associate contributions and the related interest vest immediately. Company contributions and the related interest are
subject to vesting based on the associates’ years of service. Associates may elect an in-service distribution for the additional deferred compensation component only. Associates are not permitted to take a withdrawal from any other portion
of the Plan while actively employed with the Company. The remaining vested portion of associates’ accounts can only be paid upon termination of employment in either a lump sum or in equal annual installments over a specified period of up
to 10 years. The annual activity for this plan and the Company’s year-end liability, which is included in other long-term liabilities, was as follows:

Total expense recognized related to this plan was $26 million in 2006, $20 million in 2005 and $23 million in
2004.

15. Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and accrued expenses approximates fair value because of their short maturity. The fair value of long–term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. The estimated fair value of the Company’s
long–term debt was $1.6 billion compared to the carrying value of $1.7 billion at both February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006. The aggregate fair value of foreign currency swap arrangements was $3 million at February 3, 2007.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company maintains cash and cash
equivalents with various major financial institutions, as well as corporate commercial paper. The Company monitors the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and other



entities and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. The Company also monitors the creditworthiness of the entities to which it grants
credit terms in the normal course of business.
