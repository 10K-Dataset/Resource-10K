Revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner. We continue to increase the number of locations under these types of arrangements as part of our international expansion.

Our Strengths

We believe the following competitive strengths contribute to our leading market position, differentiate us from our competitors and will drive future growth:

Industry Leading Brands

We have developed and operate brands that have come to represent an aspirational lifestyle. Our brands allow us to target markets across the economic spectrum, across demographics and across the world. We believe that our three brands, Victoria's Secret, PINK and Bath & Body Works, are highly recognizable, which provides us with a competitive advantage.

•

At Victoria’s Secret, we market glamorous and sexy product lines to our customers. While bras and panties are the core of what we do, this brand also gives our customers choices in beauty products, fragrances, sleepwear, loungewear, athletic attire and personal care accessories.

•

At PINK, we market products to the college-aged woman. While bras and panties are the core of what we do, this brand also gives our customers choices in apparel, loungewear, athletic attire and accessories.

•

Bath & Body Works caters to our customers’ entire well-being, providing shower gels and lotions, aromatherapy, home fragrance, soaps and sanitizers and body care accessories.

In-Store Experience and Store Operations

We view our customers' in-store experience as an important vehicle for communicating the image of each brand. We utilize visual presentation of merchandise, in-store marketing, music and our sales associates to reinforce the image represented by the brands.

Our in-store marketing is designed to convey the principal elements and personality of each brand. The store design, furniture, fixtures and music are all carefully planned and coordinated to create a unique shopping experience. Every brand displays merchandise uniformly to ensure a consistent store experience, regardless of location. Store managers receive detailed plans designating fixture and merchandise placement to ensure coordinated execution of the company-wide merchandising strategy.

Our sales associates and managers are a central element in creating the atmosphere of the stores by providing a high level of customer service.

Digital Experience

In addition to our in-store experience, we strive to create a customer-centric digital platform that integrates the digital and physical brand experience.  Our digital presence, including social media, our websites and our mobile applications, allows us to get to know our customers better and communicate with them anytime and anywhere.

Product Development, Sourcing and Logistics

We believe a large part of our success comes from frequent and innovative product launches, which include bra launches at Victoria’s Secret and PINK and new fragrance and other product launches at Bath & Body Works. Our merchant, design and sourcing teams have a long history of bringing innovative products to our customers. Additionally, we believe that our sourcing and production function (Mast Global) has a long and deep presence in the key sourcing markets including those in the U.S. and Asia, which helps us partner with the best manufacturers to get high-quality products quickly.

Experienced and Committed Management Team

We were founded in 1963 and have been led since inception by Leslie H. Wexner. Our senior management team has a wealth of retail and business experience at L Brands, Inc. and other companies such as The Gap, Ralph Lauren, Tory Burch, Starbucks, Land's End, Levi Strauss, Boots, The Home Depot and Yum Brands. We believe that we have one of the most experienced management teams in retail.

Additional Information

Merchandise Vendors

During


, we purchased merchandise from approximately


vendors located throughout the world. No vendor provided

10%

or more of our merchandise purchases.



Distribution and Merchandise Inventory

Most of our merchandise is shipped to our distribution centers in the Columbus, Ohio, area. We use a variety of shipping terms that result in the transfer of title of the merchandise at either the point of origin or point of destination.

Our policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventories on hand in our retail stores and distribution centers to enable us to offer customers an appropriate selection of current merchandise. We emphasize rapid turnover and take markdowns as required to keep merchandise fresh and current.

Information Systems

Our management information systems consist of a full range of retail, financial and merchandising systems. The systems include applications related to point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management, data security and support systems including human resources and finance.

Seasonal Business

Our operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: Spring (the first and second quarters) and Fall (the third and fourth quarters). The fourth quarter, including the holiday season, accounted for approximately one-third of our net sales for


,


and


and is typically our most profitable quarter. Accordingly, cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as our inventories build in advance of the holiday season.

Working Capital

We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs and investment opportunities.

Regulation

We and our products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities. We are subject to a variety of tax and customs regulations and international trade arrangements.

Trademarks and Patents

Our trademarks and patents, which constitute our primary intellectual property, have been registered or are the subject of pending applications in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law. We believe our products are identified by our intellectual property and, thus, our intellectual property is of significant value. Accordingly, we intend to maintain our intellectual property and related registrations and vigorously protect our intellectual property assets against infringement.

Segment Information

We have three reportable segments: Victoria’s Secret, Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International. For additional information, including the financial results of our reportable segments, see Note


to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item


. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Other Information

For additional information about our business, including our net sales and profits for the last three years and selling square footage, see Item


. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Competition

The sale of women's intimate and other apparel, home fragrance, personal care and beauty products and accessories through retail stores is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. Brand image, marketing, design, price, service, assortment and quality are the principal competitive factors in retail store sales. Our online businesses compete with numerous online merchandisers. Image presentation, fulfillment and the factors affecting retail store sales discussed above are the principal competitive factors in online sales.

Associate Relations

As of

February 2, 2019

, we employed approximately

88,900

associates;

63,400

of whom were part-time. In addition, temporary associates are hired during peak periods, such as the holiday season.

The following discussion of risk factors contains “forward-looking statements.” These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K, other filings or in any other discussions of our business. The following information should be read in conjunction with Item


. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation and Item


. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described below are not our only risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, operating results and/or financial condition in a material way.

Our net sales, profit results and cash flows are sensitive to, and may be affected by, general economic conditions, consumer confidence, spending patterns, weather or other market disruptions.

Our net sales, profit, cash flows and future growth may be affected by negative local, regional, national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend, including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war, terrorism or the threat thereof. In addition, market disruptions due to natural disasters, health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels. Purchases of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak. In such circumstances, we may increase the number of promotional sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The decision by the U.K. to leave the European Union (“Brexit”) has increased the uncertainty in the economic and political environment in Europe. The U.K.’s withdrawal is currently scheduled to take place in the first half of 2019, unless a further extension is agreed to; however, ongoing uncertainty remains as to what kind of post-Brexit agreement between the U.K. and the European Union, if any, may be approved by the U.K. parliament. Our business in the U.K. may be adversely impacted by this uncertainty, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, changes in trade policies, or changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws.

Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located, particularly in markets where we have multiple stores, could adversely affect our business. For example, heavy snowfall, rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability.

Our net sales, operating income, cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis.

We experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income, with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season. Any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



Seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels, since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases. We must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the holiday season selling period. If we are not successful in selling inventory, we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space.

Most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers. Sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic in those retail areas. Our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area, including “destination” retail stores, to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. Sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by factors that we cannot control, such as economic downturns or changes in consumer demographics in a particular area, consumer trends away from brick-and-mortar retail toward online shopping, competition from internet and other retailers and other retail areas where we do not have stores, the closing or decline in popularity of other stores in the shopping areas where our stores are located and the deterioration in the financial condition of the operators or developers of the shopping areas in which our stores are located.

Part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. We cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. Some of our store locations, such as our Victoria’s Secret flagship stores, require significant upfront capital investment and have material lease commitments. Additionally, we are dependent upon the suitability of the lease spaces that we currently use. The leases that we enter into are generally noncancelable leases with initial terms of 10 years. If we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a store and decide to close it, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term.

These risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions.

Our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis. Accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations. There can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our plans for international expansion include risks that could impact our results and reputation.

We intend to further expand into international markets, including mainland China, through partner arrangements and/or company-owned stores. The risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands, our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market. Any of these difficulties may lead to disruption in the overall timing of our international expansion efforts or increased costs.  Further, entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence. Other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, volatility in the geopolitical landscape, restrictions on the repatriation of funds held internationally, disruptions or delays in shipments, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, political instability and foreign governmental regulation. Such expansions will also have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance.

We also have risks related to identifying suitable partners. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales and their compliance with federal and local law. We cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets.

Further, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. See “Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations” below.

These risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



Our licensees, franchisees and wholesalers could take actions that could harm our business or brand images.

We have global representation through independently owned stores operated by our partners. Although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners, the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited, and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. For example, our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel. Our brand image and reputation may suffer materially, and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully. These risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our direct channel businesses include risks that could have an effect on our results.

Our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results. Risks include, but are not limited to, the difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through our direct channels; domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it outside our control; our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs; the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our web infrastructure, websites and the related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.

Our failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted order-taking and fulfillment operations could also have a material adverse effect on our results. The satisfaction of our online customers depends on their timely receipt of merchandise. If we encounter difficulties with the distribution facilities, or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason, including as a result of fire, natural disaster or work stoppage, we could face shortages of inventory; incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers; and cause customer dissatisfaction.

Any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our ability to protect our reputation could have a material effect on our brand images.

Our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images. Our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. Any negative publicity, including information publicized through traditional or social media platforms and similar venues such as blogs, websites and other forums, may affect our reputation and brand and, consequently, reduce demand for our merchandise, even if such publicity is unverified or inaccurate.

Failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls, to maintain the security of customer, associate, third-party or company information or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.

If our marketing, advertising and promotional programs are unsuccessful, or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are, our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected.

Customer traffic and demand for our merchandise are influenced by our advertising, marketing and promotional activities, the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of and service offered in our stores. Although we use marketing, advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media, including social media, websites, mobile applications, email, print and television, some of our competitors may expend more for their programs than we do, or use different approaches than we do, which may provide them with a competitive advantage. Our programs may not be effective or could require increased expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.

Our ability to adequately protect our trade names, trademarks and patents could have an impact on our brand images and ability to penetrate new markets.

We believe that our trade names, trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy. We have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names, trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries. There can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others. In particular, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If any third-party copies our products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation, it could have a



material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our ability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could impact our results.

The sale of women’s intimate and other apparel, personal care products and accessories is highly competitive. We compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores and discount retailers. In addition to the traditional store-based retailers, we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through online channels. Brand image, marketing, design, price, service, assortment, quality, image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the store-based and online channels.

Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available and trends across our product categories may favor our competitors. We rely to a greater degree than some of our competitors on physical locations in shopping malls and centers and so declines in traffic to such locations may affect us more significantly than our competitors. Some of our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls and centers as our stores. In addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls and centers.

Increased competition, combined with declines in mall traffic, could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of pricing power and market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our ability to manage the life cycle of our brands and to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could impact the image and relevance of our brands.

Our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively manage the life cycle of our brands and to anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate, salable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. Customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly. If we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines, our sales will be lower, potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory. In response, we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We may be impacted by our ability to adequately source, distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis.

We source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market. We distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores. Many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements, including existing or potential duties, tariffs or safeguard quotas. We compete with other companies for production facilities.

We also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis. For example:

•

political instability, significant health hazards, environmental hazards or natural disasters which could negatively affect international economies, financial markets and business activity;

•

imposition of new or retaliatory trade duties, sanctions or taxes and other charges on imports or exports;

•

evolving, new or complex legal and regulatory matters;

•

volatility in currency exchange rates;

•

local business practice and political issues (including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards) which may result in adverse publicity or threatened or actual adverse consumer actions, including boycotts;

•

potential delays or disruptions in shipping and transportation and related pricing impacts;

•

disruption due to labor disputes; and

•

changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation or other factors.

We also rely upon third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments, including shipments to and from our distribution centers, to our stores and to our customers. Our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in labor costs and fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, and associate strikes and inclement weather, which may impact our transportation providers’ ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs.



Our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We rely on a number of vendor and distribution facilities located in the same vicinity, making our business susceptible to local and regional disruptions or adverse conditions.

To achieve the necessary speed and agility in producing our beauty, personal care and home fragrance products, we rely heavily on vendor and distribution facilities in close proximity to our headquarters in Central Ohio. As a result of geographic concentration of the vendor and distribution facilities that we rely upon, our operations are susceptible to local and regional factors, such as accidents, system failures, economic and weather conditions, natural disasters, demographic and population changes, and other unforeseen events and circumstances. Any significant interruption in the operations of these facilities could lead to inventory issues or increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations.

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, our royalty arrangements are calculated based on sales in local currency and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Although we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the short-term negative impacts of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations. Hedging would generally not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign exchange rates on our business results. As a result, the fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our stock price may be volatile.

Our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry. Any guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe are reasonably attainable at the time guidance is given. If, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts or others, our stock price could be adversely affected. Investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk.

In addition, the stock market may experience price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance.

If we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.

Our dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease the level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time.  On November 19, 2018, our Board of Directors announced that it planned to reduce our annual ordinary dividend to $1.20 per share from $2.40 per share, beginning with the quarterly dividend paid in March 2019.  Any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and our stock price.

Our ability to maintain our credit rating could affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense.

The credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. A deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating. Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations. We are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. If our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest costs will likely increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, changes to our credit rating could affect our future interest costs.

We may be impacted by our ability to service or refinance our debt.

We currently have substantial indebtedness. Some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also, under certain conditions, restrict our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements. Our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of



funds for our debt service payments. If our cash flow from operations declines, we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt.

Shareholder activism could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy and impact our stock price.

Shareholder activism, which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could result in substantial costs and divert management’s and our board’s attention and resources from our business.  Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with our associates, customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel.  Also, we may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters, including for third-party advisors.  Our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism.

We may be impacted by our ability to recruit, train and retain key personnel.

We believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives, including Leslie H. Wexner, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense, and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit, train and retain other qualified key personnel.

We may be impacted by our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified associates and manage labor-related costs.

We believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive, engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer, which requires us to have highly trained and engaged associates. Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified associates, including store personnel and talented merchants. The turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high, and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas. Competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs. Our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand. Delayed store openings, significant increases in associate turnover rates or significant increases in labor-related costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We may be impacted by our vendors’ ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner, meet quality standards and comply with applicable laws and regulations.

We purchase products from third-party vendors. Factors outside our control, such as production or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns.

In addition, quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability, competition reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image.

Our business could also suffer if our third-party vendors fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations. While our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our associates visit and monitor the operations of our third-party vendors, we do not control these vendors or their practices. The violation of labor, environmental or other laws by third-party vendors used by us, or the divergence of a third-party vendor’s or partner’s labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation.

These risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our results may be affected by fluctuations in product input costs.

Product input costs, including freight, labor and raw materials, fluctuate. These fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs. We may not be able to, or may elect not to, pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



Our ability to adequately protect our assets from loss and theft.

Our assets are subject to loss, including those caused by illegal or unethical conduct by associates, customers, vendors or unaffiliated third parties. We have experienced events such as inventory shrinkage in the past, and we cannot assure that incidences of loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce these losses. Higher rates of loss or increased security costs to combat theft could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our results may be affected by fluctuations in energy costs.

Energy costs have fluctuated in the past. These fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers. A continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We may be impacted by increases in costs of mailing, paper and printing.

Postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and promotional mailings. We rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. Future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We self-insure certain risks and may be impacted by unfavorable claims experience.

We are self-insured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits, workers’ compensation, property, general liability and automobile up to certain stop-loss limits. Claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile. Any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Retained or contingent liabilities from businesses that we divest could adversely affect our financial results.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed the sale of La Senza to an affiliate of Regent LP, a global private equity firm. As a result of this divestiture, we may incur unexpected contingent liabilities, including with respect to leases assumed by the buyer. Our divestiture activities may also present financial and operational risks. Those risks may include difficulties separating personnel, financial and other systems, and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyer of La Senza. Any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data.

Our success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. Our information technology systems, as well as those of our service providers, are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunication failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security measures, some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Additionally, these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer, merchandise, financial or other important information which could result in damage to our reputation and/or litigation. The increased use of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices may also heighten these and other operational risks. Despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems. Sustained or repeated system disruptions that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores, impact our consumers’ ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information, merchandise, financial or other important information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In addition, from time to time, we make modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance. Modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including not accurately capturing data and system disruptions. Information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows.



Our ability to maintain the security of customer, associate, third-party or company information could have an impact on our reputation and our results.

Information systems are susceptible to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Any significant compromise or breach of our data security could significantly damage our reputation with our customers, associates, investors and other third parties; cause the disclosure of confidential customer, associate, third-party or company information; cause our customers to stop shopping with us; and result in significant legal, regulatory and financial liabilities and lost revenues. While we train our associates and have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to our information systems and prevent data loss, there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. In addition to our own networks and databases, we use third-party service providers to store, process and transmit certain of this information on our behalf. Although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems. We have confidential security measures in place to protect our physical facilities and information technology systems from attacks. Despite these measures, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or similar events.

The regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs, such as costs related to organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training associates and engaging consultants. Additionally, we could incur lost revenues and face increased litigation as a result of any potential cybersecurity breach.

These risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We may be impacted by our ability to comply with regulatory requirements.

We are subject to numerous regulatory requirements. Our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations, including those required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”), among others. Although we have put in place policies and procedures aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance, our associates, subcontractors, vendors, licensees, franchisees and other third parties could take actions that violate these laws and regulations. Any violations of such laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation, market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

It can be difficult to comply with sometimes conflicting regulations in local, national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations. Also, changes in such laws could make operating our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business. For example, changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs for certain merchandise, or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale. It may be difficult for us to oversee regulatory changes impacting our business, and our responses to changes in the law could be costly and may negatively impact our operations.

We may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters.

We, along with third parties we do business with, are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, tort, intellectual property, customer, employment, wage and hour, data privacy, securities, anti-corruption and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. The cost of defending against these types of claims against us or the ultimate resolution of such claims, whether by settlement or adverse court decision, may harm our business. Further, potential claimants may be encouraged to bring suits based on a settlement from us or adverse court decisions against us. We cannot currently assess the likely outcome of such suits, but if the outcome were negative, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In addition, we may be impacted by litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders, that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, the market price of our common stock, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We may be impacted by changes in taxation, trade and other regulatory requirements.

We are subject to income tax in local, national and international jurisdictions. In addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly



assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. Fluctuations in tax rates and duties, changes in tax legislation or regulation or adverse outcomes of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

There is increased uncertainty with respect to tax policy and trade relations between the U.S. and other countries. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The fiscal year ended February 3, 2018 ("2017") represents a 53-week fiscal year.

(b)

Operating income includes the effect of the following items:

(i)

In 2018, a

$99 million

loss on the sale of La Senza, an

$81 million

charge related to the impairment of certain Victoria's Secret store assets and

$20 million

of Henri Bendel closure costs.

(c)

In addition to the items previously discussed in (b), net income includes the effect of the following items:

(i)

In 2017, a

$92 million

tax benefit related to changes in U.S. tax legislation partially offset by a

$29 million

loss associated with the early extinguishment of our 2019 Notes.

(ii)

In 2016, a

$70 million

gain related to a

$124 million

cash distribution from Easton Town Center, LLC, a

$42 million

tax benefit related to the favorable resolution of a discrete income tax matter, partially offset by a

$22 million

loss associated with the early extinguishment of our 2017 Notes.

(iii)

In 2015, a

$69 million

gain related to the divestiture of our remaining ownership interest in our third-party apparel sourcing business.

For additional information on these items, see the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item


. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The effect of the items described in (b) and (c) above decreased earnings per share by $0.51 in 2018, and increased earnings per share by $0.22 in 2017, and $0.23 in 2016 and 2015.

(d)

The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open or owned 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales is calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis.  Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2018, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were calculated on a 52-to-52-week basis, and the percentage change in comparable sales for 2017 was calculated on a 53-to-53-week basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis.

(e)

Number of stores and selling square feet excludes independently owned Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories, Victoria's Secret, PINK, Bath & Body Works and La Senza stores operated by our partners.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") as codified in the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"). The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in Item


. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Our operating results are generally impacted by economic changes and, therefore, we monitor the retail environment using, among other things, certain key industry performance indicators including competitor performance and mall traffic data. These can provide insight into consumer spending patterns and shopping behavior in the current retail environment and assist us in assessing our performance as well as the potential impact of industry trends on our future operating results. Additionally, we evaluate a number of key performance indicators including comparable sales, gross profit, operating income and other performance metrics such as sales per average selling square foot and inventory per selling square foot in assessing our performance.

Executive Overview

We have a multi-year goal to grow our business and increase operating margins for our brands by focusing on these key business priorities:

•

Grow our business in North America;

•

Extend our brands internationally; and

•

Focus on the fundamentals of our business.

We also continue to focus on:

•

Attracting and retaining top talent;

•

Maintaining a strong cash and liquidity position while optimizing our capital structure; and

•

Returning value to our shareholders.



The following is a discussion regarding certain of our key business priorities:

Grow our business in North America

Our number one priority is improving performance at Victoria's Secret by staying close to our customer, improving our assortment and improving the customer experience in stores and online.  We have new leaders at Victoria's Secret Lingerie and PINK, and we are looking at every aspect of our business: our marketing, brand positioning, internal talent, real estate portfolio, direct business and cost structure.  We are focused on improving our merchandise assortment.  We believe we have significant opportunities to improve our merchandise, making sure we have a robust product pipeline, fashion that our customers really want with high emotional content.  We will also be expanding our assortment to include new and previously exited categories, but doing some things differently through new licensing opportunities in eyewear and swimwear.

The core of Bath & Body Works is its body care, home fragrance products, soaps and sanitizers which together make up the majority of sales and profits for the business. We see clear opportunities for substantial growth in these categories by focusing on product newness and innovation and expanding into under-penetrated market and price segments. We will continue to invest in the White Barn concept, which continues to yield strong results. In


, we plan to increase our square footage at Bath & Body Works North America by about 3% through the opening of approximately 25 net new Bath & Body Works stores and the remodeling of existing stores.

Our Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works direct businesses, with $2.5 billion in sales and operating margins in excess of 20%, are growing rapidly at a mid-to-high-teens rate.  Our investment in technology and logistics will increase substantially in 2019 for initiatives supporting our direct businesses.

Extend our brands internationally

We believe there is substantial opportunity for international growth. We have separate, dedicated teams that have taken a methodical, "test and learn" approach to expansion. We expand our presence outside of North America by opening company-owned stores, as well as by increasing the number of stores operated by our international partners.

•

Victoria’s Secret International Stores

— We have made significant progress in expanding Victoria's Secret internationally.

Focus on the fundamentals of our business

We are focused on the fundamentals of our business which include knowing our customers, focusing on core merchandise categories, inventory management, speed and agility, managing real estate and store selling and execution. In terms of speed and agility, we are focused on inventory discipline through lead-time reductions and in-season agility to increase sales and reduce promotional activity.  In terms of real estate, we will continue to proactively and rigorously review our portfolio, and we will continue to open and close stores when we believe it makes sense to do so. Finally, we continue to optimize our store selling and execution by concentrating on a better store experience and developing, retaining and investing in talented, trained and productive store associates.


Overview

Our performance continues to be mixed.  Growth in operating income at Bath & Body Works was more than offset by a decline at Victoria’s Secret and Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International.  Our net sales

increased

$605 million

to

$13.237 billion

driven by a comparable sales increase of

3%

. Our operating income decreased

$491 million

to

$1.237 billion

, and our operating income rate decreased to

9.3%

from

13.7%

.



•

Victoria’s Secret has underperformed - major merchandise misses have resulted in increased promotion which negatively impacted margin rates. Victoria’s Secret segment comparable sales declined 2% for the year, and operating income declined 50%. By business unit:

◦

In Victoria’s Secret Lingerie, 2018 comparable sales declined in the low-single digit range.  We are seeing some improved performance in our newer bra launches.  However, growth in new styles has not been enough to offset the decline in older styles.  We made a substantial investment in sleepwear for the Holiday season, and the category delivered strong growth over last year.

◦

PINK comparable sales declined in the mid-single digit range in 2018, as fashion misses in apparel drove a decline in performance.

◦

Victoria’s Secret Beauty, with improved fashion, delivered low-double digit comparable sales growth in 2018.

•

Bath & Body Works has an experienced team with strong merchandising skills.  They have a close connection to the customer and a fast and agile supply chain, resulting in another record year, on top of a record 2017.  In 2018, Bath & Body Works comparable sales increased 11%, and operating income increased 13%.  Sales in the direct channel increased 30%.  We ended the year with more than 600 newly remodeled stores, which include the White Barn store design. These stores are driving significant sales growth and, importantly, present a new, compelling store experience for customers.

•

Revenue in our Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segment increased by 20% in 2018, and operating income declined, as improved performance in our franchise businesses was offset by underperformance in the U.K. and our investment in China.

Our recent overall performance at Victoria's Secret has been below our expectations, and we are determined to do better. By executing our strategy, focusing on the fundamentals, staying close to our customers and leveraging the strength of our brands, we are focused on meeting or exceeding the expectations of our stakeholders - customers, associates and shareholders.

At the end of the year, we made significant changes in our business to focus resources on core categories to enhance performance and accelerate growth. These actions include:

◦

Closing Henri Bendel;

◦

Selling the La Senza business; and

◦

Reducing our regular dividend to reduce debt levels.

We believe these decisions will strengthen our company.

The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open or owned 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales is calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis.  Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2018 was calculated on a 52-to-52-week basis, and the percentage change in comparable sales for 2017 was calculated on a 53-to-53-week basis.

For 2017, our other income (loss) decreased $97 million to a $10 million loss.  Activity in 2016 included a distribution received from Easton Town Center, LLC resulting in a pre-tax gain of $108 million, partially offset by a $36 million pre-tax loss on extinguishment of the 2017 Notes. In 2017, we recognized a $45 million pre-tax loss on extinguishment of the 2019 Notes, partially offset by gains related to distributions from certain of our Easton investments.

Provision for Income Taxes

For 2017, our effective tax rate decreased to 25.1% from 31.7%. The 2017 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the benefit related to changes in U.S. tax legislation. The 2016 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters.

Results of Operations—Fourth Quarter of 2017 Compared to Fourth Quarter of 2016

We utilize the retail calendar for reporting. As such, the results for the fourth quarter of 2017 represent the 14-week period ended February 3, 2018, and the results for the fourth quarter of 2016 represent the 13-week period ended January 28, 2017. The extra week accounted for approximately $160 million in incremental net sales and an estimated $46 million in incremental operating income in 2017.

Operating Income

The following table provides our segment operating income (loss) and operating income rates (expressed as a percentage of net sales) for the fourth quarter of 2017 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2016:

________________

(a)

Includes Mast Global, La Senza, Henri Bendel and Corporate.

For the fourth quarter of 2017, operating income decreased $1 million to $987 million, and the operating income rate decreased to 20.5% from 22.0%. The drivers of the operating income results are discussed in the following sections.



Net Sales

The following table provides net sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2016:

________________

(a)

Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada.

(b)

Includes Mast Global, La Senza, Henri Bendel and Corporate.

The following table provides a reconciliation of net sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2016:

The following table compares fourth quarter of 2017 comparable sales to fourth quarter of 2016:

________________

(a)

The percentage change in comparable sales represents direct and comparable store sales. The percentage change in comparable store sales represents the change in sales at comparable stores only and excludes the change in sales from our direct channels. A store is typically included in the calculation of comparable sales when it has been open or owned 12 months or more and it has not had a change in selling square footage of 20% or more. Additionally, stores of a given brand are excluded if total selling square footage for the brand in the mall changes by 20% or more through the opening or closing of a second store. The percentage change in comparable sales are calculated on a comparable calendar period as opposed to a fiscal basis. Therefore, the percentage change in comparable sales for 2017 was



calculated on a 14-to-14-week basis, and the percentage change in comparable sales for 2016 was calculated on a 13-to-13-week basis. Comparable sales attributable to our international stores are calculated on a constant currency basis.

(b)

Includes company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada.

The results by segment are as follows:

Victoria’s Secret

For the fourth quarter of 2017, net sales increased $80 million to $2.669 billion; comparable sales decreased 1%; and comparable store sales decreased 6%. Net sales increased in PINK, beauty and sport apparel driven by merchandise assortment that incorporated newness, innovation and fashion. These results were partially offset by a decrease in lingerie sales driven by a decline in unconstructed and sport bra performance.

The decrease in comparable store sales was driven primarily by lower traffic and lower average unit retail.

Bath & Body Works

For the fourth quarter of 2017, net sales increased $174 million to $1.794 billion; comparable sales increased 6%; and comparable store sales increased 4%. Net sales increased in the home fragrance and body care categories, which incorporated newness, innovation and fashion.

The increase in comparable store sales was driven by higher average unit retail.

Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International

Gross Profit

For the fourth quarter of 2017, our gross profit increased $96 million to $2.040 billion, and our gross profit rate (expressed as a percentage of net sales) decreased to 42.3% from 43.3% primarily as a result of:

Victoria’s Secret

For the fourth quarter of 2017, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales, partially offset by an increase in distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales.

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decrease in the merchandise margin rate primarily due to increased promotional activity.

Bath & Body Works

For the fourth quarter of 2017, the gross profit increase was driven by higher merchandise margin dollars related to the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to investments in store real estate and distribution and fulfillment expenses related to higher direct channel sales.

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by a decrease in the merchandise margin rate primarily due to increased promotional activity, partially offset by leverage of buying and occupancy expenses on higher sales.

Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International

For the fourth quarter of 2017, the gross profit increase was driven by increased merchandise margin dollars related to higher net sales in Greater China and additional stores opened by our partners, partially offset by higher occupancy expenses due to investments in store real estate in Greater China and at Victoria's Secret U.K.

The gross profit rate decrease was driven by an increase in occupancy expenses due to investments in store real estate in Greater China and at Victoria's Secret U.K.

General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses

For the fourth quarter of 2017, our general, administrative and store operating expenses increased $97 million to $1.053 billion driven by higher selling expenses due to higher sales volumes and an increase in marketing expenses primarily due to increased direct mail at Victoria's Secret.



The general, administrative and store operating expense rate increased to 21.8% from 21.3% primarily due to increased marketing expenses.

Provision for Income Taxes

For the fourth quarter of 2017, our effective tax rate decreased to 21.1% from 29.2%. The 2017 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the benefit related to changes in U.S. tax legislation. The 2016 rate was lower than our combined estimated federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the resolution of certain tax matters.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining our financial stability. We are committed to maintaining adequate liquidity. Cash generated from our operating activities provides the primary resources to support current operations, growth initiatives, seasonal funding requirements and capital expenditures. Our cash provided from operations is impacted by our net income and working capital changes. Our net income is impacted by, among other things, sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, success of new product introductions, profit margins and income taxes. Historically, sales are higher during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, our need for working capital peaks during the summer and fall months as inventory builds in anticipation of the holiday period.  The majority of our cash and cash equivalents were held by domestic subsidiaries as of

February 2, 2019

.  Our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were

$413 million

as of

February 2, 2019

.

We are committed to returning value to our shareholders.  During


, we paid

$666 million

in dividends and repurchased

$196 million

of our common stock. We use cash flow generated from operating and financing activities to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs.



The following table provides our outstanding debt balance, net of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, as of

notes due in January 2027 and

$52 million

in cash consideration, which included a

$24 million

Debt

, and no gain or loss was recognized. The exchange premium will be amortized through the maturity date of January 2027 and is included within Long-term Debt on the

February 2, 2019

Consolidated Balance Sheet. The obligation to pay principal and interest on the 2027 Notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by certain of our 100% owned subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”).

Issuance of Notes

In January 2018, we issued

$500 million

$540 million

. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of this debt of

$45 million

(after-tax loss of

$29 million

), which includes write-offs of unamortized issuance costs and discounts and losses related to terminated interest rate swaps associated with the 2019 Notes.  This loss is included in Other Income (Loss) in the 2017 Consolidated Statement of Income.

Secured Revolving Facility

We and the Guarantors guarantee and pledge collateral to secure a revolving credit facility ("Secured Revolving Facility"). The Secured Revolving Facility has aggregate availability of

The Secured Revolving Facility fees related to committed and unutilized amounts are

0.25%

per annum, and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit are

per annum. In addition, the interest rate on outstanding U.S. dollar borrowings is the



London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus

1.50%

per annum. The interest rate on outstanding foreign denominated borrowings is the applicable benchmark rate plus

1.50%

per annum.

The Secured Revolving Facility contains fixed charge coverage and debt to EBITDA financial covenants. We are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than

1.75

Credit Ratings

Our borrowing costs under our Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities are linked to our credit ratings. If we receive an upgrade or downgrade to our corporate credit ratings, the borrowing costs could decrease or increase, respectively. The guarantees of our obligations under the Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities by the Guarantors and the security interests granted in our and the Guarantors’ collateral securing such obligations are released if our credit ratings are higher than a certain level. Additionally, the restrictions imposed under the Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Foreign Facilities on our ability to make investments and to make restricted payments cease to apply if our credit ratings are higher than certain levels. Credit rating downgrades by any of the agencies do not accelerate the repayment of any of our debt.

The following table provides our credit ratings as of

The following table provides our contractual obligations, aggregated by type, including the maturity profile as of

February 2, 2019

:

________________

(a)

Long-term debt obligations relate to our principal and interest payments for outstanding notes and debentures. Interest payments have been estimated based on the coupon rate for fixed rate obligations. Interest obligations exclude amounts which have been accrued through

February 2, 2019

. For additional information, see Note


to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item


. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

(b)

Operating lease obligations primarily represent minimum payments due under store lease agreements. For additional information, see Note

. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

(c)

Purchase obligations primarily include purchase orders for merchandise inventory and other agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.

(d)

Other liabilities primarily include future payments relating to our nonqualified supplemental retirement plan of

$278 million

which have been reflected under “Other” as the timing of these future payments is not known until an associate leaves the Company or otherwise requests an in-service distribution. Other liabilities also include future estimated payments associated with unrecognized tax benefits. The “Less Than 1 Year” category includes

$84 million

of these tax items because it is reasonably possible that the amounts could change in the next 12 months due to audit settlements or resolution of uncertainties. The remaining portion totaling $42 million is included in the “Other” category as it is not reasonably possible that the amounts could change in the next 12 months. In addition, we have a remaining liability of $31 million related to the deemed repatriation tax on our undistributed foreign earnings resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  The tax liability will be paid over the next seven years.  For additional information, see Note


to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item


. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

In connection with the sale of La Senza, we have remaining guarantees of

$76 million

related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through 2028.  These guarantees include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to



the disposition of the business.  We recognized an initial liability of

$5 million

representing the estimated fair value of our obligation as guarantor in accordance with ASC 460,

Guarantees.

In connection with the disposition of a certain other business, we have remaining guarantees of

$6 million

related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through


. These guarantees include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of the business. In certain instances, our guarantee may remain in effect if the term of a lease is extended. We have not recorded a liability with respect to these guarantee obligations as of

February 2, 2019

or

February 3, 2018

as we concluded that payments under these guarantees were not probable.

In connection with noncancelable operating leases of certain assets, we provided residual value guarantees to the lessor if the leased assets cannot be sold for an amount in excess of a specified minimum value at the conclusion of the lease term. The leases expire at various dates through 2021, and the total amount of the guarantees is

$94 million

. We recorded a liability of

$11 million

and

$3 million

related to these guarantee obligations as of

February 2, 2019

and

February 3, 2018

, respectively, which are included in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation 229.303 Item 303 (a) (4).

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, which was further clarified and amended in 2015 and 2016. This guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also results in enhanced disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

We adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2018 under the modified retrospective approach. Under the standard, income from the Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement, which was historically presented as a reduction to General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses, is presented as revenue. Further, historical accounting related to loyalty points earned under the Victoria's Secret customer loyalty program changed as we now defer revenue associated with customer loyalty points until the points are redeemed using a relative stand-alone selling price method. The standard also changed accounting for sales returns which requires balance sheet presentation on a gross basis.

In the first quarter of 2018, we recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment resulting in a reduction to opening retained earnings, net of tax, of

$28 million

. The cumulative adjustment primarily related to the deferral of revenue related to outstanding points, net of estimated forfeitures, under the Victoria's Secret customer loyalty program. In addition, Net Sales and General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses both increased

$187 million

in the 2018 Consolidated Statement of Income. Further, gross presentation of our sales return reserve resulted in a

$5 million

increase in Other Current Assets and Accrued Expenses and Other on the

February 2, 2019

Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASC 321,

Investments - Equity Securities

, which addresses certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  The standard requires the recognition of changes in the fair value of marketable equity securities in net income as compared to historical treatment in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2018 and recorded an increase to opening retained earnings, net of tax, of

$2 million

.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASC 842,

Leases

, which is effective beginning in fiscal 2019 and requires companies classified as lessees to account for most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to today’s accounting. The standard also will result in enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, to provide greater insight into the extent of revenue and expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing leases.  In July 2018, the FASB approved an amendment to the standard that provides companies a transition option that would not require earlier periods to be restated upon adoption.



We will adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2019 and apply the standard prospectively as of the adoption date.  As allowed by the new standard, we elected the package of transition practical expedients but have elected to not apply the hindsight practical expedient to our leases at transition.

Substantially all of our leases, including our retail store locations, are subject to operating lease accounting under the new standard.  We expect to recognize right-of-use assets of approximately

$3.3 billion

and related lease liabilities of approximately

$3.7 billion

on our Consolidated Balance Sheet upon adoption at the beginning of fiscal 2019.  These balances will change as our lease portfolio changes due to execution of lease modifications or new leases.  The right-of-use assets are based upon the lease liabilities adjusted for deferred rent liabilities and unamortized landlord construction allowances.  We will continue to recognize rent expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Hedging Activities

In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-12,

Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities

, which is intended to better align risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships. The standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. It also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements. We will adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Goodwill

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04,

Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill.  The standard eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the implied fair value of goodwill.  Under the new standard, the goodwill impairment charge will be the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.  This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted.  We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Impact of Inflation

While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, long-lived assets, claims and contingencies, income taxes and revenue recognition. Management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position.

Inventories

Inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, on a weighted-average cost basis.

We record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates.

We also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory. These estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends.

Management believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate. A 10% increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately

$5 million

for


. A 10% increase



or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately

$5 million

for


.

Valuation of Long-lived Assets

Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of other assets or asset groups.  If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset or asset group are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value, usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group. When a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life.

Goodwill is reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. We have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value (including goodwill), or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value (including goodwill). If we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, including the implied fair value of goodwill, through either estimated discounted future cash flows or market-based methodologies. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference. Our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350,

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other

.  Our reporting units that have goodwill are Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works and Greater China.

Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. We have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value.  To determine if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, we will estimate the fair value, usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset, and compare that value with its carrying amount.  If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference.

We estimate the fair value of property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurement

. If future economic conditions are different than those projected by management, future impairment charges may be required.

Claims and Contingencies

We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, insurance, regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. Our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency. We consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. We accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible (as opposed to probable) or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable, disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item


. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.

Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In determining our provision for income taxes, we consider permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates. Our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings.



We follow the authoritative guidance included in ASC 740,

Income Taxes

, which contains a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may differ from forecasted outcomes. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual, when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.

Revenue Recognition

In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, using the modified retrospective approach.

We recognize revenue based on the amount we expect to receive when control of the goods or services is transferred to our customer. We recognize sales upon customer receipt of merchandise, which for direct channel revenues reflect an estimate of shipments that have not yet been received by our customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times. Our shipping and handling revenues are included in Net Sales with the related costs included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience. Net Sales exclude sales and other similar taxes collected from customers.

We offer certain loyalty programs that allow customers to earn points based on purchasing activity. As customers accumulate points and reach point thresholds, they can use the points to purchase merchandise in stores or online. We allocate revenue to points earned on qualifying purchases and defer recognition until the points are redeemed. The amount of revenue deferred is based on the relative stand-alone selling price method, which includes an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed based on historical experience.

We sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers. We do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards. We recognize revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer. In addition, we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions (gift card breakage). Gift card breakage revenue is recognized in proportion, and over the same period, as actual gift card redemptions. We determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage is included in Net Sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Revenue earned in connection with Victoria’s Secret's private label credit card arrangement is recognized over the term of the license arrangement and is included in Net Sales in our 2018 Consolidated Statement of Income.

We also recognize revenues associated with franchise, license, wholesale and sourcing arrangements. Revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers. Revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Market Risk

The market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use derivative financial instruments like foreign currency forward contracts, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

We have operations in foreign countries which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our Canadian dollar, British pound, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong dollar and Euro denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all our merchandise sold in Canada, the U.K., Ireland and Greater China is sourced



through U.S. dollar transactions. Although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset risks associated with Canadian dollar and British pound denominated earnings, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all the short-term impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the long-term impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates.

Further, although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in U.S. dollars, the royalties we receive in U.S. dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency. As a result, our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Interest Rate Risk

Our investment portfolio primarily consists of interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy, which specifies permitted types of investments, specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer. The primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal, the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk. Typically, our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits. Given the short-term nature and quality of investments in our portfolio, we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates.

Excluding our Foreign Facilities, all of our long-term debt as of

February 2, 2019

has fixed interest rates. We will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements. Our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued, which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following table provides a summary of the principal value and estimated fair value of outstanding publicly traded debt as of

February 2, 2019

and

February 3, 2018

:

________________

(a)

The estimated fair value is based on reported transaction prices. The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange.

(b)

Hedge arrangements are in a net liability (asset) position.

As of

February 2, 2019

, we believe that the carrying values of accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and current debt approximate fair value because of their short maturity.

Concentration of Credit Risk

We maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. We monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. Typically, our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits. We also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

February 2, 2019

. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).

Based on our assessment and the COSO criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of

February 2, 2019

.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young LLP’s report appears on the following page and expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

February 2, 2019

.

.

Basis of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The Company accounts for investments in unconsolidated entities where it exercises significant influence, but does not have control, using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company recognizes its share of the investee's net income or loss. Losses are only recognized to the extent the Company has positive carrying value related to the investee. Carrying values are only reduced below

zero

if the Company has an obligation to provide funding to the investee. The Company’s share of net income or loss of unconsolidated entities from which the Company purchases merchandise or merchandise components is included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company’s share of net income or loss of all other unconsolidated entities is included in Other Income (Loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company’s equity method investments are required to be reviewed for impairment when it is determined there may be an other than temporary loss in value.

La Senza

On January 6, 2019, the Company completed the sale of the La Senza business.  For additional information, see Note


, "Restructuring Activities."

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and Cash Equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions and highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than


days. The Company’s outstanding checks, which totaled

$13 million

as of

February 2, 2019

and

$14 million

as of

February 3, 2018

, are included in Accounts Payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions. The Company monitors the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom the Company transacts and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. Typically, the Company’s investment portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. government obligations, U.S. Treasury and AAA-rated money market funds, commercial paper and bank deposits.

The Company also periodically reviews the relative credit standing of franchise, license and wholesale partners and other entities to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company records an allowance for uncollectable accounts when it becomes probable that the counterparty will be unable to pay.

Marketable Equity Securities

These investments are recorded at fair value in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Beginning in 2018, the Company recognizes unrealized holding gains and losses in Other Income (Loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.



Prior to 2018, unrealized holding gains and losses were recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.

Inventories

Inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, on a weighted-average cost basis.

The Company records valuation adjustments to its inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount it expects to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience.

The Company also records inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory. These estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends.

Advertising Costs

Advertising and marketing costs are expensed at the time the promotion first appears in media, in the store or when the advertising is mailed. Advertising and marketing costs totaled

$476 million

for


,

$383 million

for


and

$325 million

for


.

Property and Equipment

The Company’s property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis using the following depreciable life ranges:

When a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life. The Company’s cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major renewals and betterments that extend useful lives are capitalized.

Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of other assets or asset groups.  If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset or asset group are less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value, usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company has certain intangible assets resulting from business combinations and acquisitions that are recorded at cost. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.

Goodwill is reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. The Company has the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value (including goodwill), or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value (including goodwill).  If the Company determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company then estimates the fair value of all assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, including the implied fair value of goodwill, through either estimated discounted future cash flows or market-based methodologies. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment charge equal to the difference. The Company's reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350,

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other

. The Company's reporting units that have goodwill are Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works and Greater China.



Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change. The Company has the option to either first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. To determine if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, the Company will estimate the fair value, usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset, and compare that value with its carrying amount.  If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds the fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment charge equal to the difference.

If future economic conditions are different than those projected by management, future impairment charges may be required.

Leases and Leasehold Improvements

The Company has leases that contain predetermined fixed escalations of minimum rentals and/or rent abatements subsequent to taking possession of the leased property. The Company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight-line basis commencing upon the store possession date. The Company records the difference between the recognized rental expense and amounts payable under the leases as deferred lease credits. The Company’s liability for predetermined fixed escalations of minimum rentals and/or rent abatements totaled

$220 million

as of

February 2, 2019

and

$210 million

as of

February 3, 2018

. These liabilities are included in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company receives construction allowances from landlords related to its retail stores. These allowances are generally comprised of cash amounts received by the Company from its landlords as part of the negotiated lease terms. The Company records a receivable and a landlord allowance at the lease commencement date (date of initial possession of the store). The landlord allowance is amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease (including the pre-opening build-out period), and the receivable is reduced as amounts are received from the landlord. The Company’s unamortized portion of landlord allowances, which totaled

$278 million

as of

February 2, 2019

and

$293 million

as of

February 3, 2018

, is included in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company also has leasehold improvements which are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the period from the date the assets are placed in service to the end of the initial lease term. Leasehold improvements made after the inception of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term, including renewal periods, if reasonably assured.

For information regarding the future impacts as a result of the Company's adoption of ASC 842,

Leases,

in the first quarter of 2019, refer to Note 2, "New Accounting Pronouncements."

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of the Company’s foreign operations is generally the applicable local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. The Company’s resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.  Accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments are reclassified to net income when realized upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the investment in the foreign entity.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. All derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.

For derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged item affects earnings. Gains and losses that are reclassified into earnings are recognized in the same line item on the Consolidated Statement of Income as the underlying hedged item. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge ineffectiveness, if any, are recognized in current earnings.

For derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument has an equal and offsetting impact to the carrying value of the liability on the balance sheet.

For derivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings in Other Income (Loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Income.



Fair Value

The authoritative guidance included in ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurement,

defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. This authoritative guidance further establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

•

Level 1—Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices of similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

•

Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

The Company estimates the fair value of financial instruments, property and equipment and goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 820

.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.

In determining the Company’s provision for income taxes, the Company considers permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates. The Company’s effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings.

The Company follows a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than

50%

likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may differ from forecasted outcomes.

The Company’s income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding the Company’s tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which the Company has established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified. The Company adjusts its tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from its established accrual, when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. The Company includes its tax contingencies accrual, including accrued penalties and interest, in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets unless the liability is expected to be paid within one year. Changes to the tax contingencies accrual, including accrued penalties and interest, are included in Provision for Income Taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Self-Insurance

The Company is self-insured for medical, workers’ compensation, property, general liability and automobile liability up to certain stop-loss limits. Such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. IBNR claims are estimated using historical claim information and actuarial estimates.



Noncontrolling Interest

Noncontrolling interest represents the portion of equity interests of consolidated affiliates not owned by the Company.

Share-based Compensation

The Company recognizes all share-based payments to employees and directors as compensation cost over the service period based on their estimated fair value on the date of grant.  The Company estimates award forfeitures at the time awards are granted and adjusts, if necessary, in subsequent periods based on historical experience and expected future forfeitures.

Compensation cost is recognized over the service period for the fair value of awards that actually vest. Compensation expense for awards without a performance condition is recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, using a single award approach (each award is valued as one grant, irrespective of the number of vesting tranches). Compensation expense for awards with a performance condition is recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, using a multiple award approach (each vesting tranche is valued as one grant).

Revenue Recognition

In the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, using the modified retrospective approach. Results for 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period consolidated financial statements have not been adjusted and continue to be presented under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.

The Company recognizes revenue based on the amount it expects to receive when control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer. The Company recognizes sales upon customer receipt of merchandise, which for direct channel revenues reflect an estimate of shipments that have not yet been received by the customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times. The Company’s shipping and handling revenues are included in Net Sales with the related costs included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company also provides a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience. Net Sales exclude sales and other similar taxes collected from customers.

The Company offers certain loyalty programs that allow customers to earn points based on purchasing activity. As customers accumulate points and reach point thresholds, they can use the points to purchase merchandise in stores or online. The Company allocates revenue to points earned on qualifying purchases and defers recognition until the points are redeemed. The amount of revenue deferred is based on the relative stand-alone selling price method, which includes an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed based on historical experience.

The Company sells gift cards with no expiration dates to customers. The Company does not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards. The Company recognizes revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer. In addition, the Company recognizes revenue on unredeemed gift cards where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions (gift card breakage). Gift card breakage revenue is recognized in proportion, and over the same period, as actual gift card redemptions. The Company determines the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns. Gift card breakage is included in Net Sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Revenue earned in connection with Victoria’s Secret's private label credit card arrangement is recognized over the term of the license arrangement and is included in Net Sales in the 2018 Consolidated Statement of Income.

The Company also recognizes revenues associated with franchise, license, wholesale and sourcing arrangements. Revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers. Revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner.

Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy

The Company’s costs of goods sold include merchandise costs, net of discounts and allowances, freight and inventory shrinkage. The Company’s buying and occupancy expenses primarily include payroll, benefit costs and operating expenses for its buying departments and distribution network, rent, common area maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance, fulfillment expenses and depreciation for the Company’s stores, warehouse facilities and equipment.



General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses

The Company’s general, administrative and store operating expenses primarily include payroll and benefit costs for its store-selling and administrative departments (including corporate functions), marketing, advertising and other operating expenses not specifically categorized elsewhere in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.

2. New Accounting Pronouncements

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, which was further clarified and amended in 2015 and 2016. This guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also results in enhanced disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

The Company adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2018 under the modified retrospective approach. Under the standard, income from the Victoria's Secret private label credit card arrangement, which was historically presented as a reduction to General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses, is presented as revenue. Further, historical accounting related to loyalty points earned under the Victoria's Secret customer loyalty program changed as the Company now defers revenue associated with customer loyalty points until the points are redeemed using a relative stand-alone selling price method. The standard also changed accounting for sales returns which requires balance sheet presentation on a gross basis.

In the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment resulting in a reduction to opening retained earnings, net of tax, of

$28 million

. The cumulative adjustment primarily related to the deferral of revenue related to outstanding points, net of estimated forfeitures, under the Victoria's Secret customer loyalty program. In addition, Net Sales and General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses both increased

$187 million

in the 2018 Consolidated Statement of Income. Further, gross presentation of the Company's sales return reserve resulted in a

$5 million

increase in Other Current Assets and Accrued Expenses and Other on the

February 2, 2019

Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASC 321,

Investments - Equity Securities

, which addresses certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  The standard requires the recognition of changes in the fair value of marketable equity securities in net income as compared to historical treatment in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet. The Company adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2018 and recorded an increase to opening retained earnings, net of tax, of

$2 million

.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASC 842,

Leases

, which is effective beginning in fiscal 2019 and requires companies classified as lessees to account for most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to today’s accounting. The standard also will result in enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, to provide greater insight into the extent of revenue and expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing leases.  In July 2018, the FASB approved an amendment to the standard that provides companies a transition option that would not require earlier periods to be restated upon adoption.

The Company will adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2019 and apply the standard prospectively as of the adoption date.   As allowed by the new standard, the Company elected the package of transition practical expedients but has elected to not apply the hindsight practical expedient to its leases at transition.

Substantially all of the Company's leases, including our retail store locations, are subject to operating lease accounting under the new standard.  The Company expects to recognize right-of-use assets of approximately

$3.3 billion

and related lease liabilities of approximately

$3.7 billion

in its Consolidated Balance Sheet upon adoption at the beginning of fiscal 2019.  These balances will change as the lease portfolio changes due to execution of lease modifications or new leases.  The right-of-use



assets are based upon the lease liabilities adjusted for deferred rent liabilities and unamortized landlord construction allowances.  The Company will continue to recognize rent expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Hedging Activities

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12,

Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities

, which is intended to better align risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships. The standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item. It also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements. The Company will adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Goodwill

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04,

Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill.  The standard eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the implied fair value of goodwill.  Under the new standard, the goodwill impairment charge will be the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.  This guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted.  The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

3. Revenue Recognition

In the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, using the modified retrospective approach. Results for 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period consolidated financial statements have not been adjusted and continue to be presented under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.

Accounts receivable, net from revenue-generating activities were

$150 million

as of

February 2, 2019

and

$144 million

as of the beginning of the period upon adoption of the new standard. Accounts receivable primarily relate to amounts due from the Company's franchise, license and wholesale partners. Under these arrangements, payment terms are typically 60 to 75 days.

The Company records deferred revenue when cash payments are received in advance of transfer of control of goods or services. Deferred revenue primarily relates to gift cards, loyalty and private label credit card programs and direct channel shipments, which are all impacted by seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. The balance of deferred revenue was

$331 million

as of

February 2, 2019

and

$320 million

as of the beginning of the period upon adoption of the new standard. The Company recognized

$224 million

as revenue in


from amounts recorded as deferred revenue at the beginning of the period. The Company's deferred revenue balance would have been

$287 million

as of

February 2, 2019

under accounting standards in effect prior to the adoption of the new standard. As of

February 2, 2019

, the Company recorded deferred revenues of

$316 million

within Accrued Expenses and Other, and

$15 million

within Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

5. Acquisition

On April 18, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of American Beauty Limited for a total purchase price of

$44 million

. This agreement included the reacquisition of the franchise rights from one of our partners to operate Victoria's Secret Beauty and Accessories stores in Greater China, including


stores already open at the time of acquisition. The purchase price included

$10 million

in forgiveness of liabilities owed to the Company from the pre-existing relationship. As a result of this acquisition, the Company's financial statements include the financial results of American Beauty Limited, which are reported as part of the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segment.

The total purchase price was allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair value. Such estimated fair values require management to make estimates and judgments, especially with respect to intangible assets. The allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was complete as of the second quarter of


. Goodwill related to the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.

The allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as follows:



6. Restructuring Activities

La Senza

On January 6, 2019, in an effort to increase shareholder value and in order to focus on its larger core businesses, the Company divested its ownership interest in La Senza to an affiliate of Regent LP, a global private equity firm.  Regent LP assumed La Senza’s operating assets and liabilities in exchange for potential future consideration upon the sale or other monetization of La Senza, as defined in the agreement.  In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recognized a pre-tax loss on the divestiture of

$99 million

, primarily related to

$45 million

of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments reclassified into earnings that were previously recognized as a component of equity, as well as losses related to the transfer of the net working capital and long-lived store assets to the buyer.  The loss is included in Loss on Divestiture of La Senza in the 2018 Consolidated Statement of Income.  The after-tax loss on the divestiture was

$55 million

, which includes

$44 million

of tax benefits primarily associated with the recognition of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets.

In conjunction with the transaction, the Company has guaranteed certain lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases.  For additional information, see Note


, "Commitments and Contingencies."

Additionally, the Company will continue to provide support to La Senza in various operational areas including logistics, technology and merchandise sourcing for periods of time ranging from one month to eighteen months.

Henri Bendel

In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company closed all Henri Bendel stores and ceased selling merchandise online.

The Company announced the planned closure of Henri Bendel in the third quarter of 2018.  As a result, the Company recognized a pre-tax charge, primarily cash, consisting of lease termination costs, severance and other costs of

$20 million

in the third quarter.  In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recognized an additional pre-tax charge of

$3 million

, primarily related to contract termination and employee retention costs.  Restructuring charges of

$14 million

and

$9 million

are included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy and General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses, respectively, in the 2018 Consolidated Statement of Income.  Through the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company made cash payments of

$16 million

. The remaining balance of

$7 million

is included in Accrued Expenses and Other on the

February 2, 2019

Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Victoria's Secret

During the first quarter of 2016, the Company made strategic changes within the Victoria’s Secret segment designed to focus the brand on its core merchandise categories, streamline operations and emphasize brand building and loyalty-enhancing marketing and advertising rather than using traditional catalogues and offers. As a result of these actions, the Company recorded charges related to cancellations of fabric commitments for non-go forward merchandise and a reserve against paper that was previously intended for future catalogues. These costs, totaling

$11 million

, including non-cash charges of

$10 million

, are included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy on the 2016 Consolidated Statement of Income. These actions also resulted in the elimination of approximately


positions primarily in the Company's Ohio and New York home offices. Severance and related costs associated with these eliminations, totaling

$24 million

, are included in General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses on the 2016 Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company recognized a total pre-tax charge of

$35 million

for these items in the first quarter of 2016.

During


, the Company concluded that the negative operating results for certain of its Victoria's Secret stores were an indicator of potential impairment of the related long-lived store assets. The Company determined that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying values and, as a result, recognized a loss equal to the difference between the carrying values and the estimated fair values, determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows. As a result, the Company recognized impairment charges of

$81 million

and

$20 million

in the third and fourth quarter of 2018, respectively.  These charges are included in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying & Occupancy in the


Consolidated Statement of Income.  Impairment charges of

$70 million

, related to stores in the U.S. and Canada, were recorded within the Victoria's Secret segment. Impairment charges of

$31 million

, related to stores in the U.K., were recorded within the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International segment.

In


, the Company completed a sale and leaseback transaction under a noncancelable operating lease of a certain asset. The carrying value of the asset sold under this arrangement was

$51 million

. Proceeds of

$51 million

are included in Proceeds from Sale of Assets within the Investing Activities section of the


Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. For additional information, see Note

10. Equity Investments

Easton Investments

The Company has land and other investments in Easton, a planned community in Columbus, Ohio, that integrates office, hotel, retail, residential and recreational space. These investments, totaling

$89 million

as of

February 2, 2019

and

$81 million

as of

February 3, 2018

, are recorded in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Included in the Company’s Easton investments are equity interests in Easton Town Center, LLC (“ETC”) and Easton Gateway, LLC (“EG”), entities that own and develop commercial entertainment and shopping centers. The Company’s investments in ETC and EG are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Company has a majority financial interest in ETC and EG, but another unaffiliated member manages them, and certain significant decisions regarding ETC and EG require the consent of unaffiliated members in addition to the Company.

The Company received cash distributions of

$16 million

and

$29 million

from certain of its Easton investments during


and


, respectively, which are included as return of capital within Investing Activities of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As a result of these distributions, the Company recognized pre-tax gains totaling

The Company adopted ASC 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

, under the modified retrospective approach.  As such, balances as of

February 3, 2018

have not been adjusted.



12. Income Taxes

Current income tax expense represents the amounts expected to be reported on the Company’s income tax returns, and deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in net deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded as appropriate to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount considered likely to be realized.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") was enacted into law. The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The TCJA reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of

35%

to a flat

21%

rate, effective January 1, 2018.

On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) to address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA. The ultimate impact may differ from provisional amounts, due to changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made regarding application of the TCJA as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued.  The Company recognized

$159 million

tax benefit related to revaluing the ending net deferred tax liabilities and recognized

$67 million

of tax expense related to the deemed mandatory repatriation in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended February 3, 2018. As of February 2, 2019, the Company has completed its determination of the accounting implications of the TCJA.

and

February 3, 2018

. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future effects on income taxes resulting from temporary differences and carryforwards at the end of the respective year.

As of

February 2, 2019

, the Company had available for state income tax purposes net operating loss carryforwards which expire, if unused, in the years

2019 through 2037

. For those states where the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that the state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance has been provided.

As of

February 2, 2019

, the Company had available for non-U.S. tax purposes net operating loss carryforwards which have an indefinite life and net operating loss carryforwards which expire, if unused, in the years

2028 through 2038

. For certain jurisdictions where the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that the net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance has been provided on those net operating loss carryforwards as well as other net deferred tax assets.

Income tax payments were

Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, it is reasonably possible that

$84 million

could change in the next 12 months due to audit settlements, expiration of statute of limitations or other resolution of uncertainties. Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in amounts which could be different



from this estimate. In such case, the Company will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such matters are effectively settled.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as components of income tax expense. The Company recognized an income tax benefit from interest and penalties of

$5 million

,

$2 million

and

$3 million

in


,


and


, respectively. The Company has accrued

$12 million

and

$17 million

for the payment of interest and penalties as of

February 2, 2019

and

February 3, 2018

, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties are included within Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company files U.S. federal income tax returns as well as income tax returns in various states and in non-U.S. jurisdictions. The Company is a participant in the Compliance Assurance Process ("CAP"), which is a program made available by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") to certain qualifying large taxpayers, under which participants work collaboratively with the IRS to identify and resolve potential tax issues through open, cooperative and transparent interaction prior to the annual filing of their federal income tax return.  The IRS is currently examining the Company's 2017 consolidated U.S. federal income tax return.

The Company is also subject to various U.S. state and local income tax examinations for the years

2012 to 2017

. Finally, the Company is subject to multiple non-U.S. tax jurisdiction examinations for the years

2007 to 2017

. In some situations, the Company determines that it does not have a filing requirement in a particular tax jurisdiction. Where no return has been filed, no statute of limitations applies. Accordingly, if a tax jurisdiction reaches a conclusion that a filing requirement does exist, additional years may be reviewed by the tax authority. The Company believes it has appropriately accounted for uncertainties related to this issue.

14. Derivative Financial Instruments

Foreign Exchange Derivative Instruments

The earnings of the Company's wholly owned foreign businesses are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all their merchandise is sourced through U.S. dollar transactions. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate this foreign currency exposure for its Canadian and U.K. businesses. These forward contracts currently have a maximum term of


months. Amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income upon sale of the hedged merchandise to the customer. These gains and losses are recognized in Costs of Goods Sold, Buying and Occupancy in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Company had a cross-currency swap related to an intercompany loan of approximately CAD

$170 million

that matured in January 2018 which was designated as a cash flow hedge of foreign currency exchange risk. This cross-currency swap mitigated the exposures to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange rate related to the Company's Canadian operations.  Changes in the U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar exchange rate and the related swap settlements resulted in reclassification of amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings to completely offset foreign currency transaction gains and losses recognized on the intercompany loan.

The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to recognized payable balances denominated in non-functional currencies. The fair value of these non-designated foreign currency forward contracts is not significant as of

February 2, 2019

.

The following table provides the U.S. dollar notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivative financial instruments as of

February 2, 2019

and

February 3, 2018

No

ineffectiveness was associated with these foreign currency cash flow hedges.

(b)

Represents reclassification of amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings to completely offset foreign currency transaction gains and losses recognized on the intercompany loan.

The Company estimates that

$3 million

of net gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of

February 2, 2019

related to foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges will be reclassified into earnings within the



following 12 months. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified depend on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts that are currently outstanding mature.

15. Fair Value Measurements

The following table provides a summary of assets and liabilities measured in the consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis as of

February 2, 2019

and

February 3, 2018

:

The Company's Level 1 fair value measurements use unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company's marketable equity securities are classified as Level 1 fair value measurements as they are traded with sufficient frequency and volume to enable the Company to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASC 321,

Investments - Equity Securities

. The standard requires the recognition of changes in the fair value of the Company's marketable equity securities in net income as compared to historical treatment in accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2018. The Company recognized unrealized losses of

$6 million

in 2018 related to its marketable equity securities in Other Income (Loss) in the 2018 Consolidated Statement of Income.

In 2017, the Company purchased

$10 million

of marketable equity securities which are classified as available-for-sale. The cash payment is included in Purchases of Marketable Equity Securities in the Investing Activities section of the 2017 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

In 2015, the Company purchased

$10 million

in marketable equity securities. In the first quarter of 2016, the Company sold a portion of this investment for

$10 million

and recognized a pre-tax gain of

$4 million

(after-tax gain of

$3 million

). The gain is included in Other Income (Loss) in the 2016 Consolidated Statement of Income, and the cash proceeds are included in Proceeds from Sale of Marketable Equity Securities in the Investing Activities section of the 2016 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

The Company’s Level 2 fair value measurements use market approach valuation techniques. The primary inputs to these techniques include benchmark interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as applicable to the underlying instruments.



The following table provides a summary of the principal value and estimated fair value of outstanding publicly traded debt as of

February 2, 2019

and

February 3, 2018

:

________________

(a)

The estimated fair value of the Company’s publicly traded debt is based on reported transaction prices which are considered Level 2 inputs in accordance with ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurement

. The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange.

Management believes that the carrying values of accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and current debt approximate fair value because of their short maturity.

16. Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive Income includes gains and losses on derivative instruments and foreign currency translation adjustments. The cumulative gains and losses on these items are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity (Deficit).

Actions filed against the Company from time to time include commercial, tort, intellectual property, customer, employment, data privacy, securities and other claims, including purported class action lawsuits. Management believes that the ultimate liability arising from such claims and contingencies, if any, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Guarantees

In connection with the sale of La Senza, the Company has remaining guarantees of

$76 million

related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through 2028.  These guarantees include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of the business. The Company recognized an initial liability of

$5 million

representing the estimated fair value of its obligation as guarantor in accordance with ASC 460,

Guarantees.

In connection with the disposition of a certain other business, the Company has remaining guarantees of

$6 million

related to lease payments under the current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through


. These guarantees include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes, common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of the business. In certain instances, the Company’s guarantee may remain in effect if the term of a lease is extended. The Company has not recorded a liability with respect to these guarantee obligations as of

February 2, 2019

or

February 3, 2018

as it concluded that payments under these guarantees were not probable.

In connection with noncancelable operating leases of certain assets, the Company provided residual value guarantees to the lessor if the leased assets cannot be sold for an amount in excess of a specified minimum value at the conclusion of the lease term. The leases expire at various dates through 2021, and the total amount of the guarantees is

$94 million

. The Company recorded a liability of

$11 million

and

$3 million

related to these guarantee obligations as of

February 2, 2019

and

February 3, 2018

, respectively, which are included in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

19. Retirement Benefits

The Company sponsors a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan and a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for substantially all of its associates within the U.S. Participation in the tax-qualified plan is available to associates who meet certain age and service requirements. Participation in the non-qualified plan is available to associates who meet certain age, service, job level and compensation requirements.

The qualified plan permits participating associates to elect contributions up to the maximum limits allowable under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches associate contributions according to a predetermined formula and contributes additional amounts based on a percentage of the associates’ eligible annual compensation and years of service. Associate contributions and Company matching contributions vest immediately. Additional Company contributions and the related investment earnings are subject to vesting based on years of service. Total expense recognized related to the qualified plan was

$76 million

for


,

$68 million

for


and

$67 million

for


.

The non-qualified plan is an unfunded plan which provides benefits beyond the Internal Revenue Code limits for qualified defined contribution plans. The plan permits participating associates to elect contributions up to a maximum percentage of eligible compensation. The Company matches associate contributions according to a predetermined formula and contributes additional amounts based on a percentage of the associates’ eligible compensation and years of service. The plan also permits participating associates to defer additional compensation up to a maximum amount which the Company does not match. Associates’ accounts are credited with interest using a fixed rate determined by the Company and reviewed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, prior to the beginning of each year. Associate contributions and the related interest vest immediately. Company contributions, along with related interest, are subject to vesting based on years of service. Associates may elect in-service distributions for the unmatched additional deferred compensation component only. The



remaining vested portion of associates’ accounts in the plan will be distributed upon termination of employment in either a lump sum or in annual installments over a specified period of up to


years.

The following table provides the Company’s annual activity for this plan and year-end liability, included in Other Long-term Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as of

21. Share-based Compensation

Plan Summary

In 2015, the Company's shareholders approved the 2015 Stock Option and Performance Incentive Plan ("2015 Plan"). The 2015 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance-based restricted stock, performance units and unrestricted shares. The Company grants stock options at a price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. Stock options have a maximum term of


years. Stock options generally vest ratably over

three

to

five

years. Restricted stock generally vests (the restrictions lapse) at the end of a

three

-year period or on a graded basis over a

five

-year period.

Under the Company’s plans,

160 million

options, restricted and unrestricted shares have been authorized to be granted to employees and directors. There were

9 million

options and shares available for grant as of

February 2, 2019

.

From time to time the Company's Board of Directors will declare special dividends. In accordance with the anti-dilutive provisions of the stock plan, in these circumstances the Company adjusts both the exercise price and the number of share-based awards outstanding as of the record date of the special dividends. The aggregate fair value, the aggregate intrinsic value and the ratio of the exercise price to the market price are approximately equal immediately before and after the adjustments. Therefore, no compensation expense is recognized.



Stock Options

The following table provides the Company’s stock option activity for the fiscal year ended

February 2, 2019

:

________________

(a)

The number of options expected to vest includes an estimate of expected forfeitures.

Intrinsic value for stock options is the difference between the current market value of the Company’s stock and the option strike price. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was

$2 million

for


,

$44 million

for


and

$30 million

for


.

The total fair value at grant date of option awards vested was

$9 million

for


and

$10 million

for


and


.

The Company’s total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested options was

$13 million

as of

February 2, 2019

. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

2.3

years.

The weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted was

$6.76

per share for


,

$5.96

per share for


and

$11.72

per share for


.

Cash received from stock options exercised was

$1 million

for


,

$38 million

for


and

$20 million

for


. Tax benefits realized from tax deductions associated with stock options exercised were less than

$1 million

for


,

$16 million

for


and

$9 million

for


.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for valuation of options granted to employees and directors. The Company’s determination of the fair value of options is affected by the Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.

The following table contains the weighted-average assumptions used during


,


and


:

The majority of the Company’s stock-based compensation awards are granted on an annual basis in the first quarter of each year. The expected volatility assumption is based on the Company’s analysis of historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon the average daily closing rates during the period for U.S. treasury notes that have a life which approximates the expected life of the option. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s history and expectation of dividend payouts in relation to the stock price at the grant date. The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding.



Restricted Stock

The following table provides the Company’s restricted stock activity for the fiscal year ended

February 2, 2019

:

The Company’s total intrinsic value of restricted stock vested was

$44 million

for


.

The Company’s total fair value at grant date of awards vested was

$86 million

for


,

$87 million

for


and

$68 million

for


. Fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the market value of an unrestricted share on the grant date adjusted for anticipated dividend yields.

As of

February 2, 2019

, there was

$108 million

of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested restricted stock. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

2.3

years.

The weighted-average estimated fair value of restricted stock granted was

$30.43

per share for


,

$39.21

per share for


and

$75.09

per share for

and


:

Share-based compensation expense is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest. The Company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and adjusts, if necessary, in subsequent periods based on historical experience and expected future termination rates.

The tax benefit associated with recognized share-based compensation expense was

for


,

$23 million

for


and
