ITEM 1.

Business.

Overview
    and Strategy

Atmos Energy Corporation, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is
    engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and
    transmission and storage businesses as well as other
    nonregulated natural gas businesses. Since our incorporation in
    Texas in 1983, we have grown primarily through a series of
    acquisitions, the most recent of which was the acquisition in
    October 2004 of the natural gas distribution and pipeline
    operations of TXU Gas Company. We are also incorporated in the
    state of Virginia.

Today, we distribute natural gas through regulated sales and
    transportation arrangements to over three million residential,
    commercial, public authority and industrial customers in
    12 states located primarily in the South, which makes us
    one of the country’s largest natural-gas-only distributors
    based on number of customers. We also operate one of the largest
    intrastate pipelines in Texas based on miles of pipe.

Through our nonregulated businesses, we primarily provide
    natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities,
    other local gas distribution companies and industrial customers
    principally in the Midwest and Southeast and natural gas
    transportation along with storage services to certain of our
    natural gas distribution divisions and third parties.

Our overall strategy is to:

•

deliver superior shareholder value,

•

improve the quality and consistency of earnings growth, while
    operating our regulated and nonregulated businesses
    exceptionally well and

•

enhance and strengthen a culture built on our core values.

We have continued to grow our earnings after giving effect to
    our acquisitions and have experienced more than 25 consecutive
    years of increasing dividends and earnings. Historically, we
    achieved this record of growth through acquisitions while
    efficiently managing our operating and maintenance expenses and
    leveraging our technology to achieve more efficient operations.
    In recent years, we have also achieved growth by implementing
    rate designs that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and
    separate the recovery of our approved margins from customer
    usage patterns. In addition, we have developed various
    commercial opportunities within our regulated transmission and
    storage operations.

Our core values include focusing on our employees and customers
    while conducting our business with honesty and integrity. We
    continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing
    communications with our employees and enhanced employee training.

Operating
    Segments

We operate the Company through the following four segments:

•

The

natural gas distribution segment

, which includes our
    regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations.

•

The

regulated transmission and storage segment

, which
    includes the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our
    Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division.

•

The

natural gas marketing segment

, which includes a
    variety of nonregulated natural gas management services.



•

The

pipeline, storage and other segment

, which is
    comprised of our nonregulated natural gas gathering,
    transmission and storage services.

These operating segments are described in greater detail below.

Natural
    Gas Distribution Segment Overview

Our natural gas distribution segment consists of the following
    six regulated divisions, presented in order of total rate base,
    covering service areas in 12 states:

•

Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division,

•

Atmos Energy Kentucky/Mid-States Division,

•

Atmos Energy Louisiana Division,

•

Atmos Energy West Texas Division,

•

Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division and

•

Atmos Energy Mississippi Division

Our natural gas distribution business is a seasonal business.
    Gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater
    during the winter months than during the remainder of the year.
    The volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with
    the temperatures during these months.

Revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory
    authorities in the states in which we operate. These rates are
    intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting
    business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital.
    Our primary service areas are located in Colorado, Kansas,
    Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. We have
    more limited service areas in Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri
    and Virginia. In addition, we transport natural gas for others
    through our distribution system.

Rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost
    adjustment mechanisms for costs that (i) are subject to
    significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs,
    (ii) represent a large component of our cost of service and
    (iii) are generally outside our control.

Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form
    of cost adjustment mechanism. Purchased gas cost adjustment
    mechanisms provide natural gas utility companies a method of
    recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without
    filing a rate case because they provide a

dollar-for-dollar

offset to increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas
    costs. Therefore, although substantially all of our natural gas
    distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas
    that we purchase, natural gas distribution gross profit (which
    is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost) is
    generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas.

Additionally, some jurisdictions have introduced
    performance-based ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives
    to natural gas utilities to minimize purchased gas costs through
    improved storage management and use of financial instruments to
    lock in gas costs. Under the performance-based ratemaking
    adjustment, purchased gas costs savings are shared between the
    utility and its customers.

Finally, regulatory authorities have approved weather
    normalization adjustments (WNA) for approximately
    94 percent of residential and commercial margins in our
    service areas as a part of our rates. WNA minimizes the effect
    of weather that is above or below normal by allowing us to
    increase customers’ bills to offset lower gas usage when
    weather is warmer than normal and decrease customers’ bills
    to offset higher gas usage when weather is colder than normal.



As of September 30, 2010 we had WNA for our residential and
    commercial meters in the following service areas for the
    following periods:

Georgia, Kansas, West Texas

October — May

Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Mid-Tex

November — April

Louisiana

December — March

Virginia

January — December

Our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers,
    including independent producers, marketers and pipeline
    companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted
    storage assets. Additionally, the natural gas supply for our
    Mid-Tex Division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements.

Supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply
    (peaking) quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a
    firm basis with various terms at market prices. Base load
    quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout
    the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to
    change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in
    requirements related to weather conditions.

Except for local production purchases, we select our natural gas
    suppliers through a competitive bidding process by requesting
    proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can
    provide reliable service. We select these suppliers based on
    their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm
    pipeline receipt points at the lowest cost. Major suppliers
    during fiscal 2010 were Anadarko Energy Services, BP Energy
    Company, Devon Gas Services, L.P., Enbridge Marketing (US) L.P.,
    Iberdrola Renewables, Inc., National Fuel Marketing Company,
    LLC, ONEOK Energy Services Company L.P., Tenaska Marketing,
    Texla Energy Management, Inc. and Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC,
    our natural gas marketing subsidiary.

The combination of base load, peaking and spot purchase
    agreements, coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage,
    allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather, which
    minimizes our need to enter into long-term firm commitments. We
    estimate our

peak-day

availability of natural gas supply to be approximately
    4.2 Bcf. The

peak-day

demand for our natural gas distribution operations in fiscal
    2010 was on January 8, 2010, when sales to customers
    reached approximately 4.0 Bcf.

Currently, all of our natural gas distribution divisions, except
    for our Mid-Tex Division, utilize 39 pipeline transportation
    companies, both interstate and intrastate, to transport our
    natural gas. The pipeline transportation agreements are firm and
    many of them have “pipeline no-notice” storage
    service, which provides for daily balancing between system
    requirements and nominated flowing supplies. These agreements
    have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while
    still maintaining our right of first refusal. The natural gas
    supply for our Mid-Tex Division is delivered solely by our Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division.

To maintain our deliveries to high priority customers, we have
    the ability, and have exercised our right, to curtail deliveries
    to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts
    or applicable state regulations or statutes. Our customers’
    demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our
    ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or
    immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the
    physical limitations of gathering, storage and transmission
    systems, the duration and severity of cold weather, the
    availability of gas reserves from our suppliers, the ability to
    purchase additional supplies on a short-term basis and actions
    by federal and state regulatory authorities. Curtailment rights
    provide us the flexibility to meet the human-needs requirements
    of our customers on a firm basis. Priority allocations imposed
    by federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as other
    factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to meet the
    demands of our customers. We anticipate no problems with
    obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers.

The following briefly describes our six natural gas distribution
    divisions. We operate in our service areas under terms of
    non-exclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities
    and towns that we serve. At September 30, 2010, we held
    1,115 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to
    35 years. A significant number of our franchises expire
    each year, which require renewal prior to the end of their
    terms. We believe that we will be able to renew our franchises
    as they expire. Additional information concerning our natural
    gas distribution divisions is presented under the caption
    “Operating Statistics”.



Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division.

Our Mid-Tex
    Division serves approximately 550 incorporated and
    unincorporated communities in the north-central, eastern and
    western parts of Texas, including the Dallas/Fort Worth
    Metroplex. The governing body of each municipality we serve has
    original jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates,
    operations and services within its city limits, except with
    respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel and
    agricultural use. The Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) has
    exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory
    orders and ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive
    original jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not
    located within the limits of a municipality.

Prior to fiscal 2008, this division operated under one
    system-wide rate structure. However, in 2008, we reached a
    settlement with cities representing approximately
    80 percent of this division’s customers (Settled
    Cities) that has allowed us, beginning in 2008, to update rates
    for customers in these cities through an annual rate review
    mechanism. Rates for the remaining 20 percent of this
    division’s customers, primarily the City of Dallas,
    continue to be updated through periodic formal rate proceedings
    and filings made under Texas’ Gas Reliability
    Infrastructure Program (GRIP). GRIP allows us to include in our
    rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior
    calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at
    least once every five years.

Atmos Energy Kentucky/Mid-States Division.

Our
    Kentucky/Mid-States Division operates in more than 420
    communities across Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri,
    Tennessee and Virginia. The service areas in these states are
    primarily rural; however, this division serves Franklin,
    Tennessee, and other suburban areas of Nashville. We update our
    rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings made
    with each state’s public service commission.

Atmos Energy Louisiana Division.

In Louisiana,
    we serve nearly 300 communities, including the suburban areas of
    New Orleans, the metropolitan area of Monroe and western
    Louisiana. Direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers
    in Louisiana, who use gas for fuel or in manufacturing
    processes, and sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel are exempt
    from regulation and are recognized in our natural gas marketing
    segment. Our rates in this division are updated annually through
    a rate stabilization clause filing without filing a formal rate
    case.

Atmos Energy West Texas Division.

Our West
    Texas Division serves approximately 80 communities in West
    Texas, including the Amarillo, Lubbock and Midland areas. Like
    our Mid-Tex Division, each municipality we serve has original
    jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates, operations and
    services within its city limits, with the RRC having exclusive
    appellate jurisdiction over the municipalities and exclusive
    original jurisdiction over rates and services provided to
    customers not located within the limits of a municipality. Prior
    to fiscal 2008, rates were updated in this division through
    formal rate proceedings. However, the West Texas Division
    entered into agreements with its West Texas service areas during
    2008 and its Amarillo and Lubbock service areas during 2009 to
    update rates for customers in these service areas through an
    annual rate review mechanism.

Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division.

Our
    Colorado-Kansas Division serves approximately
    170 communities throughout Colorado and Kansas and parts of
    Missouri, including the cities of Olathe, Kansas, a suburb of
    Kansas City and Greeley, Colorado, located near Denver. We
    update our rates in this division through periodic formal rate
    filings made with each state’s public service commission.



Atmos Energy Mississippi Division.

In
    Mississippi, we serve about 110 communities throughout the
    northern half of the state, including the Jackson metropolitan
    area. Our rates in the Mississippi Division are updated annually
    through a stable rate filing without filing a formal rate case.

Regulated
    Transmission and Storage Segment Overview

Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the
    regulated pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division. This division transports
    natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division, transports natural gas for
    third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in
    Texas. We also



provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry
    including parking arrangements, lending and sales of excess gas.
    Parking arrangements provide short-term interruptible storage of
    gas on our pipeline. Lending services provide short-term
    interruptible loans of natural gas from our pipeline to meet
    market demands. Gross profit earned from our Mid-Tex Division
    and through certain other transportation and storage services is
    subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the RRC. Rates are
    updated through periodic formal rate proceedings and filings
    made under Texas’ Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program
    (GRIP). GRIP allows us to include in our rate base annually
    approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year
    provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every
    five years. Atmos Pipeline — Texas’ existing
    regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage
    services to be provided under market-based rates with minimal
    regulation.

These operations include one of the largest intrastate pipeline
    operations in Texas with a heavy concentration in the
    established natural gas-producing areas of central, northern and
    eastern Texas, extending into or near the major producing areas
    of the Texas Gulf Coast and the Delaware and Val Verde Basins of
    West Texas. Nine basins located in Texas are believed to contain
    a substantial portion of the nation’s remaining onshore
    natural gas reserves. This pipeline system provides access to
    all of these basins.

Natural
    Gas Marketing Segment Overview

Our natural gas marketing activities are conducted through Atmos
    Energy Marketing (AEM), which is wholly-owned by Atmos Energy
    Holdings, Inc. (AEH). AEH is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEC
    and operates primarily in the Midwest and Southeast areas of the
    United States.

AEM’s primary business is to aggregate and purchase gas
    supply, arrange transportation and storage logistics and
    ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices. In
    addition, AEM utilizes proprietary and customer-owned
    transportation and storage assets to provide various services
    our customers request, including furnishing natural gas supplies
    at fixed and market-based prices, contract negotiation and
    administration, load forecasting, gas storage acquisition and
    management services, transportation services, peaking sales and
    balancing services, capacity utilization strategies and gas
    price hedging through the use of financial instruments. AEM
    serves most of its customers under contracts generally having
    one to two year terms and sells natural gas to some of its
    industrial customers on a delivered burner tip basis under
    contract terms ranging from 30 days to two years. As a
    result, AEM’s margins arise from the types of commercial
    transactions we have structured with our customers and our
    ability to identify the lowest cost alternative among the
    natural gas supplies, transportation and markets to which it has
    access to serve those customers.

AEM also seeks to maximize, through asset optimization
    activities, the economic value associated with the storage and
    transportation capacity we own or control in our natural gas
    distribution and natural gas marketing segments. We attempt to
    meet this objective by engaging in natural gas storage
    transactions in



which we seek to find and profit through the arbitrage of
    pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing
    pricing differences that occur over time. This process involves
    purchasing physical natural gas, storing it in the storage and
    transportation assets to which AEM has access and selling
    financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross
    profit margin.

Pipeline,
    Storage and Other Segment Overview

Our pipeline, storage and other segment primarily consists of
    the operations of Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC (APS), which
    is wholly-owned by AEH. APS is engaged in nonregulated
    transmission, storage and natural gas gathering services. Its
    primary asset is a proprietary 21 mile pipeline located in
    New Orleans, Louisiana. It also owns or controls additional
    pipeline and storage capacity including interests in underground
    storage fields in Kentucky and Louisiana that are used to reduce
    the need of our natural gas distribution divisions to contract
    for pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak
    periods.

APS’ primary business is to provide storage and
    transportation services to our Louisiana and Kentucky/Mid-States
    regulated natural gas distribution divisions, to our natural gas
    marketing segment and, on a more limited basis, to third
    parties. APS earns transportation fees and storage demand
    charges to aggregate and provide gas supply, provide access to
    storage capacity and transport gas for these customers.

APS also engages in various asset optimization activities.
    APS’ primary asset optimization activity involves the
    administration of two asset management plans with regulated
    affiliates of the Company. These arrangements provide APS the
    opportunity to maximize the economic value associated with the
    transportation and storage capacity assigned to these plans. APS
    attempts to meet this objective through a variety of activities
    including engaging in natural gas storage transactions and
    utilizing excess asset capacity to find and profit through the
    arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by
    recognizing pricing differences that occur over time. These
    plans require APS to share a portion of the economic value
    created by these activities with the regulated customers served
    by these affiliates. These arrangements have been approved by
    applicable state regulatory commissions and are subject to
    annual regulatory review intended to ensure proper allocation of
    economic value between our regulated customers and APS.

APS also seeks to maximize the economic value associated with
    the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls. We
    attempt to meet this objective by engaging in natural gas
    storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit through
    the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by
    recognizing pricing differences that occur over time. This
    process involves purchasing physical natural gas, storing it in
    the storage and transportation assets to which APS has access
    and, in transactions involving storage capacity, selling
    financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross
    profit margin.

Ratemaking
    Activity

Overview

The method of determining regulated rates varies among the
    states in which our natural gas distribution divisions operate.
    The regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring
    that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best
    interests of customers while providing utility companies the
    opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment.
    Generally, each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and
    establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue
    sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to
    provide a reasonable return on invested capital.

Our current rate strategy is to focus on reducing or eliminating
    regulatory lag, obtaining adequate returns and providing stable,
    predictable margins. Atmos Energy has annual ratemaking
    mechanisms in place in three states that provide for an annual
    rate review and adjustment to rates for approximately two-thirds
    of our gross margin. We also have accelerated recovery of only
    capital for approximately 20 percent of our gross margin.
    Combined, we have rate structures with accelerated recovery of
    all or a portion of our expenditures for over 80 percent of
    our gross margin. Additionally, we have WNA mechanisms in eight
    states that serve to minimize the effects of weather on
    approximately 94 percent of our gross margin. Finally, we
    have the ability to recover the gas cost portion of bad debts
    for approximately 70 percent of our gross margin. These
    mechanisms work in tandem to provide insulation from volatile
    margins, both for the Company and our customers.

We will also continue to address various rate design changes,
    including the recovery of bad debt gas costs and inclusion of
    other taxes in gas costs in future rate filings. These design
    changes would address cost variations that are related to
    pass-through energy costs beyond our control.

Although substantial progress has been made in recent years by
    improving rate design across Atmos’ operating areas,
    potential changes in federal energy policy and adverse economic
    conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the Company
    and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these
    external factors.



Recent
    Ratemaking Activity

Substantially all of our natural gas distribution revenues in
    the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008
    were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval
    by local or state authorities. Net operating income increases
    resulting from ratemaking activity totaling $56.8 million,
    $54.4 million and $40.6 million, became effective in
    fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 as summarized below:

    Settled Cities requesting an operating income increase of
    $56.8 million. A settlement was reached, effective
    October 1, 2010, which resolves all issues in the annual
    RRM filing and increases operating income by $23.1 million.
    Additionally, the settlement allows the Mid-Tex Division to
    expand its existing program to replace steel service lines which
    will replace approximately 100,000 steel service lines by
    September 30, 2012 at a total projected capital cost of
    $80-$120 million, utilizing an authorized return on equity
    of 9.0 percent, with the equity portion of the return based
    on the actual capital structure up to a maximum of
    50 percent.

Our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail
    below.



Rate
    Case Filings

A rate case is a formal request from Atmos Energy to a
    regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to
    customers. Rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory
    authorities request us to justify our rates. This process is
    referred to as a “show cause” action. Adequate rates
    are intended to provide for recovery of the Company’s costs
    as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure
    that we continue to deliver reliable, reasonably priced natural
    gas service to our customers. The following table summarizes our

Annual
    Rate Filing Mechanisms

As an instrument to reduce regulatory lag, annual rate filing
    mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on a periodic basis
    without filing a formal rate case. However, these filings still
    involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities
    prior to the final determination of rates under these
    mechanisms. As discussed above in “Natural Gas Distribution
    Segment Overview,” we currently have annual rate filing
    mechanisms in our Louisiana and Mississippi divisions and in
    significant portions of our Mid-Tex and West Texas divisions.
    These mechanisms are referred to as rate review mechanisms in
    our Mid-Tex and West Texas



divisions, stable rate filings in the Mississippi Division and
    rate stabilization clause in the Louisiana Division. The
    following table summarizes filings made under our various annual

In August 2010, we reached an agreement to extend the rate
    review mechanism in our Mid-Tex Division for an additional
    two-year period beginning October 1, 2010; however, the
    Mid-Tex Division will be required to file a general system-wide
    rate case on or before June 1, 2013. This extension
    provides for an annual rate adjustment to reflect changes in the
    Mid-Tex Division’s costs of service and additions to
    capital investment from year to year, without the necessity of
    filing a general rate case.

The settlement also allows us to expand our existing program to
    replace steel service lines in the Mid-Tex Division’s
    natural gas delivery system. On October 13, 2010, the City
    of Dallas approved the recovery of the return, depreciation and
    taxes associated with the replacement of 100,000 steel service
    lines across the Mid-Tex Division by September 30, 2012.
    The RRM in the Mid-Tex Division was entered into as a result of
    a settlement in the September 20, 2007 Statement of Intent
    case filed with all Mid-Tex Division cities. Of the 440
    incorporated cities served by the Mid-Tex Division, 439 of these
    cities are part of the rate review mechanism process.

The West Texas rate review mechanism was entered into in August
    2008 as a result of a settlement with the West Texas Coalition
    of Cities. The Lubbock and Amarillo rate review mechanisms were
    entered into in the spring of 2009. The West Texas Coalition of
    Cities agreed to extend its RRM for one additional cycle as part
    of the settlement of this year’s filing.

Other
    Regulation

Each of our natural gas distribution divisions is regulated by
    various state or local public utility authorities. We are also
    subject to regulation by the United States Department of
    Transportation with respect to safety requirements in the
    operation and maintenance of our gas distribution facilities. In
    addition, our distribution operations are also subject to
    various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters.
    From time to time we receive inquiries regarding various
    environmental matters. We believe that our properties and
    operations substantially comply with and are operated in
    substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental
    statutes and regulations. There are no administrative or
    judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality
    statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental
    agencies which would



have a material adverse effect on us or our operations. Our
    environmental claims have arisen primarily from former
    manufactured gas plant sites in Tennessee, Iowa and Missouri.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allows, pursuant
    to Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, gas
    transportation services through our Atmos Pipeline —
    Texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or
    local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines,
    without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the FERC.
    Additionally, the FERC has regulatory authority over the sale of
    natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release
    of interstate pipeline and storage capacity, as well as
    authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to
    enforce compliance with FERC’s other rules, policies and
    orders by companies engaged in the sale, purchase,
    transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce.
    We have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate
    steps to comply with these regulations.

We have been replacing certain steel service lines in our
    Mid-Tex Division since our acquisition of the natural gas
    distribution system in 2004. We currently have an existing RRM
    that should allow us to recover the replacement costs through
    the end of fiscal 2012. On September 10, 2010, the Texas
    Railroad Commission (RRC) published for comment a proposed
    regulation dealing with distribution facility replacement. The
    proposed regulation would require each gas distribution system
    operator to develop a risk-based program for the removal or
    replacement of distribution facilities, including steel service
    lines. A number of Texas operators, industry groups and facility
    component manufacturers filed comments. The RRC is presently
    reviewing the comments with action related to this proposal
    anticipated later this year or early next year. We are committed
    to replacing the steel service lines on an accelerated schedule
    to ensure the safety and reliability of our distribution system,
    and as part of this commitment, we support the objectives of
    proposed rulemaking by the RRC for steel service-line
    replacements statewide. Due to the preliminary status of the
    rulemaking process, we cannot accurately anticipate the impact
    the proposed regulation would have on the Company, if adopted,
    or the expected cost of the replacement program.

Competition

Although our natural gas distribution operations are not
    currently in significant direct competition with any other
    distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial
    customers within our service areas, we do compete with other
    natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for
    sales to industrial customers. We compete in all aspects of our
    business with alternative energy sources, including, in
    particular, electricity. Electric utilities offer electricity as
    a rival energy source and compete for the space heating, water
    heating and cooking markets. Promotional incentives, improved
    equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to
    the acceptability of electrical equipment. The principal means
    to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices, and
    natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in
    the residential, commercial and industrial markets. However,
    higher gas prices, coupled with the electric utilities’
    marketing efforts, have increased competition for residential
    and commercial customers.

Our regulated transmission and storage operations historically
    have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate
    pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange
    transportation, storage and other services for customers.
    However, in the last two years, several new pipelines have been
    completed, which has increased the level of competition in this
    segment of our business.

Within our nonregulated operations, AEM competes with other
    natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and
    other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring
    higher levels of balancing, scheduling and other related
    management services. AEM has experienced increased competition
    in recent years primarily from investment banks and major
    integrated oil and natural gas companies who offer lower cost,
    basic services. The increased competition has reduced margins
    most notably on its high-volume accounts.

Employees

At September 30, 2010, we had 4,913 employees,
    consisting of 4,776 employees in our regulated operations
    and 137 employees in our nonregulated operations.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

Our financial and operating results are subject to a number of
    risk factors, many of which are not within our control. Although
    we have tried to discuss key risk factors below, please be aware
    that other or new risks may prove to be important in the future.
    Investors should carefully consider the following discussion of
    risk factors as well as other information appearing in this
    report. These factors include the following:

Further
    disruptions in the credit markets could limit our ability to
    access capital and increase our costs of capital.

We rely upon access to both short-term and long-term credit
    markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements. The global credit
    markets have experienced significant disruptions and volatility
    during the last few years to a greater degree than has been seen
    in decades. In some cases, the ability or willingness of
    traditional sources of capital to provide financing has been
    reduced.

Historically, we have accessed the commercial paper markets to
    finance our short-term working capital needs. The disruptions in
    the credit markets during the fall of 2008 temporarily limited
    our access to the commercial paper markets and increased our
    borrowing costs. Consequently, for a short period, we were
    forced to borrow directly under our primary credit facility that
    backstops our commercial paper program to provide much of our
    working capital. This credit facility provides up to
    $567 million in committed financing through its expiration
    in December 2011. Our borrowings under this facility, along with
    our commercial paper, have been used primarily to purchase
    natural gas supplies for the upcoming winter heating season. The
    amount of our working capital requirements in the near-term will
    depend primarily on the market price of natural gas. Higher
    natural gas prices may adversely impact our accounts receivable
    collections and may require us to increase borrowings under our
    credit facilities to fund our operations. We have historically
    supplemented our commercial paper program with a short-term
    committed credit facility. No borrowings are currently



outstanding under our current $200 million short-term
    facility, which was scheduled to mature in October 2010. In
    October 2010, this facility was replaced with a
    $200 million

180-day

facility which expires in April 2011, on substantially the same
    terms.

Our long-term debt is currently rated as “investment
    grade” by Standard & Poor’s Corporation,
    Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. If
    adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation
    on our access to the private and public credit markets, we could
    see a reduction in our liquidity. A significant reduction in our
    liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings
    outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more
    of the three credit rating agencies. Such a downgrade could
    further limit our access to public

and/or

private credit markets and increase the costs of borrowing under
    each source of credit.

Further, if our credit ratings were downgraded, we could be
    required to provide additional liquidity to our natural gas
    marketing segment because the commodity financial instruments
    markets could become unavailable to us. Our natural gas
    marketing segment depends primarily upon a committed credit
    facility to finance its working capital needs, which it uses
    primarily to issue standby letters of credit to its natural gas
    suppliers. A significant reduction in the availability of this
    facility could require us to provide extra liquidity to support
    its operations or reduce some of the activities of our natural
    gas marketing segment. Our ability to provide extra liquidity is
    limited by the terms of our existing lending arrangements with
    AEH, which are subject to annual approval by one state
    regulatory commission.

While we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our
    operations and the sources of financing available to us, we can
    provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so
    in the future, especially if the market price of natural gas
    increases significantly in the near-term. The future effects on
    our business, liquidity and financial results of a further
    deterioration of current conditions in the credit markets could
    be material and adverse to us, both in the ways described above
    or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate.

The
    continuation of recent economic conditions could adversely
    affect our customers and negatively impact our financial
    results.

The slowdown in the U.S. economy, together with increased
    mortgage defaults and significant decreases in the values of
    homes and investment assets, has adversely affected the
    financial resources of many domestic households. It is unclear
    whether the administrative and legislative responses to these
    conditions will be successful in improving current economic
    conditions, including the lowering of current high unemployment
    rates across the U.S. As a result, our customers may seek
    to use even less gas and it may become more difficult for them
    to pay their gas bills. This may slow collections and lead to
    higher than normal levels of accounts receivable. This in turn
    could increase our financing requirements and bad debt expense.
    Additionally, our industrial customers may seek alternative
    energy sources, which could result in lower sales volumes.

The
    costs of providing pension and postretirement health care
    benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes
    in pension fund values, changing demographics and fluctuating
    actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse effect on
    our financial results. In addition, the passage of the Health
    Care Reform Act in 2010 could significantly increase the cost of
    the health care benefits for our employees.

We provide a cash-balance pension plan and postretirement
    healthcare benefits to eligible full-time employees. Our costs
    of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are
    subject to changes in the market value of the assets funding our
    pension and postretirement healthcare plans. The fluctuations
    over the last few years in the values of investments that fund
    our pension and postretirement healthcare plans may
    significantly differ from or alter the values and actuarial
    assumptions we use to calculate our future pension plan expense
    and postretirement healthcare costs and funding requirements
    under the Pension Protection Act. Any significant declines in
    the value of these investments could increase the expenses of
    our pension and postretirement healthcare plans and related
    funding requirements in the future. Our costs of providing such
    benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to
    changing demographics, including longer life



expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the
    number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten
    years, as well as various actuarial calculations and
    assumptions, which may differ materially from actual results due
    to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower
    withdrawal rates and interest rates and other factors.

In addition, the costs of providing health care benefits to our
    employees could significantly increase over the next five to ten
    years. Although the full effects of the legislation should not
    impact the Company until 2014, the future cost of compliance
    with the provisions of the Health Care Reform Act is difficult
    to measure at this time.

Our
    operations are exposed to market risks that are beyond our
    control which could adversely affect our financial results and
    capital requirements.

Our risk management operations are subject to market risks
    beyond our control, including market liquidity, commodity price
    volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics and
    counterparty creditworthiness. Although we maintain a risk
    management policy, we may not be able to completely offset the
    price risk associated with volatile gas prices, particularly in
    our nonregulated business segments, which could lead to
    volatility in our earnings.

Physical trading in our nonregulated business segments also
    introduces price risk on any net open positions at the end of
    each trading day, as well as volatility resulting from

intra-day

fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price
    movements between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for
    future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is
    hedged. The determination of our net open position as of the end
    of any particular trading day requires us to make assumptions as
    to future circumstances, including the use of gas by our
    customers in relation to our anticipated storage and market
    positions. Because the price risk associated with any net open
    position at the end of such day may increase if the assumptions
    are not realized, we review these assumptions as part of our
    daily monitoring activities. Although we manage our business to
    maintain no open positions, there are times when limited net
    open positions related to our physical storage may occur on a
    short-term basis. Net open positions may increase volatility in
    our financial condition or results of operations if market
    prices move in a significantly favorable or unfavorable manner
    before the open positions can be closed.

Further, the timing of the recognition for financial accounting
    purposes of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair
    value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges
    usually does not match the timing of the economic profits or
    losses on the item being hedged. This volatility may occur with
    a resulting increase or decrease in earnings or losses, even
    though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from
    the date the transactions were consummated. Also, if the local
    physical markets in which we trade do not move consistently with
    the NYMEX futures market upon which most of our commodity
    derivative financial instruments are valued, we could experience
    increased volatility in the financial results of our natural gas
    marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments.

Our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other
    segments manage margins and limit risk exposure on the sale of
    natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixed-price purchase or
    sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through
    the use of a variety of financial instruments. However,
    contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to
    withdraw gas from storage, which could cause us to purchase gas
    at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes
    to fulfill customer contracts. We could also realize financial
    losses on our efforts to limit risk as a result of volatility in
    the market prices of the underlying commodities or if a
    counterparty fails to perform under a contract. Any significant
    tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our
    counterparties to fail to perform than expected. In addition,
    adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties
    could limit the level of trading activities with these parties
    and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a
    contract. These circumstances could also increase our capital
    requirements.

We are also subject to interest rate risk on our borrowings. In
    recent years, we have been operating in a relatively low
    interest-rate environment compared to historical norms for both
    short and long-term interest rates. However, increases in
    interest rates could adversely affect our future financial
    results.



We are
    subject to state and local regulations that affect our
    operations and financial results.

Our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and
    storage segments are subject to various regulated returns on our
    rate base in each jurisdiction in which we operate. We monitor
    the allowed rates of return and our effectiveness in earning
    such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating changes as
    we believe are needed. In addition, in the normal course of
    business in the regulatory environment, assets may be placed in
    service and historical test periods established before rate
    cases can be filed that could result in an adjustment of our
    allowed returns. Once rate cases are filed, regulatory bodies
    have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates
    while studying the cases. Because of this process, we must
    suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in
    service without the benefit of rate relief, which is commonly
    referred to as “regulatory lag.” Rate cases also
    involve a risk of rate reduction, because once rates have been
    approved, they are still subject to challenge for their
    reasonableness by appropriate regulatory authorities. In
    addition, regulators may review our purchases of natural gas and
    can adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to
    our customers. Finally, our debt and equity financings are also
    subject to approval by regulatory commissions in several states,
    which could limit our ability to access or take advantage of
    changes in the capital markets.

We may
    experience increased federal, state and local regulation of the
    safety of our operations.

We are committed to constantly monitoring and maintaining our
    pipeline and distribution system to ensure that natural gas is
    delivered safely, reliably and efficiently through our network
    of more than 77,000 miles of pipeline and distribution
    lines. The steel service line replacement program currently
    underway in our Mid-Tex Division typifies the preventive
    maintenance and continual renewal that we perform on our natural
    gas distribution system in all 12 states in which we
    operate. The safety and protection of the public, our customers
    and our employees is our top priority. However, due primarily to
    the recent unfortunate pipeline incident in California, we
    anticipate companies in the natural gas distribution business
    may be subjected to even greater federal, state and local
    oversight of the safety of their operations in the future.
    Accordingly, the costs of complying with such increased
    regulations may have at least a short-term adverse impact on our
    operating costs and financial results.

Some
    of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory
    oversight that could affect our operations and financial
    results.

FERC has regulatory authority that affects some of our
    operations, including sales of natural gas in the wholesale gas
    market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and
    storage capacity. Under legislation passed by Congress in 2005,
    FERC has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse
    and market manipulation and to promote compliance with
    FERC’s other rules, policies and orders by companies
    engaged in the sale, purchase, transportation or storage of
    natural gas in interstate commerce. These rules carry increased
    penalties for violations. We are currently under investigation
    by FERC for possible violations of its posting and competitive
    bidding regulations for pre-arranged released firm capacity on
    interstate natural gas pipelines. Should FERC conclude that we
    have committed such violations of its regulations and levies
    substantial fines

and/or

penalties against us, our business, financial condition or
    financial results could be adversely affected. In addition,
    although we have taken steps to structure current and future
    transactions to comply with applicable current FERC regulations,
    changes in FERC regulations or their interpretation by FERC or
    additional regulations issued by FERC in the future could also
    adversely affect our business, financial condition or financial
    results.

We are
    subject to environmental regulations which could adversely
    affect our operations or financial results.

We are subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements
    enacted or adopted by federal, state and local governmental
    authorities relating to protection of the environment and health
    and safety matters, including those legal requirements that
    govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the
    management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, the

clean-up

of
    contaminated sites, groundwater quality and availability, plant
    and wildlife protection, as well as work practices related to
    employee health and safety.



Environmental legislation also requires that our facilities,
    sites and other properties associated with our operations be
    operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the
    satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. Failure to
    comply with these laws, regulations, permits and licenses may
    expose us to fines, penalties or interruptions in our operations
    that could be significant to our financial results. In addition,
    existing environmental regulations may be revised or our
    operations may become subject to new regulations.

Our
    business may be subject in the future to additional regulatory
    and financial risks associated with global warming and climate
    change.

There have been a number of new federal and state legislative
    and regulatory initiatives proposed in an attempt to control or
    limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change,
    including greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide. For
    example, in June 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives
    approved

The American Clean Energy and Security Act of

, also known as the Waxman-Markey bill or “cap and
    trade” bill. However, neither this bill nor a related bill
    in the U.S. Senate, the Clean Energy and Emissions Power
    Act was passed by Congress. The adoption of this type of
    legislation by Congress or similar legislation by states or the
    adoption of related regulations by federal or state governments
    mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in
    the future could have far-reaching and significant impacts on
    the energy industry. Such new legislation or regulations could
    result in increased compliance costs for us or additional
    operating restrictions on our business, affect the demand for
    natural gas or impact the prices we charge to our customers. At
    this time, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws
    or regulations that may be adopted on our future business,
    financial condition or financial results.

The
    concentration of our distribution, pipeline and storage
    operations in the State of Texas exposes our operations and
    financial results to economic conditions and regulatory
    decisions in Texas.

Over 50 percent of our natural gas distribution customers
    and most of our pipeline and storage assets and operations are
    located in the State of Texas. This concentration of our
    business in Texas means that our operations and financial
    results may be significantly affected by changes in the Texas
    economy in general and regulatory decisions by state and local
    regulatory authorities in Texas.

Adverse
    weather conditions could affect our operations or financial
    results.

Since the

2006-2007

winter heating season, we have had weather-normalized rates for
    over 90 percent of our residential and commercial meters,
    which has substantially mitigated the adverse effects of

warmer-than-normal

weather for meters in those service areas. However, there is no
    assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory
    protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future. The
    loss of such weather — normalized rates could have an
    adverse effect on our operations and financial results. In
    addition, our natural gas distribution and regulated
    transmission and storage operating results may continue to vary
    somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating
    season. Sustained cold weather could adversely affect our
    natural gas marketing operations as we may be required to
    purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain
    sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts.

Inflation
    and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base
    and customer collections and increase our level of
    indebtedness.

Inflation has caused increases in some of our operating expenses
    and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs. We have
    a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our
    natural gas distribution gas rates in relation to the increasing
    cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in
    adjusting those gas rates. Historically, we have been able to
    budget and control operating expenses and investments within the
    amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to
    continue to do so. However, the ability to control expenses is
    an important factor that could impact future financial results.

Rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to
    experience a significant increase in short-term debt. We must
    pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased, which can be
    significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered
    through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas
    delivered. Increases in



purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution
    collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the
    payment of their gas bills, leading to higher than normal
    accounts receivable. This could result in higher short-term debt
    levels, greater collection efforts and increased bad debt
    expense.

Our
    growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our
    business, which requires extensive capital
    spending.

We must continually build additional capacity in our natural gas
    distribution system to enable us to serve any growth in the
    number of our customers. The cost of adding this capacity may be
    affected by a number of factors, including the general state of
    the economy and weather. In addition, although we should
    ultimately recover the cost of the expenditures through rates,
    we must make significant capital expenditures during the next
    two fiscal years in executing our steel service line replacement
    program in the Mid-Tex Division. Our cash flows from operations
    generally are sufficient to supply funding for all our capital
    expenditures, including the financing of the costs of new
    construction along with capital expenditures necessary to
    maintain our existing natural gas system. Due to the timing of
    these cash flows and capital expenditures, we often must fund at
    least a portion of these costs through borrowing funds from
    third party lenders, the cost and availability of which is
    dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets, interest rates
    and other market conditions. This in turn may limit our ability
    to connect new customers to our system due to constraints on the
    amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure.

Our
    operations are subject to increased competition.

In residential and commercial customer markets, our natural gas
    distribution operations compete with other energy products, such
    as electricity and propane. Our primary product competition is
    with electricity for heating, water heating and cooking.
    Increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact
    our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of
    natural gas to the consumer. This could adversely impact our
    business if, as a result, our customer growth slows, reducing
    our ability to make capital expenditures, or if our customers
    further conserve their use of gas, resulting in reduced gas
    purchases and customer billings.

In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing
    plants, adverse economic conditions, including higher gas costs,
    could cause these customers to use alternative sources of
    energy, such as electricity, or bypass our systems in favor of
    special competitive contracts with lower

per-unit

costs. Our regulated transmission and storage operations
    historically have faced limited competition from other existing
    intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or
    arrange transportation, storage and other services for
    customers. However, in the last two years, several new pipelines
    have been completed, which has increased the level of
    competition in this segment of our business. Within our
    nonregulated operations, AEM competes with other natural gas
    marketers to provide natural gas management and other related
    services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels
    of balancing, scheduling and other related management services.
    AEM has experienced increased competition in recent years
    primarily from investment banks and major integrated oil and
    natural gas companies who offer lower cost, basic services.

Distributing
    and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in
    accidents and additional operating costs.

Our natural gas distribution business involves a number of
    hazards and operating risks that cannot be completely avoided,
    such as leaks, accidents and operational problems, which could
    cause loss of human life, as well as substantial financial
    losses resulting from property damage, damage to the environment
    and to our operations. We do have liability and property
    insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks.
    However, because our pipeline, storage and distribution
    facilities are near or are in populated areas, any loss of human
    life or adverse financial results resulting from such events
    could be large. If these events were not fully covered by
    insurance, our operations or financial results could be
    adversely affected.



Natural
    disasters, terrorist activities or other significant events
    could adversely affect our operations or financial
    results.

Natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and
    operations. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities
    could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in
    the price of natural gas that could affect our operations. Also,
    companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure
    to actual acts of terrorism, which could subject our operations
    to increased risks. As a result, the availability of insurance
    covering such risks may be more limited, which could increase
    the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or
    financial results.

Properties.

Distribution,
    transmission and related assets

At September 30, 2010, our natural gas distribution segment
    owned an aggregate of 71,120 miles of underground
    distribution and transmission mains throughout our gas
    distribution systems. These mains are located on easements or

rights-of-way

which generally provide for perpetual use. We maintain our mains
    through a program of continuous inspection and repair and
    believe that our system of mains is in good condition. Our
    regulated transmission and storage segment owned
    5,924 miles of gas transmission and gathering lines and our
    pipeline, storage and other segment owned 113 miles of gas
    transmission and gathering lines.

Storage
    Assets

We own underground gas storage facilities in several states to
    supplement the supply of natural gas in periods of peak demand.

ITEM 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

INTRODUCTION

This section provides management’s discussion of the
    financial condition, changes in financial condition and results
    of operations of Atmos Energy Corporation and its consolidated
    subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations
    and liquidity and capital resources. It includes
    management’s interpretation of our financial results, the
    factors affecting these results, the major factors expected to
    affect future operating results and future investment and
    financing plans. This discussion should be read in conjunction
    with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

Several factors exist that could influence our future financial
    performance, some of which are described in Item 1A above,
    “Risk Factors”. They should be considered in
    connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained
    in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since
    these factors could cause actual results and conditions to
    differ materially from those set out in such forward-looking
    statements.

Cautionary
    Statement for the Purposes of the Safe Harbor under the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

The statements contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

may contain “forward-looking statements” within the
    meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All
    statements other than statements of historical fact included in
    this Report are forward-looking statements made in good faith by
    us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from
    liability established by the Private Securities Litigation
    Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, or any other of
    our documents or oral presentations, the words
    “anticipate”, “believe”,
    “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”,
    “goal”, “intend”, “objective”,
    “plan”, “projection”, “seek”,
    “strategy” or similar words are intended to identify
    forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are
    subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
    results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in
    the statements relating to our strategy, operations, markets,
    services, rates, recovery of costs, availability of gas supply
    and other factors. These risks and uncertainties include the
    following: our ability to continue to access the credit markets
    to satisfy our liquidity requirements; the impact of adverse
    economic conditions on our customers; increased costs of
    providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and
    increased funding requirements along with increased costs of
    health care benefits; market risks beyond our control affecting
    our risk management activities including market liquidity,
    commodity price volatility, increasing interest rates and
    counterparty creditworthiness; regulatory trends and decisions,
    including the impact of rate proceedings before various state
    regulatory commissions; possible increased federal, state and
    local regulation of the safety of our operations; increased
    federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties; the impact
    of environmental regulations on our business; the impact of
    possible future additional regulatory and financial risks
    associated with global warming and climate change on our
    business; the concentration of our distribution, pipeline and
    storage operations in Texas; adverse weather conditions; the
    effects of inflation and changes in the availability and price
    of natural gas; the capital-intensive nature of our gas
    distribution business; increased competition from energy
    suppliers and alternative forms of energy; the inherent hazards
    and risks involved in operating our gas distribution business,
    natural disasters, terrorist activities or other events, and
    other risks and uncertainties discussed herein, especially those
    discussed in Item 1A above, all of which are difficult to
    predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly,
    while we believe these forward-looking statements to be
    reasonable, there can be no assurance that they will approximate
    actual experience or that the expectations derived from them
    will be realized. Further, we undertake no obligation to update
    or revise any of our forward-looking statements whether as a
    result of new information, future events or otherwise.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States. Preparation of these financial statements
    requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
    and the related disclosures of contingent assets and
    liabilities. We based our estimates on historical experience and
    various



other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
    circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates,
    including those related to risk management and trading
    activities, fair value measurements, allowance for doubtful
    accounts, legal and environmental accruals, insurance accruals,
    pension and postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes
    and valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets
    and other long-lived assets. Our critical accounting policies
    are reviewed by the Audit Committee quarterly. Actual results
    may differ from estimates.

Regulation

— Our natural gas distribution and
    regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to
    regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of
    accounting records and various other matters by the respective
    regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. We
    meet the criteria established within accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of a cost-based,
    rate-regulated entity, which requires us to reflect the
    financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and
    policies of the various regulatory commissions in our financial
    statements in accordance with applicable authoritative
    accounting standards. We apply the provisions of this standard
    to our regulated operations and record regulatory assets for
    costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through
    customer rates is considered probable and regulatory liabilities
    when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts
    that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking
    process. As a result, certain costs that would normally be
    expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the
    balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered
    through rates. Discontinuing the application of this method of
    accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could
    significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs
    would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet,
    which could reduce our net income. Further, regulation may
    impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized.
    The amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon
    historical experience and our understanding of the regulations.
    The impact of regulation on our regulated operations may be
    affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the
    issuance of new regulations.

Revenue recognition

— Sales of natural gas to
    our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly
    basis; however, the billing cycle periods for certain classes of
    customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods
    used for financial reporting purposes. We follow the revenue
    accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution
    segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to
    customers, but not yet billed under the cycle billing method,
    are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to
    expense.

On occasion, we are permitted to implement new rates that have
    not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities, which
    are subject to refund. We recognize this revenue and establish a
    reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our
    experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were
    implemented.

Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for
    increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through
    purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas cost
    adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of
    recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without
    filing a rate case to address all of the utility company’s
    non-gas costs. These mechanisms are commonly utilized when
    regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of cost, such
    as purchased gas costs, that (i) is subject to significant
    price fluctuations compared to the utility company’s other
    costs, (ii) represents a large component of the utility
    company’s cost of service and (iii) is generally
    outside the control of the gas utility company. There is no
    gross profit generated through purchased gas cost adjustments,
    but they provide a

dollar-for-dollar

offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs. Although
    substantially all natural gas distribution sales to our
    customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase, our
    gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the
    cost of gas as a result of the purchased gas cost adjustment
    mechanism. The effects of these purchased gas cost adjustment
    mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance
    sheet.

Operating revenues for our regulated transmission and storage
    and pipeline, storage and other segments are recognized in the
    period in which actual volumes are transported and storage
    services are provided.

Operating revenues for our natural gas marketing segment and the
    associated carrying value of natural gas inventory (inclusive of
    storage costs) are recognized when we sell the gas and
    physically deliver it to our



customers. Operating revenues include realized gains and losses
    arising from the settlement of financial instruments used in our
    natural gas marketing activities and unrealized gains and losses
    arising from changes in the fair value of natural gas inventory
    designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge and the
    associated financial instruments.

Allowance for doubtful accounts

— Accounts
    receivable arise from natural gas sales to residential,
    commercial, industrial, municipal and other customers. For the
    majority of our receivables, we establish an allowance for
    doubtful accounts based on our collections experience. On
    certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific
    customer’s inability or reluctance to pay, we record an
    allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce
    the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to
    collect. However, if circumstances change, our estimate of the
    recoverability of accounts receivable could be affected.
    Circumstances which could affect our estimates include, but are
    not limited to, customer credit issues, the level of natural gas
    prices, customer deposits and general economic conditions.
    Accounts are written off once they are deemed to be
    uncollectible.

Financial instruments and hedging activities

— We currently use financial instruments to
    mitigate commodity price risk. Additionally, we periodically use
    financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. The
    objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have
    been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and
    nonregulated businesses.

We record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet
    at fair value as required by accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States

,

with changes in fair value
    ultimately recorded in the income statement. The timing of when
    changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recorded
    in the income statement depends on whether the financial
    instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a
    hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a
    different accounting treatment. Changes in fair value for
    financial instruments that do not meet one of these criteria are
    recognized in the income statement as they occur.

Financial
    Instruments Associated with Commodity Price Risk

In our natural gas distribution segment, our customers are
    exposed to the effect of volatile natural gas prices. We manage
    this exposure through a combination of physical storage,
    fixed-price forward contracts and financial instruments,
    primarily

over-the-counter

swap and option contracts, in an effort to minimize the impact
    of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the
    winter heating season. The costs associated with and the gains
    and losses arising from the use of financial instruments to
    mitigate commodity price risk in this segment are included in
    our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms in accordance with
    regulatory requirements. Therefore, changes in the fair value of
    these financial instruments are initially recorded as a
    component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the
    consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas
    cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and
    recognized in revenue in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, there is
    no earnings impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a
    result of the use of financial instruments.

Our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas
    supply, arranges transportation

and/or

storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers
    at competitive prices. We also perform asset optimization
    activities in both our natural gas marketing segment and
    pipeline, storage and other segment. As a result of these
    activities, our nonregulated operations are exposed to risks
    associated with changes in the market price of natural gas. We
    manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes
    through a combination of physical storage and financial
    instruments, including futures,

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with
    counterparties.

In our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other
    segments, we have designated the natural gas inventory held by
    these operating segments as the hedged item in a fair-value
    hedge. This inventory is marked to market at the end of each
    month based on the Gas Daily index, with changes in fair value
    recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the
    period of change. The financial instruments associated with this
    natural gas inventory have been designated as fair-value hedges
    and are marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price
    with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or
    losses in revenue in the period of change. Changes in the
    spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the
    financial



instruments designated against our physical inventory (NYMEX)
    and the market (spot) prices used to value our physical storage
    (Gas Daily) result in unrealized margins until the underlying
    physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments
    are settled. The difference in the spot price used to value our
    physical inventory and the forward price used to value the
    related financial instruments can result in volatility in our
    reported income as a component of unrealized margins. We have
    elected to exclude this spot/forward differential for purposes
    of assessing the effectiveness of these fair-value hedges. Once
    the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled,
    the previously unrealized margins associated with these net
    positions are realized. Over time, we expect gains and losses on
    the sale of storage gas inventory to be offset by gains and
    losses on the fair-value hedges, resulting in the realization of
    the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we
    structured the original transaction.

We have elected to treat fixed-price forward contracts used in
    our natural gas marketing segment to deliver gas as normal
    purchases and normal sales. As such, these deliveries are
    recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with our revenue
    recognition policy. Financial instruments used to mitigate the
    commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been
    designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and
    sales at indexed prices. Accordingly, unrealized gains and
    losses on open financial instruments are recorded as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in
    earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are
    sold. Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred, is reported
    as a component of revenue.

We also use storage swaps and futures to capture additional
    storage arbitrage opportunities in our natural gas marketing
    segment that arise after the execution of the original fair
    value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory,
    basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our
    fixed price and storage books and various

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options. These financial instruments have
    not been designated as hedges.

Financial
    Instruments Associated with Interest Rate Risk

We periodically manage interest rate risk, typically when we
    issue new or refinance existing long-term debt with Treasury
    lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the
    interest cost associated with anticipated financings. We
    designate these Treasury lock agreements as a cash flow hedge of
    an anticipated transaction at the time the agreements are
    executed. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses associated
    with the Treasury lock agreements were recorded as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The realized
    gain or loss recognized upon settlement of each Treasury lock
    agreement was initially recorded as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss) and is recognized as a
    component of interest expense over the life of the related
    financing arrangement.

Impairment assessments

— We perform impairment
    assessments of our goodwill, intangible assets subject to
    amortization and long-lived assets. As of September 30,
    2010, we had no indefinite-lived intangible assets.

We annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during
    our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise. We
    use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to
    estimate the fair value of our reporting units. We have
    determined our reporting units to be each of our natural gas
    distribution divisions and wholly-owned subsidiaries and
    goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the
    acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill. The discounted cash
    flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are
    dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of
    future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rate. An
    impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a
    reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value.

We annually assess whether the cost of our intangible assets
    subject to amortization or other long-lived assets is
    recoverable or that the remaining useful lives may warrant
    revision. We perform this assessment more frequently when
    specific events or circumstances have occurred that suggest the
    recoverability of the cost of the intangible and other
    long-lived assets is at risk.

When such events or circumstances are present, we assess the
    recoverability of these assets by determining whether the
    carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash
    flows from the



operating division or subsidiary to which these assets relate.
    These cash flow projections consider various factors such as the
    timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are
    based upon the best information available at the time the
    estimate is made. Changes in these factors could materially
    affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition
    of an impairment charge. An impairment charge is recognized as
    the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if
    the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying
    value of the related asset.

Pension and other postretirement plans

—
    Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are
    determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous
    assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan
    assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed
    discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality
    data. Prior to fiscal 2009, we reviewed the estimates and
    assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan
    costs and liabilities annually based upon a June 30 measurement
    date. Effective October 1, 2008, we changed our measurement
    date to September 30. The assumed discount rate and the
    expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most
    significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities. The
    assumed discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate
    and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most
    significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and
    liabilities.

The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the
    actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement
    obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement benefit
    plan costs. When establishing our discount rate, we consider
    high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in
    the marketplace that are suitable for settling the obligations,
    changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied
    discount rate that is derived from matching our projected
    benefit disbursements with currently available high quality
    corporate bonds.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in
    calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our
    annual pension and postretirement plan costs. We estimate the
    expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond
    returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of
    active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset
    rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the
    guidance from our investment advisors in making a final
    determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the
    extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the
    course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate,
    that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan costs are
    not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases
    future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of
    approximately ten to twelve years.

The market-related value of our plan assets represents the fair
    market value of the plan assets, adjusted to smooth out
    short-term market fluctuations over a five-year period. The use
    of this calculation will delay the impact of current market
    fluctuations on the pension expense for the period.

We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in
    determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual
    health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted
    legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of
    retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our
    participant census information as of the measurement date.

Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and
    differences between the actual return on plan assets and the
    expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on
    the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized. A
    0.25 percent change in our discount rate would impact our
    pension and postretirement costs by approximately
    $1.9 million. A 0.25 percent change in our expected
    rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs
    by approximately $0.9 million.

Fair Value Measurements

— We report certain
    assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the
    price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
    transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants at the measurement date (exit price). We primarily
    use quoted market prices and other observable market pricing
    information in valuing our financial assets and liabilities and
    minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our
    measurements.



Prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to
    determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities
    recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. Within our
    nonregulated operations, we utilize a mid-market pricing
    convention (the mid-point between the bid and ask prices) as a
    practical expedient for determining fair value measurement, as
    permitted under current accounting standards. Values derived
    from these sources reflect the market in which transactions
    involving these financial instruments are executed. We utilize
    models and other valuation methods to determine fair value when
    external sources are not available. Values are adjusted to
    reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our
    positions over a reasonable period of time under then-current
    market conditions. We believe the market prices and models used
    to value these assets and liabilities represent the best
    information available with respect to closing exchange and

over-the-counter

quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the
    assets and liabilities.

Fair-value estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and
    the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved. Our
    counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and
    major energy companies. This concentration of counterparties may
    materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from
    market, economic or regulatory conditions. Adverse developments
    in the global financial and credit markets in the last few years
    have made it more difficult and more expensive for companies to
    access the short-term capital markets, which may negatively
    impact the creditworthiness of our counterparties. A further
    tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our
    counterparties to fail to perform. We seek to minimize
    counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their
    financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral
    requirements under certain circumstances.

Amounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially
    significant volatility based upon changes in market prices, the
    valuation of the portfolio of our contracts, maturity and
    settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions,
    each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our
    financial instruments. We believe the market prices and models
    used to value these financial instruments represent the best
    information available with respect to closing exchange and

over-the-counter

quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the
    contracts. Values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact
    of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable
    period of time under then current market conditions.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

Overview

Atmos Energy Corporation is involved in the distribution,
    marketing and transportation of natural gas. Accordingly, our
    results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural
    gas, particularly during the winter heating season, and the
    volatility of the natural gas markets. This generally results in
    higher operating revenues and net income during the period from
    October through March of each fiscal year and lower operating
    revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the
    period from April through September of each fiscal year. As a
    result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry, our
    second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical
    earnings quarter with an average of approximately
    61 percent of our consolidated net income having been
    earned in the second quarter during the three most recently
    completed fiscal years.

Additionally, the seasonality of our business impacts our
    working capital differently at various times during the year.
    Typically, our accounts receivable, accounts payable and
    short-term debt balances peak by the end of January and then
    start to decline, as customers begin to pay their winter heating
    bills. Gas stored underground, particularly in our natural gas
    distribution segment, typically peaks in November and declines
    as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers.

During the current year,

colder-than-normal

weather and recent improvements in rate designs in our natural
    gas distribution segment partially offset the decline in demand
    for natural gas, which contributed to a 19 percent

year-over-year

decrease in consolidated throughput in our regulated
    transmission and storage segment and a 5 percent

year-over-year

decrease in consolidated sales volumes in our natural gas
    marketing segment.



During the year, we continued to successfully access the capital
    markets and received updated debt ratings from three rating
    agencies. In December 2009 we renewed a $450 million

364-day

committed credit facility for our nonregulated operations. In
    March 2010, Moody’s upgraded our rating outlook from stable
    to positive and affirmed the existing credit rating on our
    senior long-term debt and commercial paper while S&P
    affirmed our rating outlook as stable and our senior long-term
    debt credit rating. In June 2010, Fitch upgraded our rating
    outlook from stable to positive and affirmed the existing credit
    rating on our senior unsecured debt and commercial paper. In
    October 2010, we replaced our $200 million

364-day

revolving credit agreement prior to its expiration with a
    $200 million

180-day

revolving credit agreement. The new credit facilities should
    help ensure we have sufficient liquidity to fund our working
    capital needs, while our credit ratings should help us continue
    to obtain financing at a reasonable cost in the future.

On July 1, 2010, we entered into an accelerated share
    repurchase program with Goldman Sachs & Co. as part of
    our ongoing efforts to improve shareholder value. The shares
    that will be repurchased under this program should offset the
    dilutive impact of stock grants made under our various employee
    and director incentive compensation plans. The impact of the
    shares repurchased under the program during fiscal 2010
    increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.01.

Historically, our regulated operations arising from our natural
    gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage
    operations contributed 65 to 85 percent of our consolidated
    net income. Regulated operations contributed 81 percent,
    83 percent and 74 percent to our consolidated net
    income for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008. Our consolidated
    net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across

Net income during fiscal 2010 increased eight percent over
    fiscal 2009. Net income from our regulated operations increased
    six percent during fiscal 2010. The increase primarily reflects
    colder than normal weather in most of our service areas as well
    as the net favorable impact of various ratemaking activities in
    our natural gas distribution segment. Net income in our
    nonregulated operations increased $5.3 million during
    fiscal 2010 primarily due to the impact of unrealized margins.
    Non-cash, net unrealized margins totaled $4.3 million which
    reduced earnings per share by $0.05 per diluted share compared
    to the prior year, when net unrealized losses totaled
    $21.6 million, which reduced earnings per share by $0.23
    per diluted share.

Net income in both periods was impacted by nonrecurring items.
    The current year period includes the positive impact of a state
    sales tax refund of $4.6 million, or $0.05 per diluted
    share. Net income in the prior-year period included the net
    positive impact of several one-time items totaling
    $17.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share related to the
    following pre-tax amounts:

•

$11.3 million related to a favorable one-time tax benefit.

•

$7.6 million related to the favorable impact of an update
    to the estimate for unbilled accounts.

•

$7.0 million favorable impact of the reversal of estimated
    uncollectible gas costs.

•

$5.4 million unfavorable impact of a non-cash impairment
    charge related to

available-for-sale

securities in our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.

Net income during fiscal 2009 increased six percent over fiscal
    2008, driven largely from an 18 percent increase in net
    income from regulated operations during fiscal 2009. The
    increase primarily reflects a $32.3 million increase in
    gross profit resulting from the net favorable impact of various
    ratemaking activities in our natural gas distribution segment,
    partially offset by higher depreciation expense, pipeline
    maintenance costs and interest expense. Net income in our
    nonregulated operations decreased $13.1 million primarily
    due to the impact of unrealized margins. Pre-tax unrealized
    margins totaled $35.9 million which reduced earnings per
    share by $0.23 per diluted share. The overall increase in
    consolidated net income was also favorably affected by
    non-recurring items totaling $17.1 million, or $0.19 per
    diluted share, related to the items noted above.

See the following discussion regarding the results of operations
    for each of our business operating segments.

Natural
    Gas Distribution Segment

The primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas
    distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized
    rates of return, the cost of natural gas, competitive factors in
    the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas.

Our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on
    our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking
    jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and,
    ultimately, separating the recovery of our approved margins from
    customer usage patterns. Improving rate design is a long-term
    process



and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in
    multiple rate jurisdictions. The “Ratemaking Activity”
    section of this

Form 10-K

describes our current rate strategy, progress towards
    implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in
    more detail.

We are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our
    customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment
    mechanisms; therefore the cost of gas typically does not have an
    impact on our gross profit as increases in the cost of gas are
    offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. Accordingly, we
    believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial
    performance than revenues. However, gross profit in our Texas
    and Mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross
    receipts taxes, which are calculated as a percentage of revenue
    (inclusive of gas costs). Therefore, the amount of these taxes
    included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the
    level of gas sales volumes. We record the tax expense as a
    component of taxes, other than income. Although changes in
    revenue-related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect
    gross profit, over time the impact is offset within operating
    income. Prior to January 1, 2009, timing differences
    existed between the recognition of revenue for franchise fees
    collected from our customers and the recognition of expense of
    franchise taxes. These timing differences had a significant
    temporary effect on operating income in periods with volatile
    gas prices, particularly in our Mid-Tex Division. Beginning
    January 1, 2009, changes in our franchise fee agreements in
    our Mid-Tex Division became effective which have significantly
    reduced the impact of this timing difference. However, this
    timing difference is still present for gross receipts taxes.

As discussed above, the cost of gas typically does not have a
    direct impact on our gross profit. However, higher gas costs may
    adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting
    in higher bad debt expense, and may require us to increase
    borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher
    interest expense. In addition, higher gas costs, as well as
    competitive factors in the industry and general economic
    conditions may cause customers to conserve or, in the case of
    industrial consumers, to use alternative energy sources.
    However, gas cost risk has been mitigated in recent years
    through improvements in rate design that allow us to collect
    from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense
    on approximately 65 percent of our residential and
    commercial margins.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2010 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2009

The $24.8 million increase in natural gas distribution
    gross profit primarily reflects rate adjustments and increased
    throughput as follows:

•

$33.7 million net increase in rate adjustments, primarily
    in the West Texas, Mid-Tex, Louisiana, Kentucky, Tennessee,
    Virginia and Mississippi service areas.



•

$11.2 million increase as a result of an 11 percent
    increase in consolidated throughput primarily associated with
    higher residential and commercial consumption and colder weather
    in most of our service areas.

These increases were partially offset by:

•

$7.6 million decrease due to a non-recurring adjustment
    recorded in the prior-year period to update the estimate for gas
    delivered to customers but not yet billed to reflect base rate
    changes.

•

$7.0 million decrease related to a prior-year reversal of
    an accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs that did not
    recur in the current year.

•

$1.6 million decrease in revenue-related taxes, primarily
    due to a decrease in revenues on which the tax is calculated.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
    expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
    amortization expense, taxes, other than income and asset
    impairments decreased $8.6 million, primarily due to the
    following:

•

$5.4 million decrease due to a state sales tax
    reimbursement received in March 2010.

•

$4.6 million decrease due to the absence of an impairment
    charge for

available-for-sale

securities recorded in the prior year.

•

$4.4 million decrease in contract labor expenses.

•

$4.4 million decrease in travel, legal and other
    administrative costs.

These decreases were partially offset by:

•

$7.4 million increase in employee-related expenses.

•

$4.3 million increase in taxes, other than income.

Miscellaneous income decreased $4.4 million due to lower
    interest income. Interest charges decreased $5.6 million
    primarily due to lower short-term debt balances and interest
    rates.

Additionally, results for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2009, were favorably impacted by a one-time
    tax benefit of $10.5 million. During the second quarter of
    fiscal 2009, the Company completed a study of the calculations
    used to estimate its deferred tax rate, and concluded that
    revisions to these calculations to include more specific
    jurisdictional tax rates would result in a more accurate
    calculation of the tax rate at which deferred taxes would
    reverse in the future. Accordingly, the Company modified the tax
    rate used to calculate deferred taxes from 38 percent to an
    individual rate for each legal entity. These rates vary from

36-41 percent

depending on the jurisdiction of the legal entity.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2008

The $18.6 million increase in natural gas distribution
    gross profit primarily reflects an increase in rates. The major
    components of the increase are as follows:

•

$13.6 million net increase in rates in the Mid-Tex Division
    as a result of the implementation of its 2008 Rate Review
    Mechanism (RRM) filing with all incorporated cities in the
    division other than the City of Dallas and environs (the Settled
    Cities) and adjustments for customers in the City of Dallas.

•

$16.0 million increase in other rate adjustments primarily
    in Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana and West Texas.

•

$7.6 million increase attributable to a non-recurring
    update to our estimate for gas delivered to customers but not
    yet billed to reflect changes in base rates in several of our
    jurisdictions recorded in the fiscal first quarter.

•

$7.0 million uncollectible gas cost accrual recorded in a
    prior year that was reversed in the current year period.



These increases were partially offset by:

•

$17.9 million decrease as a result of a five percent
    decrease in consolidated distribution throughput primarily
    associated with lower residential, commercial and industrial
    consumption and warmer weather in our Colorado service area,
    which does not have weather-normalized rates.

•

$10.8 million decrease due to lower revenue related taxes,
    partially offset by the associated franchise and state gross
    receipts tax expense recorded as a component of taxes other than
    income discussed below.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
    expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
    amortization expense, taxes, other than income and asset
    impairments decreased $9.3 million, primarily due to the
    following:

•

$10.6 million decrease due to lower legal, fuel and other
    administrative costs.

•

$9.2 million decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts
    due to the impact of recent rate design changes in certain
    jurisdictions that allow us to recover the gas cost portion of
    uncollectible accounts as well as a 23 percent

year-over-year

decline in the average cost of gas.

•

$9.2 million decrease in taxes other than income primarily
    associated with lower franchise fees and state gross receipt
    taxes.

These decreases were partially offset by:

•

$15.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization,
    due primarily to additional assets placed in service during the
    current year.

•

$4.6 million increase due to a noncash charge to impair
    certain

available-for-sale

investments as we believed the fair value of these investments
    would not recover within a reasonable period of time.

As discussed above, the results for fiscal 2009 include a
    $10.5 million tax benefit in the natural gas distribution
    segment. In addition, results for fiscal 2008 included a
    $1.2 million gain on the sale of irrigation assets in our
    West Texas Division.

Interest charges increased $6.1 million primarily due to
    the effect of the Company’s March 2009 issuance of
    $450 million 8.50% senior notes to repay
    $400 million 4.00% senior notes in April 2009. In
    addition, we experienced higher average short-term debt
    balances, interest rates and commitment fees during the current
    year compared to the prior year.

Regulated
    Transmission and Storage Segment

Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the
    regulated pipeline and storage operations of the Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division. The Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division transports natural gas to
    our Mid-Tex Division and third parties and manages five
    underground storage reservoirs in Texas. We also provide
    ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including
    parking arrangements, lending and sales of excess gas.

Similar to our natural gas distribution segment, our regulated
    transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather
    patterns, competitive factors in the energy industry and
    economic conditions in our service areas. Natural gas prices do
    not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are
    derived from the transportation of natural gas. However, natural
    gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level
    of drilling activity in the markets that we serve, which may
    influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on
    our pipeline. Further, natural gas price differences between the
    various hubs that we serve could influence customers to
    transport gas through our pipeline to capture arbitrage gains.

The results of Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division are
    also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of
    the Mid-Tex Division because it is the sole supplier of natural
    gas for our Mid-Tex Division.



Finally, as a regulated pipeline, the operations of the Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division may be impacted by the
    timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these
    costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2010 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2009

The $6.6 million decrease in regulated transmission and
    storage gross profit was attributable primarily to the following
    factors:

•

$13.3 million decrease due to lower transportation fees on
    through-system deliveries due to narrower basis spreads.

•

$2.6 million decrease due to decreased through-system
    volumes primarily associated with market conditions that
    resulted in reduced wellhead production, decreased drilling
    activity and increased competition, partially offset by
    increased deliveries to our Mid-Tex Division.

•

$1.6 million net decrease in market-based demand fees,
    priority reservation fees and compression activity associated
    with lower throughput.

These decreases were partially offset by the following:

•

$9.3 million increase associated with our GRIP filings.

•

$2.0 million increase of excess inventory sales in the
    current-year period.

Operating expenses decreased $10.5 million primarily due to:

•

$11.8 million decrease related to reduced contract labor.

•

$2.0 million decrease due to a state sales tax
    reimbursement received in March 2010.



These decreases were partially offset by a $2.1 million
    increase in taxes, other than income due to higher ad valorem
    and payroll taxes.

Miscellaneous income decreased $1.3 million due primarily
    to a decline in intercompany interest income.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2008

The $13.7 million increase in regulated transmission and
    storage gross profit was attributable primarily to the following
    factors:

•

$13.0 million increase from higher demand-based fees.

•

$5.6 million increase resulting from higher transportation
    fees on through-system deliveries due to market conditions.

•

$5.4 million increase due to our GRIP filings.

These increases were primarily offset by an $8.4 million
    decrease associated with a decrease in transportation volumes to
    our Mid-Tex Division due to warmer weather and a decrease in
    electrical generation, Barnett Shale and HUB deliveries.

Operating expenses increased $10.3 million primarily due to
    higher levels of pipeline maintenance activities.

Results for the current-year period also include a
    $1.7 million tax benefit associated with updating the rates
    used to determine our deferred taxes.

Natural
    Gas Marketing Segment

AEM’s primary business is to aggregate and purchase gas
    supply, arrange transportation and storage logistics and
    ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices. In
    addition, AEM utilizes proprietary and customer-owned
    transportation and storage assets to provide various services
    our customers request, including furnishing natural gas supplies
    at fixed and market-based prices, contract negotiation and
    administration, load forecasting, gas storage acquisition and
    management services, transportation services, peaking sales and
    balancing services, capacity utilization strategies and gas
    price hedging through the use of financial instruments. As a
    result, AEM’s margins arise from the types of commercial
    transactions we have structured with our customers and our
    ability to identify the lowest cost alternative among the
    natural gas supplies, transportation and markets to which it has
    access to serve those customers.

AEM seeks to enhance its gross profit margin from delivering gas
    by maximizing, through asset optimization activities, the
    economic value associated with the storage and transportation
    capacity we own or control in our natural gas distribution and
    natural gas marketing segments. We attempt to meet this
    objective by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in
    which we seek to find and profit through the arbitrage of
    pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing
    pricing differences that occur over time. This process involves
    purchasing physical natural gas, storing it in the storage and
    transportation assets to which AEM has access and selling
    financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross
    profit margin.

AEM continually manages its net physical position to attempt to
    increase the future economic profit that was created when the
    original transaction was executed. Therefore, AEM may
    subsequently change its originally scheduled storage injection
    and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on
    market conditions and recognize any associated gains or losses
    at that time. If AEM elects to accelerate the withdrawal of
    physical gas, it will execute new financial instruments to hedge
    the original financial instruments. If AEM elects to defer the
    withdrawal of gas, it will reset its positions by settling the
    original financial instruments and executing new financial
    instruments to correspond to the revised withdrawal schedule.

We use financial instruments, designated as fair value hedges,
    to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our natural gas
    marketing storage activities. These financial instruments are
    marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with
    changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses
    in the



period of change. The hedged natural gas inventory is marked to
    market at the end of each month based on the Gas Daily index
    with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and
    losses in the period of change. Changes in the spreads between
    the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial
    hedges designated against our physical inventory and the market
    (spot) prices used to value our physical storage result in
    unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is
    withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled.
    Once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are
    settled, the previously unrealized margins associated with these
    net positions are realized.

AEM also uses financial instruments to capture additional
    storage arbitrage opportunities that may arise after the
    original physical inventory hedge and to attempt to insulate and
    protect the economic value within its asset optimization
    activities. Changes in fair value associated with these
    financial instruments are recognized as a component of
    unrealized margins until they are settled.

Due to the nature of these operations, natural gas prices, and
    differences in natural gas prices between the various markets
    that we serve (commonly referred to as basis differentials),
    have a significant impact on our natural gas marketing
    operations. Within our delivered gas activities, basis
    differentials impact our ability to create value from
    identifying the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas
    supplies, transportation and markets to which we have access.
    Further, higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our
    accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt
    expense, and may require us to increase borrowings under our
    credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. Higher
    gas prices, as well as competitive factors in the industry and
    general economic conditions may also cause customers to conserve
    or use alternative energy sources. Within our asset optimization
    activities, higher gas prices could also lead to increased
    borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher
    interest expense.

Volatility in natural gas prices also has a significant impact
    on our natural gas marketing segment. Increased price volatility
    often has a significant impact on the spreads between the market
    (spot) prices and forward natural gas prices, which creates
    opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads within our asset
    optimization activities. Volatility could also impact the basis
    differentials we capture in our delivered gas activities.
    However, increased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized
    margins recorded in our gross profit and could impact the amount
    of cash required to collateralize our risk management
    liabilities.

Review of
    Financial and Operating Results

Financial and operational highlights for our natural gas
    marketing segment for the fiscal years ended September 30,
    2010, 2009 and 2008 are presented below. Gross profit margin
    consists primarily of margins earned from the delivery of gas
    and related services requested by our customers and margins
    earned from asset optimization activities, which are derived
    from the utilization of our proprietary and managed third party
    storage and transportation assets to capture favorable arbitrage
    spreads through natural gas trading activities.

Unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses on
    our net physical position and the related financial instruments
    used to manage commodity price risk as described above. These
    margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the
    physical and forward natural gas prices. Generally, if the
    physical/financial spread narrows, we will record unrealized
    gains or lower unrealized losses. If the physical/financial
    spread widens, we will record unrealized losses or lower
    unrealized gains. The magnitude of the unrealized gains and
    losses is also dependent upon the levels of our net physical
    position at the end of the reporting period.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2010 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2009

AEM’s delivered gas business contributed 62 percent of
    total realized margins during the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2010 with asset optimization activities
    contributing the remaining 38 percent. The
    $16.3 million decrease in realized gross profit reflected
    the following:

•

$15.8 million decrease in realized delivered gas margins
    due to lower

per-unit

margins as a result of narrowing basis spreads, combined with
    lower delivered sales volumes.

Per-unit

margins were

$0.14/Mcf

in
    the current-year period compared with $0.17/Mcf in the
    prior-year period, while delivered sales volumes were
    5 percent lower in the current year when compared with the
    prior year.

•

$0.5 million decrease in asset optimization margins
    primarily due to higher storage demand fees partially offset by
    higher realized storage and trading gains during the fiscal year.

The decrease in realized gross profit was more than offset by a
    $17.6 million increase in unrealized margins due to the

period-over-period

timing of storage withdrawal gains and the associated reversal
    of unrealized gains into realized gains.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
    expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
    amortization expense, taxes, other than income taxes and asset
    impairments decreased $6.5 million primarily due to a
    decrease in employee and other administrative costs.

Miscellaneous income increased $1.7 million due to proceeds
    received from a

class-action

legal settlement in the current year. Interest charges decreased
    $3.6 million primarily due to a decrease in intercompany
    borrowings.

Asset
    Optimization Activities

AEM monitors the impact of its asset optimization efforts by
    estimating the gross profit, before related fees, that it
    captured through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas
    and the execution of the associated



financial instruments. This economic value, combined with the
    effect of the future reversal of unrealized gains or losses
    currently recognized in the income statement and related fees is
    referred to as the potential gross profit.

We define potential gross profit as the change in AEM’s
    gross profit in future periods if its optimization efforts are
    executed as planned. This amount does not include other
    operating expenses and associated income taxes that will be
    incurred to realize this amount. Therefore, it does not
    represent an estimated increase in future net income. There is
    no assurance that the economic value or the potential gross
    profit will be fully realized in the future.

We consider this measure a non-GAAP financial measure as it is
    calculated using both forward-looking storage
    injection/withdrawal and hedge settlement estimates and
    historical financial information. This measure is presented
    because we believe it provides a more comprehensive view to
    investors of our asset optimization efforts and thus a better
    understanding of these activities than would be presented by
    GAAP measures alone. Because there is no assurance that the
    economic value or potential gross profit will be realized in the
    future, corresponding future GAAP amounts are not available.

The following table presents AEM’s economic value and its
    potential gross profit (loss) at September 30, 2010 and
    2009.

Related fees represent AEM’s contractual costs to acquire
    the storage capacity utilized in its asset optimization
    operations. The fees primarily consist of demand fees and
    contractual obligations to sell gas below market index in
    exchange for the right to manage and optimize third party
    storage assets for the positions AEM has entered into as of
    September 30, 2010 and 2009.

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, AEM’s
    economic value decreased from $28.6 million, or $2.07/Mcf
    at September 30, 2009 to a negative economic value of
    $7.8 million, or $0.57/Mcf.

Early in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, AEM withdrew gas and
    realized previously captured spread values. As current cash
    prices declined during the first fiscal quarter, AEM injected
    gas and rolled positions into the second fiscal quarter to
    increase economic value. These positions were settled in the
    second fiscal quarter and the associated economic value was
    realized. However, during the year, weak market fundamentals
    have caused cash prices to remain low and have contracted

spot-to-forward

spread values, which has limited opportunities to capture
    economic value. Therefore, during the fiscal third and fourth
    quarters, AEM elected to forego capturing these narrower spread
    values and maintained a short-term trading position. We
    anticipate

spot-to-forward

spread values will expand in the near term and we expect to be
    able to roll positions and capture greater economic value than
    what we can capture as of September 30, 2010. However, the
    short-dated nature of AEM’s trading positions combined with
    current short-term forward prices that are lower than the cost
    of gas that was injected into storage in prior periods resulted
    in negative economic value as of September 30, 2010.

The economic value is based upon planned storage injection and
    withdrawal schedules and its realization is contingent upon the
    execution of this plan, weather and other execution factors.
    Since AEM actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to
    attempt to enhance the future profitability of its storage
    position, it may



change its scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from
    one time period to another based on market conditions.
    Therefore, we cannot ensure that the economic value or the
    potential gross profit or loss calculated as of
    September 30, 2010 will be fully realized in the future nor
    can we predict in what time periods such realization may occur.
    Further, if we experience operational or other issues which
    limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions,
    our earnings could be adversely impacted.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2008

AEM’s delivered gas business contributed 67 percent to
    total realized margins during fiscal 2009 with asset
    optimization activities contributing the remaining
    33 percent. In the prior year, delivered gas activities
    represented substantially all of AEM’s realized gross
    profit margin. The $45.5 million increase in realized gross
    profit reflected:

•

A $43.8 million increase in asset optimization margins. AEM
    realized substantially all of its realized asset optimization
    margin in the fiscal 2009 first quarter when it realized
    substantially all of the economic value that it had captured as
    of September 30, 2008 from withdrawing gas and settling the
    associated financial instruments. Since that time, as a result
    of falling current cash prices, AEM has been deferring storage
    withdrawals and has been a net injector of gas into storage to
    increase the economic value it could realize in future periods
    from its asset optimization activities. In the prior year, AEM
    deferred storage withdrawals primarily into fiscal 2009 and
    recognized losses on the settlement of the associated financial
    instruments.

•

A $1.7 million increase in realized delivered gas margins.
    AEM experienced a six percent increase in

per-unit

margins as a result of improved basis spreads in certain market
    areas where we were able to better optimize transportation
    assets and successful contract renewals. These margins
    improvements more than offset a four percent decrease in gross
    sales volumes primarily attributable to lower industrial demand
    as a result of the current economic climate.

The increase in realized gross profit was more than offset by a
    $53.9 million decrease in unrealized margins attributable
    to the following:

•

The realization of unrealized gains recorded during fiscal 2008.

•

A modest widening of the physical/financial spreads, partially
    offset by favorable unrealized basis gains in certain markets.

•

A 5.8 Bcf increase in AEM’s net physical position.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
    expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
    amortization expense, taxes, other than income taxes, and asset
    impairments increased $1.6 million primarily due the
    following factors:

•

$4.0 million increase in legal and other administrative
    costs.

•

$2.4 million decrease related to tax matters incurred in
    the prior year that did not recur in the current year.

Pipeline,
    Storage and Other Segment

Our pipeline, storage and other segment consists primarily of
    the operations of Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC (APS). APS is
    engaged in nonregulated transmission, storage and natural
    gas-gathering services. Its primary asset is a proprietary
    21 mile pipeline located in New Orleans, Louisiana that is
    principally used to aggregate gas supply for our regulated
    natural gas distribution division in Louisiana, our natural gas
    marketing segment, and, on a more limited basis, for third
    parties. APS also owns or has an interest in underground storage
    fields in Kentucky and Louisiana that are used to reduce the
    need of our natural gas distribution divisions to contract for
    additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak
    periods.

In addition, APS engages in asset optimization activities
    whereby it seeks to maximize the economic value associated with
    the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls.
    Certain of these arrangements



are with regulated affiliates of the Company which have been
    approved by applicable state regulatory commissions. Generally,
    these asset management plans require APS to share with our
    regulated customers a portion of the profits earned from these
    arrangements. APS also seeks to maximize the economic value
    associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns
    or controls by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in
    which it seeks to find and profit from the pricing differences
    that occur over time.

Results for this segment are primarily impacted by seasonal
    weather patterns and, similar to our natural gas marketing
    segment, volatility in the natural gas markets. Additionally,
    this segment’s results include an unrealized component as
    APS hedges its risk associated with its asset optimization
    activities.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2010 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2009

Gross profit from our pipeline, storage and other segment
    decreased $1.4 million primarily due to the following:

•

$4.9 million decrease from lower margins earned on storage
    optimization activities.

•

$3.9 million decrease in basis gains earned from utilizing
    leased capacity.

•

$2.4 million decrease from lower margins earned on asset
    management plans.

•

$10.5 million increase in unrealized margins associated
    with our asset optimization activities.

Operating expenses increased $1.4 million primarily due to
    increased operating costs associated with APS’ gas
    gathering activities and administrative costs.

Miscellaneous income decreased $3.2 million primarily due
    to lower intercompany interest income earned by this segment.



Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2008

Gross profit from our pipeline, storage and other segment
    increased $1.2 million primarily due to the following:

•

$16.3 million increase in asset optimization margins as a
    result of larger realized gains from the settlement of financial
    positions associated with storage and trading activities, basis
    gains earned from utilizing controlled pipeline capacity and
    higher margins earned under asset management plans.

•

$12.2 million decrease in unrealized margins associated
    with our asset optimization activities due to a widening of the
    spreads between current cash prices and forward natural gas
    prices.

Operating expenses increased $3.0 million primarily due to
    increased employee costs and higher depreciation expense which
    was largely attributable to additional assets placed in service
    during the year.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital
    expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of
    sources, including internally generated funds and borrowings
    under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities.
    Additionally, we have various uncommitted trade credit lines
    with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas
    on a monthly basis. Finally, from time to time, we raise funds
    from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our
    liquidity needs.

We regularly evaluate our funding strategy and profile to ensure
    that we have sufficient liquidity for our short-term and
    long-term needs in a cost-effective manner. We also evaluate the
    levels of committed borrowing capacity that we require. In
    fiscal 2011, we anticipate consolidating our short-term
    facilities used for our regulated operations into a single line
    of credit. In October 2010, we replaced our $200 million

364-day

revolving credit agreement with a $200 million

180-day

revolving credit agreement. Additionally, we intend to replace
    AEM’s $450 million

364-day

facility with a $200 million, three-year facility when it
    expires in December 2010.

Our $350 million unsecured 7.375% Senior Notes will
    mature in May 2011. We intend to refinance this debt on a
    long-term basis through the issuance of

30-year

unsecured senior notes in June 2011. Additionally, we plan to
    issue $250 million of

30-year

unsecured senior notes in November 2011 to fund our capital
    expenditure program. On September 30, 2010, we entered into
    five Treasury lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield
    component of the interest cost of financing the anticipated
    issuances of senior notes. We designated all of the Treasury
    lock agreements as cash flow hedges of an anticipated
    transaction. Any realized gain or loss incurred when these
    agreements are settled will be recognized as a component of
    interest expense over the life of the related long-term debt.

We believe the liquidity provided by our senior notes and
    committed credit facilities, combined with our operating cash
    flows, will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and
    capital expenditure program for fiscal year 2011.

Cash
    Flows

Our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a
    number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These
    include regulatory changes, the price for our services, the
    demand for such products and services, margin requirements
    resulting from significant changes in commodity prices,
    operational risks and other factors.



Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities
    for the years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are
    presented below.

Cash
    flows from operating activities

Year-over-year

changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable
    to changes in net income, working capital changes, particularly
    within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the
    price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections,
    payments for natural gas purchases and purchased gas cost
    recoveries. The significant factors impacting our operating cash
    flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below.

Fiscal
    Year ended September 30, 2010 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2009

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we generated
    operating cash flow of $726.5 million from operating
    activities compared with $919.2 million in the prior year,
    primarily due to the fluctuation in gas costs. Gas costs, which
    reached historically high levels during the 2008 injection
    season, declined sharply when the economy slipped into the
    recession and have remained relatively stable since that time.
    Operating cash flows for the fiscal 2010 period reflect the
    recovery of lower gas costs through purchased gas recovery
    mechanisms and sales. This is in contrast to the fiscal 2009
    period, where operating cash flows were favorably influenced by
    the recovery of high gas costs during a period of falling prices.

Fiscal
    Year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2008

Operating cash flows were $548.3 million higher in fiscal
    2009 compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following:

•

$368.9 million increase attributable to the favorable
    impact on our working capital due to the decline in natural gas
    prices in the current year compared to the prior year.

•

$56.8 million increase due to lower cash margin
    requirements related to our natural gas marketing financial
    instruments.

•

These increases were partially offset by a $21.0 million
    decrease due to a contribution made to our pension plans in the
    current year.

Cash
    flows from investing activities

In recent fiscal years, a substantial portion of our cash
    resources has been used to fund acquisitions and growth
    projects, our ongoing construction program and improvements to
    information technology systems. Our ongoing construction program
    enables us to provide natural gas distribution services to our
    existing customer base, expand our natural gas distribution
    services into new markets, enhance the integrity of our
    pipelines and, more recently, expand our intrastate pipeline
    network. In executing our current rate strategy, we are focusing
    our capital spending in jurisdictions that permit us to earn an
    adequate return timely on our investment without



compromising the safety or reliability of our system. Currently,
    our Mid-Tex, Louisiana, Mississippi and West Texas natural gas
    distribution divisions and our Atmos Pipeline — Texas
    Division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to
    include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic
    basis without being required to file a rate case.

Since early 2010, we have been discussing the financial and
    operational details of an accelerated steel service line
    replacement program with representatives of 440 municipalities
    served by our Mid-Tex Division. Two coalitions of cities,
    representing the majority of the cities our Mid-Tex Division
    serves, have agreed to a program of installing 100,000
    replacements during the next two years, with approved recovery
    of the associated return, depreciation and taxes. Under the
    terms of the agreement, the accelerated replacement program will
    commence in fiscal 2011 at a total projected capital cost of
    $80 — $120 million, with completion expected in
    September 2012. As a result of this project and spending to
    replace our regulated customer service systems and our
    nonregulated energy trading risk management system, we
    anticipate capital expenditures will increase significantly
    during the next two fiscal years.

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we incurred
    $542.6 million for capital expenditures compared with
    $509.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30,
    2009 and $472.3 million for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2008.

The $33.1 million increase in capital expenditures in
    fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily reflects spending
    for the relocation of our information technology data center to
    a new facility, the construction of two service centers and the
    steel service line replacement program in our Mid-Tex Division.

The increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 compared to
    fiscal 2008 primarily reflects $32.6 million related to
    spending for a regulated transmission pipeline project completed
    in the fourth quarter of 2009.

Cash
    flows from financing activities

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, our financing
    activities used $163.0 million in cash, while financing
    activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009
    used $337.5 million in cash compared with cash of
    $98.1 million provided for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2008. Our significant financing activities
    for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and
    2008 are summarized as follows:


During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we:

•

Paid $124.3 million in cash dividends which reflected a
    payout ratio of 61 percent of net income.

•

Paid $100.5 million for the repurchase of common stock
    under our accelerated share repurchase program.

•

Borrowed a net $54.3 million under our short-term
    facilities due to the impact of seasonal natural gas purchases.

•

Received $8.8 million net proceeds related to the issuance
    of 0.4 million shares of common stock, which is a
    68 percent decrease compared to the prior year due
    primarily to the fact that in fiscal 2010 shares have begun
    to be purchased on the open market rather than being issued by
    us to the Direct Stock Purchase Plan and the Retirement Savings
    Plan.

•

Paid $1.2 million to repurchase equity awards.


During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, we:

•

Paid $407.4 million to repay our $400 million 4.00%
    unsecured notes.

•

Repaid a net $284.0 million short-term borrowings under our
    credit facilities.



•

Paid $121.5 million in cash dividends which reflected a
    payout ratio of 64 percent of net income.

•

Received $445.6 million in net proceeds related to the
    March 2009 issuance of $450 million of 8.50% Senior
    Notes due 2019. The net proceeds were used to repay the
    $400 million 4.00% unsecured notes.

•

Received $27.7 million net proceeds related to the issuance
    of 1.2 million shares of common stock.

•

Received $1.9 million net proceeds related to the
    settlement of the Treasury lock agreement associated with the
    March 2009 issuance of the $450 million of
    8.50% Senior Notes due 2019.


During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, we:

•

Borrowed a net $200.2 million under our short-term
    facilities due to the impact of seasonal natural gas purchases
    and the effect of higher natural gas prices.

•

Repaid $10.3 million long-term debt in accordance with
    their normal maturity schedules.

•

Received $25.5 million in net proceeds related to the
    issuance of 1.0 million shares of common stock.

•

Paid $117.3 million in dividends, which reflected a payout
    ratio of 65 percent of net income.

The following table shows the number of shares issued for the
    fiscal years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008:

The

year-over-year

decrease in the number of shares issued primarily reflects the
    fact that in fiscal 2010, shares have begun to be purchased in
    the open market rather than by being issued by us to the Direct
    Stock Purchase Plan and the Retirement Savings Plan. In
    addition, we awarded fewer shares under our 1998 Long-Term
    Incentive Plan due to the Company achieving a lower level of
    performance relative to the target performance established under
    the Plan during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Further, a
    higher average stock price during the second and third quarters
    of fiscal 2010 compared to the second and third quarters of 2009
    enabled us to issue fewer shares during the current year.

During the fiscal year, we repurchased 2,958,580 common shares
    as part of the accelerated share repurchase agreement that is
    described in further detail below. Additionally, we repurchased
    37,365 shares attributable to equity awards during the
    year. The repurchased share activity is not included in the
    table above.

Share
    Repurchase Agreement

On, July 1, 2010, we entered into an accelerated share
    repurchase agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. under
    which we repurchased $100 million of our outstanding common
    stock in order to offset stock grants made under our various
    employee and director incentive compensation plans.

We paid $100 million to Goldman Sachs & Co. on
    July 7, 2010 for shares of Atmos Energy common stock in a
    share forward transaction and received 2,958,580 shares. We
    will receive the balance of the shares at the conclusion of the
    term of the repurchase agreement. The specific number of shares
    we will ultimately repurchase in the transaction will be based
    generally on the average of the daily volume-weighted average
    share price of our common stock over the duration of the
    agreement. The agreement is scheduled to end in



March 2011, although the termination date may be accelerated at
    the option of Goldman Sachs & Co. As a result of this
    transaction, beginning in our fourth fiscal quarter, the number
    of outstanding shares used to calculate our earnings per share
    was reduced by the number of shares received and the
    $100 million purchase price was recorded as a reduction in
    shareholders’ equity. The number of shares used to
    calculate our earnings per share in fiscal 2011 will continue to
    be reduced by the shares we received in July 2010; however, the
    total impact to diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011 will
    be dependent upon the average share price of our common stock
    over the remainder of the agreement.

Credit
    Facilities

Our short-term borrowing requirements are affected by the
    seasonal nature of the natural gas business. Changes in the
    price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to
    supply to meet our customers’ needs could significantly
    affect our borrowing requirements. However, our short-term
    borrowings typically reach their highest levels in the winter
    months.

As of September 30, 2010, we financed our short-term
    borrowing requirements through a combination of a
    $566.7 million commercial paper program and four committed
    credit facilities with third-party lenders that provide
    approximately $1.2 billion of working capital funding. As
    of September 30, 2010, the amount available to us under our
    credit facilities, net of outstanding letters of credit was
    $834.8 million. These facilities are described in further
    detail in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

In October 2010, our $200 million

364-day

facility expired and our five-year $566.7 million facility
    will expire in December 2011. We replaced the $200 million

364-day

facility before its expiration with a $200 million

180-day

credit facility that will expire in April 2011. We do not plan
    to replace this facility upon expiration. We expect to begin
    discussions in fiscal 2011 to replace the expiring five-year
    $566.7 million facility with a larger multi-year credit
    facility. We believe our existing five-year facility will
    provide adequate short-term borrowing capacity until we can
    successfully execute a new multi-year credit facility.

Additionally, on December 9, 2010, AEM’s existing
    $450 million committed revolving credit facility will
    expire. In October 2010, we received regulatory approval to
    increase AEH’s intercompany demand credit facility with AEC
    from $200 million to $350 million, effective
    December 1, 2010 through December 31, 2011. As a
    result of this increase, we are in discussions with our
    third-party lenders to replace AEM’s $450 million
    committed revolving credit facility with a $200 million
    three-year committed revolving credit facility with an accordion
    feature that could increase AEM’s borrowing capacity to
    $500 million. As a result of consolidating and reducing the
    amounts available under our facilities, we expect to reduce our
    short-term financing costs.

Shelf
    Registration

On March 31, 2010, we filed a registration statement with
    the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue, from time
    to time, up to $1.3 billion in common stock

and/or

debt
    securities available for issuance. We had already received
    approvals from all requisite state regulatory commissions to
    issue a total of $1.3 billion in common stock

and/or

debt
    securities under the new shelf registration statement, including
    the carryforward of the $450 million of securities
    remaining available for issuance under our shelf registration
    statement filed with the SEC on March 23, 2009. Due to
    certain restrictions imposed by one state regulatory commission
    on our ability to issue securities under the new registration
    statement, we will be able to issue a total of $950 million
    in debt securities and $350 million in equity securities.

Credit
    Ratings

Our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain
    short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the cost of
    such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating
    agencies consider a number of quantitative factors, including
    debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to
    outstanding debt, operating cash flow coverage of interest and
    pension liabilities and funding status. In addition, the rating
    agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our
    earnings over time, the quality of our management and business
    strategy, the risks associated with our regulated and
    nonregulated businesses and the regulatory structures that
    govern our rates in the states where we operate.



Our debt is rated by three rating agencies: Standard &
    Poor’s Corporation (S&P), Moody’s Investors
    Service (Moody’s) and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (Fitch). In March
    2010, Moody’s upgraded our rating outlook from stable to
    positive and affirmed the credit rating on our senior long-term
    debt at Baa2 and on our commercial paper at

P-2.

Moody’s stated that the key driver for the upgrade was
    successful rate case outcomes over the past year. In March 2010,
    S&P affirmed our senior long-term debt credit rating of
    BBB+ and our rating outlook as stable. In June 2010, Fitch
    reaffirmed our senior long-term debt rating of BBB+ and
    commercial paper ratings of F-2 and upgraded our rating outlook
    from stable to positive. Fitch cited our effective management of
    the regulatory process as well as our consistent financial and
    operational performance as the primary reasons for the upgrade.
    Our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and
    are as follows:

S&P

Moody’s

Fitch

Unsecured senior long-term debt

BBB+

Baa2

BBB+

Commercial paper

A-2

P-2

F-2

A significant degradation in our operating performance or a
    significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited
    access to the private and public credit markets as a result of
    deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions
    could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a
    reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating
    agencies. This would mean more limited access to the private and
    public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such
    borrowings.

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
    securities. The highest investment grade credit rating for is
    AAA for S&P, Aaa for Moody’s and AAA for Fitch. The
    lowest investment grade credit rating is BBB- for S&P, Baa3
    for Moody’s and BBB- for Fitch. Our credit ratings may be
    revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies, and
    each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
    rating. There can be no assurance that a rating will remain in
    effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be
    lowered, or withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its
    judgment, circumstances so warrant.

Debt
    Covenants

We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of
    September 30, 2010. Our debt covenants are described in
    Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

    September 30, 2010 and 2009. The increase in the debt to
    capitalization ratio primarily reflects an increase in
    short-term debt as of September 30, 2010 compared to the
    prior year. Our ratio of total debt to capitalization is
    typically greater during the winter heating season as we make
    additional short-term borrowings to fund natural gas purchases
    and meet our working capital requirements. We intend to maintain
    our debt to capitalization ratio in a target range of 50 to
    55 percent.

AEM has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural
    gas under contracts indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed
    price contracts. At September 30, 2010, AEM was committed
    to purchase 69.5 Bcf within one year, 28.4 Bcf within
    one to three years and 3.2 Bcf after three years under
    indexed contracts. AEM is committed to purchase 3.1 Bcf
    within one year and 0.3 Bcf within one to three years under
    fixed price contracts with prices ranging from $3.55 to $6.36
    per Mcf.

With the exception of our Mid-Tex Division, our natural gas
    distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several
    vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year.
    Commitments for estimated



base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a
    monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices. Commitments
    for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the
    month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract.
    Our Mid-Tex Division maintains long-term supply contracts to
    ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service
    area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market
    prices. The estimated commitments under these contract terms as
    of September 30, 2010 are reflected in the table above.

Risk
    Management Activities

We use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk
    and, periodically, to manage interest rate risk. We conduct risk
    management activities through our natural gas distribution,
    natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments.
    In our natural gas distribution segment, we use a combination of
    physical storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed financial
    contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large
    winter-period gas price increases. In our natural gas marketing
    and pipeline, storage and other segments, we manage our exposure
    to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross
    profit margin through a combination of storage and financial
    instruments, including futures,

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with
    counterparties. To the extent our inventory cost and actual
    sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in
    the market indices we use in our hedges, we could experience
    ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting
    requirements for hedge accounting, resulting in the financial
    instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through
    earnings.

We use financial instruments, designated as cash flow hedges of
    anticipated purchases and sales at index prices, to mitigate the
    commodity price risk in our natural gas marketing segment
    associated with deliveries under fixed-priced forward contracts
    to deliver gas to customers, and we use financial instruments,
    designated as fair value hedges, to hedge our natural gas
    inventory used in our asset optimization activities in our
    natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments.

Also, in our natural gas marketing segment, we use storage swaps
    and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage
    opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the
    original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural
    gas inventory, basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic
    value of our fixed price and storage books and various

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options. These financial instruments have
    not been designated as hedges.

We record our financial instruments as a component of risk
    management assets and liabilities, which are classified as
    current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date
    of the underlying financial instrument. Substantially all of our

Employee
    Benefit Programs

An important element of our total compensation program, and a
    significant component of our operation and maintenance expense,
    is the offering of various benefit programs to our employees.
    These programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and
    pension and postretirement programs.

Medical
    and Dental Insurance

We offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially
    all of our employees, and we believe these programs are
    consistent with other programs in our industry. Since 2005, we
    have experienced medical and prescription inflation of
    approximately seven percent. In recent years, we have strived to
    actively manage our health care costs through the introduction
    of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to
    identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved
    lifestyle choices.

Net
    Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit Costs

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, our total net
    periodic pension and other benefits costs was
    $50.8 million, compared with $50.2 million and
    $47.9 million for the fiscal years ended September 30,



and 2008. These costs relating to our natural gas distribution
    operations are recoverable through our gas distribution rates. A
    portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas distribution
    rate base, and the remaining costs are recorded as a component
    of operation and maintenance expense.

The increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits
    costs during fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 primarily
    reflects the decline in fair value of our plan assets. The
    discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan’s
    liabilities generally is based on rates of high-grade corporate
    bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which
    the benefits will be paid. At our September 30, 2009
    measurement date, the interest rates were slightly lower than
    the interest rates at September 30, 2008, the measurement
    date used to determine our fiscal 2009 net periodic cost.
    Our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant
    at 8.25%.

The increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits
    costs during fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 primarily
    reflects the change in assumptions we made during our annual
    pension plan valuation completed September 30, 2008. The
    discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan’s
    liabilities generally was based on rates of high-grade corporate
    bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which
    the benefits will be paid. At our September 30, 2008
    measurement date, the interest rates were approximately
    130 basis points higher than the interest rates at
    June 30, 2007, the measurement date used to determine our
    fiscal 2008 net periodic cost. The corresponding increase
    in the discount rate was the primary driver for the increase in
    our fiscal 2009 pension and benefit costs. Our expected return
    on our pension plan assets remained constant at 8.25%.

Pension
    and Postretirement Plan Funding

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an
    amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to
    comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
    However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time
    to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to
    provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but
    also for those expected to be earned in the future.

During fiscal 2010, we did not contribute cash to our pension
    plans as the fair value of the plans’ assets recovered
    somewhat during the year from the unfavorable market conditions
    experienced in the latter half of calendar year 2008 and our
    plan assets were sufficient to achieve a desirable funding
    threshold as established by the Pension Protection Act of 2006
    (PPA). During fiscal 2009, we contributed $21.0 million to
    our pension plans to achieve the same desired level of funding
    as established by the PPA. During fiscal 2008, we voluntarily
    contributed $2.3 million to the Atmos Energy Corporation
    Retirement Plan for Mississippi Valley Gas Union Employees. This
    contribution achieved a desired level of funding for this plan
    for the 2007 plan year.

We contributed $11.8 million, $10.1 million and
    $9.6 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the
    fiscal years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The
    contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs
    we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum
    funding required by state regulatory commissions.

Outlook
    for Fiscal 2011 and Beyond

As of September 30, 2010, interest and corporate bond rates
    utilized to determine our discount rates, which impacted our
    fiscal 2011 net periodic pension and postretirement costs,
    were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of
    September 30, 2009, the measurement date for our fiscal
    2010 net periodic cost. As a result of the lower interest
    and corporate bond rates, we decreased the discount rate used to
    determine our fiscal 2011 pension and benefit costs to
    5.39 percent. We maintained the expected return on our
    pension plan assets at 8.25 percent, despite the recent
    uncertainty in the financial markets as we believe this rate
    reflects the average rate of expected earnings on plan assets
    that will fund our projected benefit obligation. Although the
    fair value of our plan assets has declined as the financial
    markets have declined, the impact of this decline is partially
    mitigated by the fact that assets are smoothed for purposes of
    determining net periodic pension cost which results in asset
    gains and losses that are recognized over time as a component of
    net periodic pension and benefit costs for our Pension Account
    Plan, our largest funded plan. Due to the decline in the fair
    value of



our plan assets, we expect our fiscal 2011 pension and
    postretirement medical costs to increase compared to fiscal
    2010. Based upon market conditions subsequent to
    September 30, 2010, the current funded position of the
    plans and the new funding requirements under the PPA, we believe
    it is reasonably possible that we will be required to contribute
    to the Plans in fiscal 2011. Further, we will consider whether
    an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain
    certain PPA funding thresholds. However, we cannot anticipate
    with certainty whether such contributions will be made and the
    amount of such contributions. With respect to our postretirement
    medical plans, we anticipate contributing approximately
    $13.0 million during fiscal 2011.

The projected pension liability, future funding requirements and
    the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the Plan
    are subject to change, depending upon the actuarial value of
    plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations
    as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date. These amounts
    are impacted by actual investment returns, changes in interest
    rates and changes in the demographic composition of the
    participants in the plan.

In August 2010, the Board of Directors of Atmos Energy approved
    a proposal to close the Pension Account Plan (PAP) to new
    participants, effective October 1, 2010. Employees
    participating in the PAP as of October 1, 2010 will be
    allowed to make a one-time election to migrate from the PAP into
    our defined contribution plan with enhanced features, effective
    January 1, 2011. Participants who choose to remain in the
    PAP will continue to earn benefits and interest allocations with
    no changes to their existing benefits.

In March 2010, President Obama signed

The Patient Protection
    and Affordable Care Act

into law (the “Health Care
    Reform Act”). The Health Care Reform Act will be phased in
    over an eight-year period. Although we are still assessing the
    impact of the Health Care Reform Act on the health care benefits
    we provide to our employees, the design of our health care plans
    has already changed in order to comply with provisions of the
    Health Care Reform Act that have already gone into effect or
    will be going into effect in 2011. For example, lifetime
    maximums on benefits have been eliminated, coverage for
    dependent children has been extended to age 26 and all
    costs of preventive coverage must be paid for by the insurer. In
    2014, health insurance exchanges will open in each state in
    order to provide a competitive marketplace for purchasing health
    insurance by individuals. Companies who offer health insurance
    to their employees could face a substantial increase in premiums
    at that time if they choose to continue to provide such
    coverage. However, companies who elect to cease providing health
    insurance to their employees will be faced with paying
    significant penalties to the federal government for each
    employee who receives coverage through an exchange. We will
    continue to monitor all developments on health care reform and
    continue to comply with all existing relevant laws and
    regulations.

For fiscal 2011, we anticipate an approximate 10 percent
    medical and prescription drug inflation rate, primarily due to
    anticipated higher claims costs and the initial implementation
    of the Health Care Reform Act.

RECENT
    ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

Recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows are described in
    Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and
    interest rates. Commodity price risk is the potential loss that
    we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a
    particular instrument or commodity. Interest-rate risk results
    from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue
    to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities.

We conduct risk management activities through both our natural
    gas distribution and natural gas marketing segments. In our
    natural gas distribution segment, we use a combination of
    physical storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed financial
    contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually
    large winter period gas price increases. In our natural gas
    marketing segment, we manage our exposure to the risk of natural
    gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a
    combination of storage and financial instruments including
    futures,

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with



counterparties. Our risk management activities and related
    accounting treatment are described in further detail in
    Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
    Additionally, our earnings are affected by changes in short-term
    interest rates as a result of our issuance of short-term
    commercial paper and our other short-term borrowings.

Commodity
    Price Risk

Natural
    gas distribution segment

We purchase natural gas for our natural gas distribution
    operations. Substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for
    natural gas distribution operations are recovered from our
    customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms.
    Therefore, our natural gas distribution operations have limited
    commodity price risk exposure.

Natural
    gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other
    segments

Our natural gas marketing segment is also exposed to risks
    associated with changes in the market price of natural gas. For
    our natural gas marketing segment, we use a sensitivity analysis
    to estimate commodity price risk. For purposes of this analysis,
    we estimate commodity price risk by applying a $0.50 change in
    the forward NYMEX price to our net open position (including
    existing storage and related financial contracts) at the end of
    each period. Based on AEH’s net open position (including
    existing storage and related financial contracts) at
    September 30, 2010 of 0.1 Bcf, a $0.50 change in the
    forward NYMEX price would have had a $0.1 million impact on
    our consolidated net income.

Changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to
    market our physical inventory (Gas Daily) and the related
    fair-value hedge (NYMEX) can result in volatility in our
    reported net income; but, over time, gains and losses on the
    sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses
    on the fair-value hedges. Based upon our net physical position
    at September 30, 2010 and assuming our hedges would still
    qualify as highly effective, a $0.50 change in the difference
    between the Gas Daily and NYMEX indices would impact our
    reported net income by approximately $4.8 million.

Additionally, these changes could cause us to recognize a risk
    management liability, which would require us to place cash into
    an escrow account to collateralize this liability position.
    This, in turn, would reduce the amount of cash we would have on
    hand to fund our working capital needs.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our earnings are exposed to changes in short-term interest rates
    associated with our short-term commercial paper program and
    other short-term borrowings. We use a sensitivity analysis to
    estimate our short-term interest rate risk. For purposes of this
    analysis, we estimate our short-term interest rate risk as the
    difference between our actual interest expense for the period
    and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a
    hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates
    associated with our short-term borrowings. Had interest rates
    associated with our short-term borrowings increased by an
    average of one percent, our interest expense would have
    increased by approximately $1.5 million during 2010.

As of September 30, 2010, we were not engaged in other
    activities that would cause exposure to the risk of material
    earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or
    market commodity prices.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Atmos Energy Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Atmos Energy Corporation as of September 30, 2010 and 2009,
    and the related consolidated statements of income,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended September 30, 2010. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    Index at Item 8. These financial statements and schedule
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Atmos Energy Corporation at
    September 30, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results
    of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
    in the period ended September 30, 2010, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the financial statements taken as a
    whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Atmos Energy Corporation’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2010,
    based on criteria established in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
    November 12, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Nature of
    Business

Atmos Energy Corporation (“Atmos Energy” or the
    “Company”) and our subsidiaries are engaged primarily
    in the regulated natural gas distribution and transmission and
    storage businesses as well as certain other nonregulated
    businesses. Through our natural gas distribution business, we
    deliver natural gas through sales and transportation
    arrangements to over three million residential, commercial,
    public-authority and industrial customers through our six
    regulated natural gas distribution divisions in the service
    areas described below:

Denotes locations where we have more limited service areas.

In addition, we transport natural gas for others through our
    distribution system. Our natural gas distribution business is
    subject to federal and state regulation

and/or

regulation by local authorities in each of the states in which
    our natural gas distribution divisions operate. Our corporate
    headquarters and shared-services function are located in Dallas,
    Texas, and our customer support centers are located in Amarillo
    and Waco, Texas.

Our regulated transmission and storage business consists of the
    regulated operations of our Atmos Pipeline — Texas
    Division, a division of the Company. This division transports
    natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division, transports natural gas for
    third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in
    Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary to the
    pipeline industry including parking arrangements, lending and
    sales of inventory on hand. Parking arrangements provide
    short-term interruptible storage of gas on our pipeline. Lending
    services provide short-term interruptible loans of natural gas
    from our pipeline to meet market demands.

Our nonregulated businesses operate primarily in the Midwest and
    Southeast and include our natural gas marketing operations and
    our pipeline, storage and other operations. These businesses are
    operated through various wholly-owned subsidiaries of Atmos
    Energy Holdings, Inc. (AEH), which is wholly-owned by the
    Company and based in Houston, Texas.

Our natural gas marketing operations are conducted through Atmos
    Energy Marketing, LLC (AEM), which is wholly-owned by AEH. AEM
    provides a variety of natural gas management services to
    municipalities, natural gas utility systems and industrial
    natural gas customers, primarily in the southeastern and
    midwestern states and to our Colorado-Kansas,
    Kentucky/Mid-States and Louisiana divisions. These services
    consist primarily of furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed
    and market-based prices, contract negotiation and
    administration, load forecasting, gas storage acquisition and
    management services, transportation services, peaking sales and
    balancing services, capacity utilization strategies and gas
    price hedging through the use of financial instruments.

Our pipeline, storage and other segment consists primarily of
    the operations of Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC (APS). APS
    owns and operates a 21 mile pipeline located in New
    Orleans, Louisiana. This



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

pipeline is used primarily to aggregate gas supply for our
    regulated natural gas distribution division in Louisiana and for
    AEM, but also provides limited third party transportation
    services.

APS also engages in asset optimization activities whereby it
    seeks to maximize the economic value associated with the storage
    and transportation capacity it owns or controls. Certain of
    these arrangements are asset management plans with regulated
    affiliates of the Company which have been approved by applicable
    state regulatory commissions. Generally, these asset management
    plans require APS to share with our regulated customers a
    portion of the profits earned from these arrangements.

Further, APS owns or has an interest in underground storage
    fields in Kentucky and Louisiana that are used to reduce the
    need of our natural gas distribution divisions to contract for
    pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation

— The accompanying
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Atmos
    Energy Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
    material intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Basis of comparison

— Certain prior-year
    amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year
    presentation.

Use of estimates

— The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The most significant
    estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, legal and
    environmental accruals, insurance accruals, pension and
    postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes, asset
    retirement obligations, impairment of long-lived assets, risk
    management and trading activities, fair value measurements and
    the valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets
    and other long-lived assets. Actual results could differ from
    those estimates.

Regulation

— Our natural gas distribution and
    regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to
    regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of
    accounting records and various other matters by the respective
    regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. Our
    accounting policies recognize the financial effects of the
    ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various
    regulatory commissions. Accounting principles generally accepted
    in the United States require cost-based, rate-regulated entities
    that meet certain criteria to reflect the authorized recovery of
    costs due to regulatory decisions in their financial statements.
    As a result, certain costs are permitted to be capitalized
    rather than expensed because they can be recovered through rates.

We record regulatory assets as a component of other current
    assets and deferred charges and other assets for costs that have
    been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates
    is considered probable. Regulatory liabilities are recorded
    either on the face of the balance sheet or as a component of
    current liabilities, deferred income taxes or deferred credits
    and other liabilities when it is probable that revenues will



ATMOS

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers
    through the ratemaking process. Significant regulatory assets
    and liabilities as of September 30, 2010 and 2009 included
    the following:

Currently, authorized rates do not include a return on certain
    of our merger and integration costs; however, we recover the
    amortization of these costs. Merger and integration costs, net,
    are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated
    useful lives ranging up to 20 years. Environmental costs
    have been deferred to be included in future rate filings in
    accordance with rulings received from various state regulatory
    commissions. During the fiscal years ended September 30,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized $0.4 million,
    $0.4 million and $0.4 million in amortization expense
    related to these costs.

Revenue recognition

— Sales of natural gas to
    our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly
    basis; however, the billing cycle periods for certain classes of
    customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods
    used for financial reporting purposes. We follow the revenue
    accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution
    segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to
    customers, but not yet billed under the cycle billing method,
    are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to
    expense. During the year ended September 30, 2009 we
    recognized a non-recurring $7.6 million increase in gross
    profit associated with a one-time update to our estimate for gas
    delivered to customers but not yet billed, resulting from base
    rate changes in several jurisdictions.

On occasion, we are permitted to implement new rates that have
    not been formally approved by our state regulatory commissions,
    which are subject to refund. As permitted by accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States, we recognize
    this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be
    refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which
    the rates were implemented.

Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for
    increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through
    purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas cost
    adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of
    recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without
    filing a rate case to address all of the utility company’s
    non-gas costs. There is no gross profit generated through
    purchased



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

gas cost adjustments, but they provide a

dollar-for-dollar

offset to increases or decreases in our natural gas distribution
    segment’s gas costs. The effects of these purchased gas
    cost adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on
    our balance sheet.

Operating revenues for our natural gas marketing segment and the
    associated carrying value of natural gas inventory (inclusive of
    storage costs) are recognized when we sell the gas and
    physically deliver it to our customers. Operating revenues
    include realized gains and losses arising from the settlement of
    financial instruments used in our natural gas marketing
    activities and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes
    in the fair value of natural gas inventory designated as a
    hedged item in a fair value hedge and the associated financial
    instruments. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, we included unrealized gains (losses) on open
    contracts of $(10.8) million, $(28.4) million and
    $25.5 million as a component of natural gas marketing
    revenues.

Operating revenues for our regulated transmission and storage
    and pipeline, storage and other segments are recognized in the
    period in which actual volumes are transported and storage
    services are provided.

Cash and cash equivalents

— We consider all
    highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
    months or less to be cash equivalents.

Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts

— Accounts receivable arise from natural gas sales
    to residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and other
    customers. For the majority of our receivables, we establish an
    allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collection
    experience. On certain other receivables where we are aware of a
    specific customer’s inability or reluctance to pay, we
    record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to
    reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably
    expect to collect. However, if circumstances change, our
    estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be
    affected. Circumstances which could affect our estimates
    include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, the
    level of natural gas prices, customer deposits and general
    economic conditions. Accounts are written off once they are
    deemed to be uncollectible.

Gas stored underground

— Our gas stored
    underground is comprised of natural gas injected into storage to
    support the winter season withdrawals for our natural gas
    distribution operations and natural gas held by our natural gas
    marketing and other nonregulated subsidiaries to conduct their
    operations. The average cost method is used for all our
    regulated operations, except for certain jurisdictions in the
    Kentucky/Mid-States Division, where it is valued on the

first-in

first-out method basis, in accordance with regulatory
    requirements. Our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage
    and other segments utilize the average cost method; however,
    most of this inventory is hedged and is therefore reported at
    fair value at the end of each month. Gas in storage that is
    retained as cushion gas to maintain reservoir pressure is
    classified as property, plant and equipment and is valued at
    cost.

Regulated property, plant and equipment

— Regulated property, plant and equipment is
    stated at original cost, net of contributions in aid of
    construction. The cost of additions includes direct construction
    costs, payroll related costs (taxes, pensions and other fringe
    benefits), administrative and general costs and an allowance for
    funds used during construction. The allowance for funds used
    during construction represents the estimated cost of funds used
    to finance the construction of major projects and are
    capitalized in the rate base for ratemaking purposes when the
    completed projects are placed in service. Interest expense of
    $3.9 million, $4.9 million and $2.9 million was
    capitalized in 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Major renewals, including replacement pipe, and betterments that
    are recoverable under our regulatory rate base are capitalized
    while the costs of maintenance and repairs that are not
    recoverable through rates are charged to expense as incurred.
    The costs of large projects are accumulated in construction in
    progress until the project is completed. When the project is
    completed, tested and placed in service, the balance is
    transferred to the regulated plant in service account included
    in the rate base and depreciation begins.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Regulated property, plant and equipment is depreciated at
    various rates on a straight-line basis. These rates are approved
    by our regulatory commissions and are comprised of two
    components: one based on average service life and one based on
    cost of removal. Accordingly, we recognize our cost of removal
    expense as a component of depreciation expense. The related cost
    of removal accrual is reflected as a regulatory liability on the
    consolidated balance sheet. At the time property, plant and
    equipment is retired, removal expenses less salvage, are charged
    to the regulatory cost of removal accrual. The composite
    depreciation rate was 3.5 percent, 3.8 percent and
    3.7 percent for the fiscal years ended September 30,
    2010, 2009 and 2008.

Nonregulated property, plant and equipment

— Nonregulated property, plant and equipment is
    stated at cost. Depreciation is generally computed on the
    straight-line method for financial reporting purposes based upon
    estimated useful lives ranging from three to 41 years.

Asset retirement obligations

— We record a
    liability at fair value for an asset retirement obligation when
    the legal obligation to retire the asset has been incurred with
    an offsetting increase to the carrying value of the related
    asset. Accretion of the asset retirement obligation due to the
    passage of time is recorded as an operating expense.

As of September 30, 2010 and 2009, we recorded asset
    retirement obligations of $11.4 million and
    $13.0 million. Additionally, we recorded $3.8 million
    and $3.9 million of asset retirement costs as a component
    of property, plant and equipment that will be depreciated over
    the remaining life of the underlying associated assets.

We believe we have a legal obligation to retire our natural gas
    storage facilities. However, we have not recognized an asset
    retirement obligation associated with our storage facilities
    because we are not able to determine the settlement date of this
    obligation as we do not anticipate taking our storage facilities
    out of service permanently. Therefore, we cannot reasonably
    estimate the fair value of this obligation.

Impairment of long-lived assets

— We
    periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have
    occurred that indicate that other long-lived assets may not be
    recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant
    revision. When such events or circumstances are present, we
    assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining
    whether the carrying value will be recovered through the
    expected future cash flows. In the event the sum of the expected
    future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less
    than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss equal
    to the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair
    value is recorded.

Goodwill and intangible assets

— We annually
    evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second
    fiscal quarter or more frequently as impairment indicators
    arise. We use a present value technique based on discounted cash
    flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. These
    calculations are dependent on several subjective factors
    including the timing of future cash flows, future growth rates
    and the discount rate. An impairment charge is recognized if the
    carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its
    fair value.

Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives of
    10 years. These assets are reviewed for impairment as
    impairment indicators arise. When such events or circumstances
    are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets
    by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered
    through the expected future cash flows. In the event the sum of
    the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the
    asset is less than the carrying value of the asset, an
    impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset’s carrying
    value over its fair value is recorded. No impairment has been
    recognized.

Marketable securities

— As of
    September 30, 2010 and 2009, all of our marketable
    securities were classified as

available-for-sale.

In accordance with the authoritative accounting standards, these
    securities are reported at market value with unrealized gains
    and losses shown as a component of accumulated other

basis for impairment, taking into consideration the fund’s
    purpose, volatility and current returns. If a determination is
    made that a decline in fair value is other than temporary, the
    related fund is written down to its estimated fair value.

Due to the deterioration of the financial markets in late
    calendar 2008 and early calendar 2009 and the uncertainty of a
    full recovery of these investments given the then current
    economic environment, we recorded a $5.4 million noncash
    charge to impair certain

available-for-sale

investments during fiscal 2009.

Financial instruments and hedging activities

— We currently use financial instruments to
    mitigate commodity price risk. Additionally, we periodically use
    financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. The
    objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have
    been tailored to our regulated and nonregulated businesses.
    Currently, we utilize financial instruments in our natural gas
    distribution, natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and
    other segments. The objectives and strategies for the use of
    financial instruments are discussed in Note 4.

We record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet
    at fair value

,

with changes in fair value ultimately
    recorded in the income statement. These financial instruments
    are reported as risk management assets and liabilities and are
    classified as current or noncurrent other assets or liabilities
    based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying
    financial instrument.

The timing of when changes in fair value of our financial
    instruments are recorded in the income statement depends on
    whether the financial instrument has been designated and
    qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory
    rulings require a different accounting treatment. Changes in
    fair value for financial instruments that do not meet one of
    these criteria are recognized in the income statement as they
    occur.

Financial
    Instruments Associated with Commodity Price Risk

In our natural gas distribution segment, the costs associated
    with and the gains and losses arising from the use of financial
    instruments to mitigate commodity price risk are included in our
    purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms in accordance with
    regulatory requirements. Therefore, changes in the fair value of
    these financial instruments are initially recorded as a
    component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the
    consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas
    cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and
    recognized in revenue in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, there is
    no earnings impact on our natural gas distribution segment as a
    result of the use of financial instruments.

In our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other
    segments, we have designated the natural gas inventory held by
    these operating segments as the hedged item in a fair-value
    hedge. This inventory is marked to market at the end of each
    month based on the Gas Daily index, with changes in fair value
    recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the
    period of change. The financial instruments associated with this
    natural gas inventory have been designated as fair-value hedges
    and are marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price
    with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or
    losses in revenue in the period of change. Changes in the
    spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the
    financial hedges designated against our physical inventory
    (NYMEX) and the market (spot) prices used to value our physical
    storage (Gas Daily) result in unrealized margins until the
    underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial
    instruments are settled. Once the gas is withdrawn and the
    financial instruments are settled, the previously unrealized
    margins associated with these net positions are realized. We
    have elected to exclude this spot/forward differential for
    purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fair-value
    hedges. Over time, we expect gains and losses on the sale of
    storage gas inventory to be offset by gains and losses on the
    fair-value hedges, resulting in the realization of the economic
    gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the
    original transaction.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In our natural gas marketing segment, we have elected to treat
    fixed-price forward contracts to deliver natural gas as normal
    purchases and normal sales. As such, these deliveries are
    recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with our revenue
    recognition policy. Financial instruments used to mitigate the
    commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been
    designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and
    sales at indexed prices. Accordingly, unrealized gains and
    losses on these open financial instruments are recorded as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and are
    recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged
    volumes are sold. Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred,
    is reported as a component of revenue.

Gains and losses from hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in
    the income statement. Fair value and cash flow hedge
    ineffectiveness arising from natural gas market price
    differences between the locations of the hedged inventory and
    the delivery location specified in the financial instruments is
    referred to as basis ineffectiveness. Ineffectiveness arising
    from changes in the fair value of the fair value hedges due to
    changes in the difference between the spot price and the futures
    price, as well as the difference between the timing of the
    settlement of the futures and the valuation of the underlying
    physical commodity is referred to as timing ineffectiveness.

In our natural gas marketing segment, we also utilize master
    netting agreements with significant counterparties that allow us
    to offset gains and losses arising from financial instruments
    that may be settled in cash with gains and losses arising from
    financial instruments that may be settled with the physical
    commodity. Assets and liabilities from risk management
    activities, as well as accounts receivable and payable, reflect
    the master netting agreements in place. Additionally, the
    accounting guidance for master netting arrangements requires us
    to include the fair value of cash collateral or the obligation
    to return cash in the amounts that have been netted under master
    netting agreements used to offset gains and losses arising from
    financial instruments. As of September 30, 2010 and 2009,
    the Company netted $24.9 million and $11.7 million of
    cash held in margin accounts into its current risk management
    assets and liabilities.

Financial
    Instruments Associated with Interest Rate Risk

We periodically manage interest rate risk, typically when we
    issue new or refinance existing long-term debt. In fiscal 2010
    and in prior years, we entered into Treasury lock agreements to
    fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated
    with anticipated financings. We designated these Treasury lock
    agreements as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction at
    the time the agreements were executed. Accordingly, unrealized
    gains and losses associated with the Treasury lock agreements
    were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss). When the Treasury locks were settled, the
    realized gain or loss was recorded as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss) and is being recognized as a
    component of interest expense over the life of the related
    financing arrangement.

Fair Value Measurements —

We report certain
    assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the
    price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
    transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants at the measurement date (exit price). We primarily
    use quoted market prices and other observable market pricing
    information in valuing our financial assets and liabilities and
    minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our
    measurements.

Prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to
    determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities
    recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. Within our
    nonregulated operations, we utilize a mid-market pricing
    convention (the mid-point between the bid and ask prices) as a
    practical expedient for determining fair value measurement, as
    permitted under current accounting standards. Values derived
    from these sources reflect the market in which transactions
    involving these financial instruments are executed. We utilize
    models and other valuation methods to determine fair value when
    external sources are not available. Values are adjusted to
    reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our
    positions over a reasonable period of time under then-current
    market conditions. We believe the market prices and models used
    to value



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

these assets and liabilities represent the best information
    available with respect to closing exchange and

over-the-counter

quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the
    assets and liabilities.

Fair-value estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and
    the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved. Our
    counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and
    major energy companies. This concentration of counterparties may
    materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from
    market, economic or regulatory conditions. Adverse developments
    in the last few years in the global financial and credit markets
    have periodically made it more difficult and more expensive for
    companies to access the short-term capital markets, which may
    negatively impact the creditworthiness of our counterparties.
    Any further tightening of the credit markets could cause more of
    our counterparties to fail to perform. We seek to minimize
    counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their
    financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral
    requirements under certain circumstances.

Amounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially
    significant volatility based upon changes in market prices, the
    valuation of the portfolio of our contracts, maturity and
    settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions,
    each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our
    financial instruments. We believe the market prices and models
    used to value these financial instruments represent the best
    information available with respect to closing exchange and

over-the-counter

quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the
    contracts. Values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact
    of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable
    period of time under then current market conditions.

Authoritative accounting literature establishes a fair value
    hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value
    based on observable and unobservable data. The hierarchy
    categorizes the inputs into three levels, with the highest
    priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the
    lowest priority given to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The
    levels of the hierarchy are described below:

Level 1

— Represents unadjusted quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An
    active market for the asset or liability is defined as a market
    in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with
    sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information
    on an ongoing basis. Our Level 1 measurements consist
    primarily of exchange-traded financial instruments, gas stored
    underground that has been designated as the hedged item in a
    fair value hedge and our

available-for-sale

securities. The Level 1 measurements for investments in our
    Master Trust, Supplemental Executive Benefit Plan and
    postretirement benefit plan consist primarily of exchange-traded
    financial instruments.

Level 2

— Represents pricing inputs other
    than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are either
    directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability as
    of the reporting date. These inputs are derived principally
    from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Our
    Level 2 measurements primarily consist of
    non-exchange-traded financial instruments, such as

over-the-counter

options and swaps where market data for pricing is observable.
    The Level 2 measurements for investments in our Master
    Trust, Supplemental Executive Benefit Plan and postretirement
    benefit plan consist primarily of non-exchange traded financial
    instruments such as common collective trusts and investments in
    limited partnerships.

Level 3

— Represents generally
    unobservable pricing inputs which are developed based on the
    best information available, including our own internal data, in
    situations where there is little if any market activity for the
    asset or liability at the measurement date. The pricing inputs
    utilized reflect what a market participant would use to
    determine fair value. Our Master Trust has investments in real
    estate that qualify as Level 3 fair value measurements.
    Currently, we have no other assets or liabilities recorded at
    fair value that would qualify for Level 3 reporting.

Pension and other postretirement plans

—
    Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are
    determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous
    assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan
    assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed
    discount rates and current



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

demographic and actuarial mortality data. Through fiscal 2008,
    we reviewed the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension
    and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities annually
    based upon a June 30 measurement date. To comply with the new
    measurement date requirements established by the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and incorporated into
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
    effective October 1, 2008, we changed our measurement date
    from June 30 to our fiscal year end, September 30. This
    change is more fully discussed in Note 8. The assumed
    discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that
    generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs
    and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health
    care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally
    have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan
    costs and liabilities.

In August 2010, the Board of Directors of Atmos Energy approved
    a proposal to close the Pension Account Plan (PAP) to new
    participants, effective October 1, 2010. Employees
    participating in the PAP as of October 1, 2010 will be
    allowed to make a one-time election to migrate from the PAP into
    our defined contribution plan which has been enhanced, effective
    January 1, 2011. Participants who choose to remain in the
    PAP will continue to earn benefits and interest allocations with
    no changes to their existing benefits.

The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the
    actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement
    obligation and net pension and postretirement cost. When
    establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality
    corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace
    that are suitable for settling the obligations, changes in those
    rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is
    derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with
    currently available high quality corporate bonds.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in
    calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the
    annual pension and postretirement plan cost. We estimate the
    expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond
    returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of
    active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset
    rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the
    guidance from our investment advisors in making a final
    determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the
    extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the
    course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate,
    that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan cost is
    not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases
    future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of
    approximately ten to twelve years.

The market-related value of our plan assets represents the fair
    market value of the plan assets, adjusted to smooth out
    short-term market fluctuations over a five-year period. The use
    of this calculation will delay the impact of current market
    fluctuations on the pension expense for the period.

We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in
    determining our annual postretirement net cost based upon our
    actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently
    enacted legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed
    rate of retirement is estimated based upon the annual review of
    our participant census information as of the measurement date.

Income taxes

— Income taxes are provided based
    on the liability method, which results in income tax assets and
    liabilities arising from temporary differences. Temporary
    differences are differences between the tax bases of assets and
    liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial
    statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in
    future years. The liability method requires the effect of tax
    rate changes on current and accumulated deferred income taxes to
    be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted.
    The liability method also requires that deferred tax assets be
    reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than
    not that the assets will be realized.

The Company may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax
    positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the
    tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
    authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The
    tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a
    position should be measured based on the largest benefit that
    has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized
    upon

settlement with the taxing authorities. We recognize accrued
    interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of
    interest expense. We recognize penalties related to unrecognized
    tax benefits as a component of miscellaneous income (expense) in
    accordance with regulatory requirements.

Stock-based compensation plans

— We maintain
    the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan that provides for the granting
    of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock
    appreciation rights, bonus stock, time-lapse restricted stock,
    performance-based restricted stock units and stock units to
    officers, division presidents and other key employees.
    Non-employee directors are also eligible to receive stock-based
    compensation under the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The
    objectives of this plan include attracting and retaining the
    best personnel, providing for additional performance incentives
    and promoting our success by providing employees with the
    opportunity to acquire our common stock.

Accumulated other comprehensive loss

    Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, as of
    September 30, 2010 and 2009, consisted of the following

    Note 6, no events occurred subsequent to the balance sheet
    date that would require recognition or disclosure in the
    financial statements.

Recent accounting pronouncements

— During the
    year ended September 30, 2010, six new accounting standards
    became applicable to the Company. Except as indicated below, the
    adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on
    our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
    There were no other significant changes to our accounting
    policies during the year ended September 30, 2010.

The determination of participating securities in the basic
    earnings per share calculation

- The Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance related to determining
    whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions
    are considered participating securities. The FASB determined
    that non-vested share-based payments with a nonforfeitable right
    to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating
    securities and, as a result, companies with these types of
    participating securities must use the two-class method to
    compute earnings per share. Based on this guidance, the Company
    is required to calculate earnings per share using the two-class
    method and will include non-vested restricted stock and
    restricted stock units for which vesting is only predicated upon
    the passage of time in the basic earnings per share calculation.
    Non-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units for which
    vesting is predicated, in part upon the achievement of specified
    performance targets, continue to be excluded from the
    calculation of earnings per share. Although the provisions of
    this standard were effective for us as of October 1, 2009,
    prior-period earnings per share data must be recalculated and
    adjusted accordingly. The calculation of basic and diluted
    earnings per share pursuant

to the two-class method is presented in Note 10. The

Fair value measurements of plan assets of a defined benefit
    pension or other postretirement plan —

This
    guidance requires employers to disclose annually information
    about fair value measurements of the assets of a defined benefit
    pension or other postretirement plan in a manner similar to the
    requirements established for financial and non-financial assets.
    The objectives of the required disclosures are to provide users
    of financial statements with an understanding of how investment
    allocation decisions are made, the major categories of plan
    assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair
    value of plan assets and significant concentrations of risk
    within plan assets. These disclosures appear in Note 8 for
    the year ended September 30, 2010.

Measurement of liabilities at fair value —

This
    guidance requires that, effective October 1, 2009, when a
    quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is
    not available, we will be required to measure fair value using a
    valuation technique that uses quoted prices of similar
    liabilities, quoted prices of identical or similar liabilities
    when traded as assets, or another valuation technique that is
    consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles (GAAP), such as the income or market approach.
    Additionally, when estimating the fair value of a liability, we
    will not be required to include a separate input or adjustment
    to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that
    prevents our transfer of the liability. The adoption of this
    guidance did not impact our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Business combination accounting

— Effective
    October 1, 2009, this new pronouncement established new
    principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business
    combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements
    the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and
    any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition
    date fair value. This update significantly changes the
    accounting for business combinations in a number of areas,
    including the treatment of contingent consideration,
    preacquisition contingencies, transaction costs and
    restructuring costs. In addition, under the new guidelines,
    changes in an acquired entity’s deferred tax assets and
    uncertain tax positions after the measurement period will impact
    current period income tax expense.

Accounting and reporting for minority interests —

In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance related to the
    accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be
    recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a
    component of equity. This new consolidation method significantly
    changed the accounting for transactions with minority interest
    holders beginning October 1, 2009. As of September 30,
    2010, Atmos Energy did not have any transactions with minority
    interest holders.

Fair value disclosures —

The FASB issued
    guidance that requires new disclosures surrounding fair value
    measurements to enhance the existing disclosure requirements
    including 1) information about transfers in and out of
    Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements as well as
    a detailed reconciliation of activity in Level 3 fair value
    measurements; 2) a more detailed level of disaggregation
    for each class of assets and liabilities; and 3) a
    requirement to disclose information about the valuation
    techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both
    recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements that fall in
    either Level 2 or Level 3. The new disclosures and
    clarifications of existing disclosures became effective for us
    on January 1, 2010, except for the disclosures related to
    the detailed reconciliation of Level 3 fair value
    measurements, which will become effective for us on
    October 1, 2011. As a result of adopting this standard,
    beginning in our second fiscal quarter we added a disclosure
    about the valuation techniques and inputs we used to measure
    fair value for our Level 2 recurring and nonrecurring fair
    value measurements, which is included in Note 5. As of
    September 30, 2010, we did not have any Level 3 fair
    value measurements. Our Master Trust holds an investment in real
    estate which is classified as a Level 3 fair value
    measurement at September 30, 2010.

Financial
    Instruments

We currently use financial instruments to mitigate commodity
    price risk. Additionally, we periodically utilize financial
    instruments to manage interest rate risk. The objectives and
    strategies for using financial instruments have been tailored to
    our regulated and nonregulated businesses. Currently, we utilize
    financial instruments in our natural gas distribution, natural
    gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments. However,
    our pipeline, storage and other segment uses financial
    instruments acquired from AEM on the same terms that AEM
    received from an independent counterparty. On a consolidated
    basis, these financial instruments are reported in the natural
    gas marketing segment.

As discussed in Note 2, we report our financial instruments
    as risk management assets and liabilities, each of which is
    classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated
    settlement date of the underlying financial instrument. The
    following table shows the fair values of our risk management
    assets and liabilities by segment at September 30, 2010 and
    2009:

Regulated
    Commodity Risk Management Activities

Although our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms
    essentially insulate our natural gas distribution segment from
    commodity price risk, our natural gas distribution customers are
    exposed to the effects of volatile natural gas prices. We manage
    this exposure through a combination of physical storage,
    fixed-price forward contracts and financial instruments,
    primarily

over-the-counter

swap and option contracts, in an effort to minimize the impact
    of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the
    winter heating season.

Our natural gas distribution gas supply department is
    responsible for executing this segment’s commodity risk
    management activities in conformity with regulatory
    requirements. In jurisdictions where we are permitted to
    mitigate commodity price risk through financial instruments, the
    relevant regulatory authorities may establish the level of
    heating season gas purchases that can be hedged. If the
    regulatory authority does not establish this level, we seek to
    hedge between 25 and 50 percent of anticipated heating
    season gas purchases using financial instruments. For the

2009-2010

heating season, in the jurisdictions where we are permitted to
    utilize financial instruments, we hedged approximately
    29 percent, or 26.9 Bcf of the winter flowing gas
    requirements at a weighted average cost of approximately $6.38
    per Mcf. We have not designated these financial instruments as
    hedges.

We currently do not manage commodity price risk with financial
    instruments in our regulated transmission and storage segment.

Nonregulated
    Commodity Risk Management Activities

Our natural gas marketing segment, through AEM, aggregates and
    purchases gas supply, arranges transportation

and/or

storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers
    at competitive prices. To facilitate this process, we utilize
    proprietary and customer-owned transportation and storage assets
    to provide the various services our customers’ request.

We also perform asset optimization activities in both our
    natural gas marketing segment and pipeline, storage and other
    segment. Through asset optimization activities, we seek to
    enhance our gross profit by maximizing the economic value
    associated with the storage and transportation capacity we own
    or control. We attempt to meet this objective by engaging in
    natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and
    profit from the pricing differences that occur over time. We
    purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial
    instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit
    margin. Through the use of transportation and storage services
    and financial instruments, we also seek to capture gross profit
    margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences that exist
    in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that
    occur over time. Over time, gains and losses on the sale of
    storage gas inventory should be offset by gains and losses on
    the financial instruments, resulting in the realization of the
    economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we
    structured the original transaction.

As a result of these activities, our nonregulated operations are
    exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of
    natural gas. We manage our exposure to such risks through a
    combination of physical storage and financial instruments,
    including futures,

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with
    counterparties. Future contracts provide the right to buy or
    sell the commodity at a fixed price in the future. Option
    contracts provide the right, but not the requirement, to buy or
    sell the commodity at a fixed price. Swap contracts require
    receipt of payment for the commodity based on the difference
    between a fixed price and the market price on the settlement
    date.

We use financial instruments, designated as cash flow hedges of
    anticipated purchases and sales at index prices, to mitigate the
    commodity price risk in our natural gas marketing segment
    associated with deliveries under fixed-priced forward contracts
    to deliver gas to customers. These financial instruments have
    maturity dates ranging from one to 59 months. We use
    financial instruments, designated as fair value hedges, to hedge



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

our natural gas inventory used in our asset optimization
    activities in our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage
    and other segments.

Also, in our natural gas marketing segment, we use storage swaps
    and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage
    opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the
    original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural
    gas inventory, basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic
    value of our fixed price and storage books and various

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options. These financial instruments have
    not been designated as hedges.

Our nonregulated risk management activities are controlled
    through various risk management policies and procedures. Our
    Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for our
    nonregulated risk management limits and policies. Our risk
    management committee, comprised of corporate and business unit
    officers, is responsible for establishing and enforcing our
    nonregulated risk management policies and procedures.

Under our risk management policies, we seek to match our
    financial instrument positions to our physical storage positions
    as well as our expected current and future sales and purchase
    obligations in order to maintain no open positions at the end of
    each trading day. The determination of our net open position as
    of any day, however, requires us to make assumptions as to
    future circumstances, including the use of gas by our customers
    in relation to our anticipated storage and market positions.
    Because the price risk associated with any net open position at
    the end of each day may increase if the assumptions are not
    realized, we review these assumptions as part of our daily
    monitoring activities. Our operations can also be affected by
    intraday fluctuations of gas prices, since the price of natural
    gas purchased or sold for future delivery earlier in the day may
    not be hedged until later in the day. At times, limited net open
    positions related to our existing and anticipated commitments
    may occur. At the close of business on September 30, 2010,
    AEH had net open positions (including existing storage and
    related financial contracts) of 0.1 Bcf.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management Activities

We periodically manage interest rate risk by entering into
    Treasury lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of
    the interest cost associated with anticipated financings.

We intend to refinance our $350 million unsecured
    7.375% Senior Notes that will mature in May 2011 through
    the issuance of

30-year

unsecured senior notes in June 2011. Additionally, we anticipate
    issuing $250 million of 30-year unsecured senior notes in
    November 2011 to fund our capital expenditure program. In
    September 2010, we entered into five Treasury lock agreements to
    fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated
    with the anticipated issuances of these senior notes. We
    designated all of these Treasury locks as cash flow hedges of an
    anticipated transaction.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In fiscal years 2004 through 2009, we entered into several
    Treasury lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of
    the interest cost of financing the issuance of long-term debt
    and senior notes. In October 2004, we settled four Treasury lock
    agreements associated with the permanent financing of our TXU
    Gas acquisition with a net $43.8 million payment to the
    counterparties. In June 2007, we settled a Treasury lock
    agreement associated with the issuance of our $250 million
    6.35% Senior notes with the receipt of $2.9 million
    from the counterparties, and in March 2009 we settled an
    agreement associated with the issuance of our $450 million
    8.50% senior notes with the receipt of $1.9 million
    from the counterparty.

The gains and losses realized upon settlement were recorded as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and
    are being recognized as a component of interest expense over the
    life of the associated notes from the date of settlement.

Impact of

The following tables present the impact that financial
    instruments had on our consolidated income statement, by
    operating segment, as applicable, for the years ended
    September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Hedge ineffectiveness for our natural gas marketing and pipeline
    storage and other segments is recorded as a component of
    unrealized gross profit and primarily results from differences
    in the location and timing of the derivative instrument and the
    hedged item. Hedge ineffectiveness could materially affect our
    results of operations for the reported period. For the years
    ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 we recognized a
    gain arising from fair value and cash flow hedge ineffectiveness
    of $51.8 million, $6.4 million and $46.0 million.

Basis ineffectiveness arises from natural gas market price
    differences between the locations of the hedged inventory and
    the delivery location specified in the hedge instruments. Timing
    ineffectiveness arises due to changes in the difference between
    the spot price and the futures price, as well as the difference
    between the timing of the settlement of the futures and the
    valuation of the underlying physical commodity. As the commodity
    contract nears the settlement date, spot to forward price
    differences should converge, which should reduce or eliminate
    the impact of this ineffectiveness on revenue.

Financial
    Instruments Not Designated as Hedges

The impact of financial instruments that have not been
    designated as hedges on our consolidated income statements for
    the years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is
    presented below. Note that this presentation does not reflect
    the expected gains or losses arising from the underlying
    physical transactions associated with these financial
    instruments. Therefore, this presentation is not indicative of
    the economic gross profit we realized when the underlying
    physical and financial transactions were settled.

As discussed above, financial instruments used in our natural
    gas distribution segment are not designated as hedges. However,
    there is no earnings impact on our natural gas distribution
    segment as a result of the use of these financial instruments
    because the gains and losses arising from the use of these
    financial instruments are recognized in the consolidated
    statement of income as a component of purchased gas cost when
    the related costs are recovered through our rates and recognized
    in revenue. Accordingly, the impact of these financial
    instruments is excluded from this presentation.

Fair
    Value Measurements

We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is
    defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or
    paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
    market participants at the measurement date (exit price). We
    record cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
    accounts payable at carrying value, which substantially
    approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these
    assets and liabilities. For other financial assets and
    liabilities, we primarily use quoted market prices and other
    observable market pricing information to minimize the use of
    unobservable pricing inputs in our measurements when determining
    fair value. The methods used to determine fair value for our
    assets and liabilities are fully described in Note 2.



ATMOS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Effective October 1, 2009, the authoritative guidance
    related to nonrecurring fair value measurements became effective
    for us with respect to asset retirement obligations, most
    nonfinancial assets and liabilities that may be acquired in a
    business combination and impairment analyses performed for
    nonfinancial assets. The adoption of the FASB’s fair value
    guidance for the reporting of these nonrecurring fair value
    measurements did not have a material impact on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows for the year ended
    September 30, 2010.

Fair value measurements also apply to the valuation of our
    pension and post-retirement plan assets. The fair value of these
    assets is presented in Note 8 below.

    Instruments

The classification of our fair value measurements requires
    judgment regarding the degree to which market data are
    observable or corroborated by observable market data. The
    following tables summarize, by level within the fair value
    hierarchy, our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at
    fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2010
    and 2009. As required under authoritative accounting literature,
    assets and liabilities are categorized in their entirety based
    on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
    value measurement.

Other
    Fair Value Measures

In addition to the financial instruments above, we have several
    financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities subject to
    fair value measures. These financial assets and liabilities
    include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
    payable and debt. The nonfinancial assets and liabilities
    include asset retirement obligations and pension and
    post-retirement plan assets. As noted above, fair value
    disclosures for pension and post-retirement plan assets became
    effective for us on October 1, 2009. These disclosures are
    included in Note 8. We record cash and cash equivalents,
    accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt at carrying
    value. For cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
    accounts payable, we consider carrying value to materially
    approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these
    assets and liabilities.

Our debt is recorded at carrying value. The fair value of our
    debt is determined using third party market value quotations.

Short-term
    debt

Our short-term borrowing requirements are affected by the
    seasonal nature of the natural gas business. Changes in the
    price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to
    supply our customers’ needs could significantly affect our
    borrowing requirements. Our short-term borrowings typically
    reach their highest levels in the winter months.

We finance our short-term borrowing requirements through a
    combination of a $566.7 million commercial paper program
    and four committed revolving credit facilities with third-party
    lenders that provide approximately $1.2 billion of working
    capital funding. At September 30, 2010 and 2009, there was
    $126.1 million and $72.6 million outstanding under our
    commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2010 our
    commercial paper had maturities of less than one week with
    interest rates of 0.34 percent. We also use intercompany
    credit facilities to supplement the funding provided by these
    third-party committed credit facilities. These facilities are
    described in greater detail below.

Regulated
    Operations

We fund our regulated operations as needed, primarily through
    our commercial paper program and three committed revolving
    credit facilities with third-party lenders that provide
    approximately $800 million of working capital funding. The
    first facility is a five-year $566.7 million unsecured
    facility, expiring December 15, 2011, that bears interest
    at a base rate or at a LIBOR-based rate for the applicable
    interest period, plus a spread ranging from 0.30 percent to
    0.75 percent, based on the Company’s credit ratings.
    This credit facility serves as a backup liquidity facility for
    our commercial paper program. At September 30, 2010, there
    were no borrowings under this facility, but we had
    $126.1 million of commercial paper outstanding leaving
    $440.6 million available.

The second facility is a $200 million unsecured

364-day

facility expiring October 22, 2010, that bears interest at
    a base rate or at a LIBOR-based rate for the applicable interest
    period, plus a spread ranging from 1.75 percent to
    3.00 percent, based on the Company’s credit ratings.
    At September 30, 2010, there were no borrowings outstanding
    under this facility. In October 2010, this facility was replaced
    with a $200 million

180-day

facility on substantially the same terms, which expires in April
    2011.

The third facility is a $25 million unsecured facility that
    bears interest at a daily negotiated rate, generally based on
    the Federal Funds rate plus a variable margin. At
    September 30, 2010, there were no borrowings outstanding
    under this facility.

The availability of funds under these credit facilities is
    subject to conditions specified in the respective credit
    agreements, all of which we currently satisfy. These conditions
    include our compliance with financial covenants and the
    continued accuracy of representations and warranties contained
    in these agreements. We are required by the financial covenants
    in each of these facilities to maintain, at the end of each
    fiscal quarter, a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of
    no greater than 70 percent. At September 30, 2010, our
    total-debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, as defined, was
    54 percent. In addition, both the interest margin over the
    Eurodollar rate and the fee that we pay on unused amounts under
    each of these facilities are subject to adjustment depending
    upon our credit ratings.

In addition to these third-party facilities, our regulated
    operations have a $200 million intercompany revolving
    credit facility with AEH. This facility bears interest at the
    lower of (i) the one-month LIBOR rate plus
    0.45 percent or (ii) the marginal borrowing rate
    available to the Company on the date of borrowing. The marginal
    borrowing rate is defined as the lower of (i) a rate based
    upon the lower of the Prime Rate or the Eurodollar rate under
    the five year revolving credit facility, (ii) a rate based
    upon the lower of the Prime Rate or the Eurodollar rate under
    the

364-day

revolving credit facility or (iii) the lowest rate
    outstanding under the commercial paper program. Applicable state
    regulatory commissions have approved our use of this facility

through December 31, 2011 for up to $350 million.
    There was $132.4 million outstanding under this facility at
    September 30, 2010.

Nonregulated
    Operations

On December 10, 2009, AEM and the participating banks
    amended and restated AEM’s $450 million committed
    revolving credit facility extending it to December 9, 2010.
    We are currently in discussions with our third-party lenders to
    replace this facility with a $200 million three-year
    facility with an accordion feature that could increase
    AEM’s borrowing capacity to $500 million.

AEM uses this facility primarily to issue letters of credit and,
    on a less frequent basis, to borrow funds for gas purchases and
    other working capital needs. At AEM’s option, borrowings
    made under the credit facility are based on a base rate or an
    offshore rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. The base
    rate is a floating rate equal to the higher of:
    (a) 0.50 percent per annum above the latest federal
    funds rate; (b) the per annum rate of interest established
    by BNP Paribas from time to time as its “prime rate”
    or “base rate” for U.S. dollar loans; (c) an
    offshore rate (based on LIBOR with a one-month interest period)
    as in effect from time to time; and (d) the “cost of
    funds” rate which is the cost of funds as reasonably
    determined by the administrative agent plus 0.50 percent.
    The offshore rate is a floating rate equal to the higher of
    (a) an offshore rate based upon LIBOR for the applicable
    interest period; and (b) a “cost of funds” rate
    referred to above. In the case of both base rate and offshore
    rate loans, the applicable margin ranges from 2.250 percent
    to 2.625 percent per annum, depending on the excess
    tangible net worth of AEM, as defined in the credit facility.
    This facility is collateralized by substantially all of the
    assets of AEM and is guaranteed by AEH.

At September 30, 2010, there were no borrowings outstanding
    under this credit facility. However, at September 30, 2010,
    AEM letters of credit totaling $22.9 million had been
    issued under the facility, which reduced the amount available by
    a corresponding amount. The amount available under this credit
    facility is also limited by various covenants, including
    covenants based on working capital. Under the most restrictive
    covenant, the amount available to AEM under this credit facility
    was $169.3 million at September 30, 2010.

AEM is required by the financial covenants in this facility to
    maintain a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth that
    does not exceed a maximum of 5 to 1. At September 30, 2010,
    AEM’s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth, as
    defined, was 0.94 to 1. Additionally, AEM must maintain minimum
    levels of net working capital and net worth ranging from
    $75 million to $112.5 million. As defined in the
    financial covenants, at September 30, 2010, AEM’s net
    working capital was $180.1 million and its tangible net
    worth was $194.6 million.

To supplement borrowings under this facility, as of
    September 30, 2010, AEM had a $300 million
    intercompany demand credit facility with AEH, which bears
    interest at the greater of (i) the one-month LIBOR rate
    plus 3.00 percent or (ii) the rate for AEM’s
    offshore borrowings under its committed credit facility plus
    0.75 percent. Amounts outstanding under this facility are
    subordinated to AEM’s committed credit facility. There were
    no borrowings outstanding under this facility at
    September 30, 2010.

Finally, as of September 30, 2010, AEH had a
    $200 million intercompany demand credit facility with AEC,
    which bore interest at greater of (i) the one-month LIBOR
    rate plus 3.00 percent or (ii) the rate for AEM’s
    offshore borrowings under its committed credit facility plus
    0.75 percent. In October 2010, we received regulatory
    approval to increase this facility, effective December 1,
    2010 through December 31, 2011, to $350 million with
    substantially the same terms. There were no borrowings
    outstanding under this facility at September 30, 2010.

    to time, up to $1.3 billion in common stock

and/or

debt
    securities available for issuance.

We received approvals from all requisite state regulatory

and/or

debt securities under the new shelf registration statement,
    including the carryforward of the $450 million of
    securities remaining available for issuance under our shelf
    registration statement filed with the SEC on March 23,
    2009. Due to certain restrictions imposed by one state
    regulatory commission on our ability to issue securities under
    the new registration statement, we will be able to issue a total
    of $950 million in debt securities and $350 million in
    equity securities.

Debt
    Covenants

In addition to the financial covenants described above, our
    credit facilities and public indentures contain usual and
    customary covenants for our business, including covenants
    substantially limiting liens, substantial asset sales and
    mergers.

Additionally, our public debt indentures relating to our senior
    notes and debentures, as well as our revolving credit
    agreements, each contain a default provision that is triggered
    if outstanding indebtedness arising out of any other credit
    agreements in amounts ranging from in excess of $15 million
    to in excess of $100 million becomes due by acceleration or
    is not paid at maturity.

Further, AEM’s credit agreement contains a cross-default
    provision whereby AEM would be in default if it defaults on
    other indebtedness, as defined, by at least $250 thousand in the
    aggregate.

Finally, AEM’s credit agreement contains a provision that
    would limit the amount of credit available if Atmos Energy were
    downgraded below an S&P rating of BBB and a Moody’s
    rating of Baa2. We have no other triggering events in our debt
    instruments that are tied to changes in specified credit ratings
    or stock price, nor have we entered into any transactions that
    would require us to issue equity, based on our credit rating or
    other triggering events.

We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of
    September 30, 2010. If we were unable to comply with our
    debt covenants, we would likely be required to repay our
    outstanding balances on demand, provide additional collateral or
    take other corrective actions.

Stock and

Share
    Repurchase Agreement

On, July 1, 2010, we entered into an accelerated share
    repurchase agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. under
    which we repurchased $100 million of our outstanding common
    stock in order to offset stock grants made under our various
    employee and director incentive compensation plans.

We paid $100 million to Goldman Sachs & Co. on
    July 7, 2010 in a share forward transaction and received
    2,958,580 shares of Atmos Energy common stock. We will
    receive the balance of the shares at the conclusion of the
    repurchase program. The specific number of shares we will
    ultimately repurchase in the transaction will be based generally
    on the average of the daily volume-weighted average share price
    of our common stock over the duration of the agreement. The
    agreement is scheduled to end in March 2011, although the
    termination date may be accelerated. As a result of this
    transaction, our weighted-average shares outstanding were
    reduced during the last three months of fiscal 2010. Beginning
    with our fourth fiscal quarter, the number of outstanding shares
    used to calculate our earnings per share was reduced by the
    number of shares repurchased as they were delivered to us and
    the $100 million purchase price was recorded as a reduction
    in shareholders’ equity. The repurchase transaction added
    $0.01 to fiscal 2010 earnings per share.

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

Total stock-based compensation expense was $12.7 million,
    $14.5 million and $14.0 million for the fiscal years
    ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, primarily related
    to restricted stock costs.


Long-Term

Incentive Plan

In August 1998, the Board of Directors approved and adopted the
    1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which became effective in
    October 1998 after approval by our shareholders. The LTIP is a
    comprehensive, long-term incentive compensation plan providing
    for discretionary awards of incentive stock options,
    non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, bonus
    stock, time-lapse restricted stock, time-lapse restricted stock
    units, performance-based restricted stock units and stock units
    to certain employees and non-employee directors of the Company
    and our subsidiaries. The objectives of this plan include
    attracting and retaining the best personnel, providing for
    additional performance incentives and promoting our success by
    providing employees with the opportunity to acquire common stock.

We are authorized to grant awards for up to a maximum of
    6.5 million shares of common stock under this plan subject
    to certain adjustment provisions. As of September 30, 2010,
    non-qualified stock options, bonus stock, time-lapse restricted
    stock, time-lapse restricted stock units, performance-based
    restricted stock units and stock units had been issued under
    this plan, and 848,730 shares were available for future
    issuance. The option price of the stock options issued under
    this plan is equal to the market price of our stock at the date
    of grant. These stock options expire 10 years from the date
    of the grant and vest annually over a service period ranging
    from one to three years. However, no stock options have been
    granted under this plan since fiscal 2003, except for a limited
    number of options that were converted from bonuses paid under
    our Annual Incentive Plan, the last of which occurred in fiscal
    2006.

Restricted
    Stock Plans

As noted above, the LTIP provides for discretionary awards of
    restricted stock units to help attract, retain and reward
    employees of Atmos Energy and its subsidiaries. Certain of these
    awards vest based upon the passage of time and other awards vest
    based upon the passage of time and the achievement of specified
    performance targets. The fair value of the awards granted is
    based on the market price of our stock at the date of grant. The
    associated expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period.

Employees who are granted shares of time-lapse restricted stock
    under our LTIP have a nonforfeitable right to dividends that are
    paid at the same rate at which they are paid on shares of stock
    without restrictions. In addition, employees who are granted
    shares of time-lapse restricted stock units under our LTIP have
    a nonforfeitable right to dividend equivalents that are paid at
    the same rate at which they are paid on shares of stock without
    restrictions. Both time-lapse restricted stock and time-lapse
    restricted stock units contain only a service condition that the
    employee recipients render continuous services to the Company
    for a period of three years from the date of grant, except for
    accelerated vesting in the event of death, disability, change of
    control of the Company or termination without cause (with
    certain exceptions). There are no performance conditions
    required to be met for employees to be vested in either the
    time-lapse restricted stock or time-lapse restricted stock units.

Employees who are granted shares of performance-based restricted
    stock units under our LTIP have a forfeitable right to dividends
    that accrue at the same rate at which they are paid on shares of
    stock without restrictions. Dividends on the performance-based
    restricted stock units are paid in the form of shares upon the
    vesting of the award. Performance-based restricted stock units
    contain a service condition that the employee recipients render
    continuous services to the Company for a period of three years
    from the date of grant, except for accelerated vesting in the
    event of death, disability, change of control of the Company or
    termination without cause (with certain exceptions) and a
    performance condition based on a cumulative earnings per share
    target amount.

Other
    Plans

Direct
    Stock Purchase Plan

We maintain a Direct Stock Purchase Plan, open to all investors,
    which allows participants to have all or part of their cash
    dividends paid quarterly in additional shares of our common
    stock. The minimum initial investment required to join the plan
    is $1,250. Direct Stock Purchase Plan participants may purchase
    additional shares of our common stock as often as weekly with
    voluntary cash payments of at least $25, up to an annual maximum
    of $100,000.

Outside
    Directors

Stock-For-Fee

Plan

In November 1994, the Board adopted the Outside Directors

Stock-for-Fee

Plan which was approved by our shareholders in February 1995 and
    was amended and restated in November 1997. The plan permits
    non-employee directors to receive all or part of their annual
    retainer and meeting fees in stock rather than in cash.

Equity
    Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
    Directors

In November 1998, the Board of Directors adopted the Equity
    Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
    Directors which was approved by our shareholders in February
    1999. This plan amended the Atmos Energy Corporation Deferred
    Compensation Plan for Outside Directors adopted by the Company
    in May 1990 and replaced the pension payable under our
    Retirement Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The plan provides
    non-employee directors of Atmos Energy with the opportunity to
    defer receipt, until retirement, of compensation for services
    rendered to the Company, invest deferred compensation into
    either a cash account or a stock account and to receive an
    annual grant of share units for each year of service on the
    Board.

Other
    Discretionary Compensation Plans

We adopted the Variable Pay Plan in fiscal 1999 for our
    regulated segments’ employees to give each employee an
    opportunity to share in our financial success based on the
    achievement of key performance measures considered critical to
    achieving business objectives for a given year and has minimum
    and maximum thresholds. The plan must meet the minimum threshold
    for the plan to be funded and distributed to employees. These
    performance measures may include earnings growth objectives,
    improved cash flow objectives or crucial customer satisfaction
    and safety results. We monitor progress towards the achievement
    of the performance measures throughout the year and record
    accruals based upon the expected payout using the best estimates
    available at the time the accrual is recorded. During the last
    several fiscal years, we have used earnings per share as our
    sole performance measure.

We adopted an incentive plan in October 2001 to give the
    employees in our nonregulated segments an opportunity to share
    in the success of the nonregulated operations. In fiscal 2010,
    we modified the award structure of the plan to reflect the
    different performance goals of the front and back office
    employees of our nonregulated operations. The front office award
    structure is based on a fixed percentage of the net income of
    our nonregulated operations that represents the available award
    pool for eligible employees. There is no minimum or maximum
    threshold for the available award pool. The back office award
    structure is based upon the net earnings of the nonregulated
    operations and has minimum and maximum thresholds. The plan must
    meet the minimum threshold in order for the plan to be funded
    and distributed to employees. We monitor the progress toward the
    achievement of the thresholds throughout the year and record
    accruals based upon the expected payout using the best estimates
    available at the time the accrual is recorded.

Retirement
    and Post-Retirement Employee Benefit Plans

We have both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit
    plans that together cover substantially all of our employees. We
    also maintain post-retirement plans that provide health care
    benefits to retired

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

employees. Finally, we sponsor defined contribution plans which
    cover substantially all employees. These plans are discussed in
    further detail below.

Effective September 30, 2007, we adopted the guidance
    issued by the FASB related to changes in the accounting rules
    for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The
    new standard made a significant change to the existing rules by
    requiring recognition in the balance sheet of the overfunded or
    underfunded positions of defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement plans, along with a corresponding noncash,
    after-tax adjustment to stockholders’ equity.

Additionally, this standard requires that our measurement date
    correspond to the fiscal year end balance sheet date. Effective
    October 1, 2008, the Company adopted the measurement date
    requirement using the remeasurement approach. Under this
    approach, the Company remeasured its projected benefit
    obligation, fair value of plan assets and its fiscal
    2009 net periodic cost. In accordance with the transition
    rules of the new standard, the impact of changing the
    measurement date decreased retained earnings by
    $7.8 million, net of tax, decreased the unrecognized
    actuarial loss by $9.0 million and increased our
    postretirement liabilities by $3.5 million as of
    October 1, 2008.

As a rate regulated entity, we generally recover our pension
    costs in our rates over a period of up to 15 years.
    Therefore, the decrease in the unrecognized actuarial loss that
    would have been recorded as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive loss, net of tax, was recorded as a reduction to a
    regulatory asset as a component of deferred charges and other
    assets in fiscal 2009. The change in the measurement date did
    not materially impact the level of net periodic pension cost we
    recorded in fiscal 2009.

The amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic
    pension cost that have been recorded as regulatory assets are as

    (collectively referred to as the Plans). The assets of the Plans
    are held within the Atmos Energy Corporation Master Retirement
    Trust (the Master Trust).



ATMOS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Plan is a cash balance pension plan that was established
    effective January 1999 and covers substantially all employees of
    Atmos Energy’s regulated operations. Opening account
    balances were established for participants as of January 1999
    equal to the present value of their respective accrued benefits
    under the pension plans which were previously in effect as of
    December 31, 1998. The Plan credits an allocation to each
    participant’s account at the end of each year according to
    a formula based on the participant’s age, service and total
    pay (excluding incentive pay).

The Plan also provides for an additional annual allocation based
    upon a participant’s age as of January 1, 1999 for
    those participants who were participants in the prior pension
    plans. The Plan credited this additional allocation each year
    through December 31, 2008. In addition, at the end of each
    year, a participant’s account will be credited with
    interest on the employee’s prior year account balance. A
    special grandfather benefit also applied through
    December 31, 2008, for participants who were at least
    age 50 as of January 1, 1999, and who were
    participants in one of the prior plans on December 31,
    1998. Participants are fully vested in their account balances
    after three years of service and may choose to receive their
    account balances as a lump sum or an annuity. In August 2010,
    the Board of Directors of Atmos Energy approved a proposal to
    close the Plan to new participants effective October 1,
    2010. Additionally, employees participating in the Plan as of
    October 1, 2010 will be allowed to make a one-time election
    to migrate from the Plan into our defined contribution plan
    which will be enhanced, effective January 1, 2011.

The Union Plan is a defined benefit plan that covers
    substantially all full-time union employees in our Mississippi
    Division. Under this plan, benefits are based upon years of
    benefit service and average final earnings. Participants vest in
    the plan after five years and will receive their benefit in an
    annuity.

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an
    amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, including the funding
    requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA).
    However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time
    to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to
    provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but
    also for those expected to be earned in the future.

During fiscal 2010 we did make any contributions to our pension
    plans. In fiscal 2009, we contributed $21.0 million in cash
    to the Plans to achieve a desired level of funding while
    maximizing the tax deductibility of this payment. In fiscal
    2008, we voluntarily contributed $2.3 million to the Union
    Plan, which achieved the desired level of funding for this plan
    for the 2007 plan year. Based upon market conditions subsequent
    to September 30, 2010, the current funded position of the
    plans and the new funding requirements under the PPA, we believe
    it is reasonably possible that we will be required to contribute
    to the Plans in fiscal 2011. Further, we will consider whether
    an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain
    certain PPA funding thresholds. However, we cannot anticipate
    with certainty whether such contributions will be made and the
    amount of such contributions.

We manage the Master Trust’s assets with the objective of
    achieving a rate of return net of inflation of approximately
    four percent per year. We make investment decisions and evaluate
    performance on a medium term horizon of at least three to five
    years. We also consider our current financial status when making
    recommendations and decisions regarding the Master Trust’s
    assets. Finally, we strive to ensure the Master Trust’s
    assets are appropriately invested to maintain an acceptable
    level of risk and meet the Master Trust’s long-term asset
    investment policy adopted by the Board of Directors.

To achieve these objectives, we invest the Master Trust’s
    assets in equity securities, fixed income securities, interests
    in commingled pension trust funds, other investment assets and
    cash and cash equivalents. Investments in equity securities are
    diversified among the market’s various subsectors in an
    effort to diversify risk and maximize returns. Fixed income
    securities are invested in investment grade securities. Cash
    equivalents are invested in securities that either are short
    term (less than 180 days) or readily convertible to cash
    with modest risk.

At September 30, 2010 and 2009, the Plan held
    1,169,700 shares of our common stock, which represented
    11.3 percent and 10.9 percent of total Master Trust
    assets. These shares generated dividend income for the Plan of
    approximately $1.6 million and $1.5 million during
    fiscal 2010 and 2009.

Our employee pension plan expenses and liabilities are
    determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous
    assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan
    assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets and
    assumed discount rates and demographic data. We review the
    estimates and assumptions underlying our employee pension plans
    annually based upon a September 30 measurement date. Prior to
    October 1, 2008, the estimates and assumptions were
    determined based on a June 30 measurement date. As described
    above, the adoption of new accounting guidance in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States necessitated a change in our measurement date during
    fiscal 2009. The development of our assumptions is fully
    described in our significant accounting policies in Note 2.
    The actuarial assumptions used to determine the pension
    liability for the Plans were determined as of September 30,
    2010 and 2009 and the actuarial assumptions used to determine
    the net periodic pension cost for the Plans were determined as

Supplemental
    Executive Benefits Plans

We have a nonqualified Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan
    which provides additional pension, disability and death benefits
    to our officers, division presidents and certain other employees
    of the Company who were employed on or before August 12,
    1998. In addition, in August 1998, we adopted the Supplemental
    Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) (formerly known as the
    Performance-Based Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan), which
    covers all employees who become officers or division presidents
    after August 12, 1998 or any other employees selected by
    our Board of Directors at its discretion.

In August 2009, the Board of Directors determined that there
    would be no new participants in the SERP subsequent to
    August 5, 2009, except for any corporate officers who may
    be appointed to the Management Committee. The SERP is a
    60 percent of covered compensation defined benefit
    arrangement in which benefits from the underlying qualified
    defined benefit plan are an offset to the benefits under the
    SERP. However, the Board also established a new defined benefit
    supplemental executive retirement plan (the 2009 SERP),
    effective August 5, 2009, with each participant being
    selected by the Board, with each such participant being either
    (i) a corporate officer (other than such officer who is
    appointed as a member of the Company’s Management
    Committee), (ii) a division president or (iii) an
    employee selected in the discretion of the Board. Under the 2009
    SERP, a nominal account has been established for each
    participant, to which the Company contributes at the end of each
    calendar year an amount equal to ten percent of the total of
    each participant’s base salary and cash incentive
    compensation earned during each prior calendar year, beginning
    December 31, 2009. The benefits vest after three years of
    vesting and attainment of age 55 and earn interest credits
    at the same annual rate as the Company’s Pension Account
    Plan (currently 4.69%).

Similar to our employee pension plans, we review the estimates
    and assumptions underlying our supplemental executive benefit
    plans annually based upon a September 30 measurement date using
    the same

Postretirement
    Benefits

We sponsor the Retiree Medical Plan for Retirees and Disabled
    Employees of Atmos Energy Corporation (the Atmos Retiree Medical
    Plan). This plan provides medical and prescription drug
    protection to all qualified participants based on their date of
    retirement. The Atmos Retiree Medical Plan provides different
    levels of benefits depending on the level of coverage chosen by
    the participants and the terms of predecessor plans; however, we
    generally pay 80 percent of the projected net claims and
    administrative costs and participants pay the remaining
    20 percent of this cost.

As of September 30, 2009, the Board of Directors approved a
    change to the cost sharing methodology for employees who had not
    met the participation requirements by that date for the Atmos
    Retiree Medical Plan. Starting on January 1, 2015, the
    contribution rates that will apply to all non-grandfathered
    participants will be determined using a new cost sharing
    methodology by which Atmos Energy will limit its contribution to
    a three percent cost increase in claims and administrative costs
    each year. If medical costs covered by the Atmos Retiree Medical
    Plan increase more than three percent annually, participants
    will be responsible for the additional cost.

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an
    amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. However, additional
    voluntary contributions are made annually as considered
    necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for
    benefits attributed to service to date but also for those
    expected to be earned in the future. We expect to contribute
    $13.0 million to our postretirement benefits plan during
    fiscal 2011.

We maintain a formal investment policy with respect to the

    funding the postretirement benefit plan are appropriately
    invested to maintain an acceptable level of risk. We also

    recommendations and decisions regarding the postretirement
    benefits plan.

We currently invest the assets funding our postretirement

Defined
    Contribution Plans

As of September 30, 2010, we maintained three defined
    contribution benefit plans: the Atmos Energy Corporation
    Retirement Savings Plan and Trust (the Retirement Savings Plan),
    the Atmos Energy Corporation Savings Plan for MVG Union
    Employees (the Union 401K Plan) and the Atmos Energy Marketing,
    LLC 401K Profit-Sharing Plan (the AEM 401K Profit-Sharing Plan).

The Retirement Savings Plan covers substantially all employees
    in our regulated operations and is subject to the provisions of
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Effective
    January 1, 2007, employees automatically became
    participants of the Retirement Savings Plan on the date of
    employment. Participants may elect a salary reduction ranging
    from a minimum of one percent up to a maximum of 65 percent
    of eligible compensation, as defined by the Plan, not to exceed
    the maximum allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. New
    participants are automatically enrolled in the Plan at a salary
    reduction amount of four percent of eligible compensation, from
    which they may opt out. We match 100 percent of a
    participant’s contributions, limited to four percent of the
    participant’s salary, in our common stock. However,
    participants have the option to immediately transfer this
    matching contribution into other funds held within the plan.
    Participants are eligible to receive matching contributions
    after completing one year of service. Participants are also
    permitted to take out loans against their accounts subject to
    certain restrictions. In August 2010, the Board of Directors of
    Atmos Energy approved a proposal to close the Pension Account
    Plan to new participants effective October 1, 2010. New
    employees will participate in our defined contribution plan,
    which has been enhanced, effective January 1, 2011. Current
    employees participating in the Pension Account Plan as of
    October 1, 2010 will be allowed to make a one-time election
    to migrate from the Plan into our defined contribution plan,
    effective January 1, 2011. Under the enhanced plan,
    participants will receive a fixed annual contribution of four
    percent of eligible earnings to their Retirement Savings Plan
    account. Participants will continue to be eligible for company
    matching contributions of up to four percent of their eligible
    earnings and will be fully vested in the fixed annual
    contribution after three years of service.

The Union 401K Plan covers substantially all Mississippi
    Division employees who are members of the International Chemical
    Workers Union Council, United Food and Commercial Workers Union
    International (the Union) and is subject to the provisions of
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees of
    the Union automatically become participants of the Union 401K
    plan on the date of union membership. We match 50 percent
    of a participant’s contribution in cash, limited to six
    percent of the participant’s eligible contribution.
    Participants are also permitted to take out loans against their
    accounts subject to certain restrictions.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Matching contributions to the Retirement Savings Plan and the
    Union 401K Plan are expensed as incurred and amounted to
    $9.8 million, $9.3 million, and $8.9 million for
    fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008. The Board of Directors may
    also approve discretionary contributions, subject to the
    provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and applicable
    regulations of the Internal Revenue Service. No discretionary
    contributions were made for fiscal years 2010, 2009 or 2008. At
    September 30, 2010 and 2009, the Retirement Savings Plan
    held 4.3 percent and 3.8 percent of our outstanding
    common stock.

The AEM 401K Profit-Sharing Plan covers substantially all AEM
    employees and is subject to the provisions of
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participants
    may elect a salary reduction ranging from a minimum of one
    percent up to a maximum of 65 percent of eligible
    compensation, as defined by the Plan, not to exceed the maximum
    allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company may elect
    to make safe harbor contributions up to three percent of the
    employee’s salary which vest immediately. The Company may
    also make discretionary profit sharing contributions to the AEM
    401K Profit-Sharing Plan. Participants become fully vested in
    the discretionary profit-sharing contributions after three years
    of service. Participants are also permitted to take out loans
    against their accounts subject to certain restrictions.
    Discretionary contributions to the AEM 401K Profit-Sharing Plan
    are expensed as incurred and amounted to $1.3 million,
    $1.2 million and $1.2 million for fiscal years 2010,
    2009 and 2008.

In February 2008, Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC, a subsidiary
    of AEH, announced plans to construct and operate a salt-cavern
    storage project in Franklin Parish, Louisiana. During the fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2009, management approved a plan
    to pursue the sale of the storage facility project which was
    expected to be completed within fiscal 2010; therefore the
    assets were classified in other current assets as an asset held
    for sale as of September 30, 2009. In March 2010, we
    entered into an option and acquisition agreement with a third
    party, which provides the third party with the exclusive option
    to develop the proposed Fort Necessity salt-dome natural
    gas storage project. If the option is exercised, we will retain
    a non-controlling equity position in Fort Necessity and
    will share in a percentage of the profits. In July 2010, we
    signed an extension to the option and acquisition agreement
    which gives the third party until March 2011 to exercise the
    option to develop the project. Due to the current status of the
    project, the assets are presented as a long-term asset as of
    September 30, 2010 and are no longer classified as an asset
    held for sale.

Earnings
    Per Share

As discussed in Note 2, since we have non-vested
    share-based payments with a nonforfeitable right to dividends or
    dividend equivalents (referred to as participating securities)
    we are required to use the two-class method of computing
    earnings per share as of October 1, 2009. The
    Company’s non-vested restricted stock and restricted stock
    units, granted under the LTIP, for which vesting is predicated
    solely on the passage of time, are considered to be
    participating securities. The calculation of earnings per share
    using the two-class method excludes income attributable to these
    participating securities from the numerator and excludes the
    dilutive impact of those shares from the denominator. The
    presentation of earnings per share for previously reported
    periods has been adjusted to reflect the retrospective adoption
    of this standard.

    do not expire. The federal net operating loss carryforwards are
    available to offset taxable income and will begin to expire in
    2028. Depending on the jurisdiction in which the state net
    operating loss was generated, the state net operating loss
    carryforwards will begin to expire between 2015 and 2028.

As of September 30, 2010 and 2009, we had recorded
    liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions totaling
    $6.7 million. The realization of all of these tax benefits
    would reduce our income tax expense by approximately
    $6.7 million. There were no changes in unrecognized tax
    benefits as a result of tax positions taken during the current
    or prior years or as a result of settlements with taxing
    authorities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010.

We recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax
    benefits as a component of interest expense. We recognize
    penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of
    miscellaneous income (expense) in accordance with regulatory
    requirements. We recognized a tax expense of $0.5 million
    and $0.1 million related to penalty and interest expenses
    during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010 and 2009
    and a tax benefit of $1.2 million during the fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2008.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction
    as well as in various states where we have operations. We have
    concluded substantially all U.S. federal income tax matters
    through fiscal year 2004.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Litigation

Colorado-Kansas
    Division

Atmos Energy was a defendant in a lawsuit originally filed by
    Quinque Operating Company, Tom Boles and Robert Ditto in
    September 1999 in the District Court of Stevens County, Kansas
    against more than 200 companies in the natural gas
    industry. The plaintiffs, who purported to represent a class of
    royalty owners, alleged that the defendants had underpaid
    royalties on gas taken from wells situated on non-federal and
    non-Indian lands in Kansas, predicated upon allegations that the
    defendants’ gas measurements were inaccurate. The
    plaintiffs did not specifically allege an amount of damages. We
    were also a defendant, along with over 50 other companies in the
    natural gas industry, in another proposed class action lawsuit
    filed in the same court by Will Price, Tom Boles and The Cooper
    Clarke Foundation in May 2003 involving similar allegations. In
    September 2009, the court ruled that the plaintiffs in both
    cases had not provided sufficient evidence to meet the standards
    of a class action and denied class action status to each of the
    plaintiffs in both cases. In September 2010, Atmos Energy was
    dismissed from these cases without liability by the District
    Court of Stevens County, Kansas.

We are a party to other litigation and claims that have arisen
    in the ordinary course of our business. While the results of
    such litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty,
    we believe the final outcome of such litigation and claims will
    not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flows.

Environmental
    Matters

Former
    Manufactured Gas Plant Sites

We are the owner or previous owner of former manufactured gas
    plant sites in Johnson City and Bristol, Tennessee, Keokuk,
    Iowa, Hannibal, Missouri and Owensboro, Kentucky, which were
    used to supply gas prior to the availability of natural gas. The
    gas manufacturing process resulted in certain byproducts and
    residual materials, including coal tar. The manufacturing
    process used by our predecessors was an acceptable and
    satisfactory process at the time such operations were being
    conducted. Under current environmental protection laws and
    regulations, we may be responsible for response actions with
    respect to such materials if response

actions are necessary. We have taken removal actions with
    respect to the sites that have been approved by the applicable
    regulatory authorities in Tennessee, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky
    and the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

We are a party to other environmental matters and claims that
    have arisen in the ordinary course of our business. While the
    ultimate results of response actions to these environmental
    matters and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we
    believe the final outcome of such response actions will not have
    a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations or cash flows because we believe that the
    expenditures related to such response actions will either be
    recovered through rates, shared with other parties or are
    adequately covered by insurance.

Purchase
    Commitments

AEM has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural
    gas under contracts indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed
    price contracts. At September 30, 2010, AEM was committed
    to purchase 69.5 Bcf within one year, 28.4 Bcf within
    one to three years and 3.2 Bcf after three years under
    indexed contracts. AEM is committed to purchase 3.1 Bcf
    within one year and 0.3 Bcf within one to three years under
    fixed price contracts with prices ranging from $3.55 to $6.36
    per Mcf. Purchases under these contracts totaled
    $1,562.8 million, $1,484.5 million and
    $3,075.0 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Our natural gas distribution divisions, except for our Mid-Tex
    Division, maintain supply contracts with several vendors that
    generally cover a period of up to one year. Commitments for
    estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts
    on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices.
    Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as
    necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the
    individual contract.

Our Mid-Tex Division maintains long-term supply contracts to
    ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service
    area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market
    and fixed prices. The estimated commitments under these
    contracts as of September 30, 2010 are as follows (in

Other
    Contingencies

In December 2007, the Company received data requests from the
    Division of Investigations of the Office of Enforcement of the
    Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the
    “Commission”) in connection with its investigation
    into possible violations of the Commission’s posting and
    competitive bidding regulations for pre-arranged released firm
    capacity on natural gas pipelines. We have responded timely to
    data requests received from the Commission and are fully
    cooperating with the Commission during this investigation.

The Commission agreed to allow the Company to conduct our own
    internal investigation into compliance with the
    Commission’s rules. We have completed the investigation and
    have provided a report on the results of the investigation to
    the Commission, which report is currently under review by the
    Commission. We currently are unable to predict the final outcome
    of this investigation or the potential impact it could have on
    our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

We have been replacing certain steel service lines in our
    Mid-Tex Division since our acquisition of the natural gas
    distribution system in 2004. Since early 2010, we have been
    discussing the financial and operational details of an
    accelerated steel service line replacement program with
    representatives of 440 municipalities served by our Mid-Tex
    Division. Two coalitions of cities, representing the majority of
    the cities our Mid-Tex Division serves, have agreed to a program
    of installing 100,000 replacements during the next two years,
    with approved recovery of the associated return, depreciation
    and taxes. Under the terms of the agreement, the accelerated
    replacement program will commence in fiscal 2011 at a total
    projected capital cost of $80 — $120 million,
    with completion expected in September 2012.

    terms range from one to 21 years and generally provide for
    the payment of taxes, insurance and maintenance by the lessee.
    Renewal options exist for certain of these leases. We have also
    entered into capital leases for division offices and operating
    facilities. Property, plant and equipment included amounts for
    capital leases of $1.3 million at September 30, 2010
    and 2009. Accumulated depreciation for these capital leases
    totaled $0.8 million at September 30, 2010 and 2009.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to us if a customer
    fails to perform its contractual obligations. We engage in
    transactions for the purchase and sale of products and services
    with major companies in the energy industry and with industrial,
    commercial, residential and municipal energy consumers. These
    transactions principally occur in the southern and midwestern
    regions of the United States. We believe that this geographic
    concentration does not contribute significantly to our overall
    exposure to credit risk. Credit risk associated with trade
    accounts receivable for the natural gas distribution segment is
    mitigated by the large number of individual customers and
    diversity in our customer base. The credit risk for our other
    segments is not significant.

Customer diversification also helps mitigate AEM’s exposure
    to credit risk. AEM maintains credit policies with respect to
    its counterparties that it believes minimizes overall credit
    risk. Where appropriate, such policies include the evaluation of
    a prospective counterparty’s financial condition,
    collateral requirements, primarily consisting of letters of
    credit, and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate
    the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty.
    AEM also monitors the financial condition of existing
    counterparties on an ongoing basis. Customers not meeting
    minimum standards are required to provide adequate assurance of
    financial performance.

AEM maintains a provision for credit losses based upon factors
    surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends,
    consideration of the current credit environment and other
    information. We believe, based on our credit policies and our
    provisions for credit losses as of September 30, 2010, that
    our financial position,



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

results of operations and cash flows will not be materially
    affected as a result of nonperformance by any single
    counterparty.

AEM’s estimated credit exposure is monitored in terms of
    the percentage of its customers, including affiliate customers
    that are rated as investment grade versus non-investment grade.
    Credit exposure is defined as the total of (1) accounts
    receivable, (2) delivered, but unbilled physical sales and

(3) mark-to-market

exposure for sales and purchases. Investment grade
    determinations are set internally by AEM’s credit
    department, but are primarily based on external ratings provided
    by Moody’s Investors Service Inc. (Moody’s)

and/or

Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P). For
    non-rated entities, the default rating for municipalities is
    investment grade, while the default rating for non-guaranteed
    industrials and commercials is non-investment grade. The
    following table shows the percentages related to the investment

    grade counterparties are composed of counterparties that are
    below investment grade or that have not been assigned an
    internal investment grade rating due to the short-term nature of
    the contracts associated with that counterparty. This category
    is composed of numerous smaller counterparties, none of which is
    individually significant.

Segment
    Information

Atmos Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries are engaged
    primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution,
    transmission and storage business as well as other nonregulated
    businesses. We distribute natural gas through sales and
    transportation arrangements to over three million residential,
    commercial, public authority and industrial customers through
    our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions, which
    cover service areas located in 12 states. In addition, we
    transport natural gas for others through our distribution system.

Through our nonregulated businesses, we primarily provide
    natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities,
    other local distribution companies and industrial customers
    primarily in the Midwest and Southeast. Additionally, we provide
    natural gas transportation and storage services to certain of
    our natural gas distribution operations and to third parties.

We operate the Company through the following four segments:

•

The

natural gas distribution segment

, which includes our
    regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations.

•

The

regulated transmission and storage segment

, which
    includes the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the
    Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division.

•

The

natural gas marketing segment

, which includes a
    variety of nonregulated natural gas management services.

•

The

pipeline, storage and other segment

, which includes
    our nonregulated natural gas transmission and storage services.

Our determination of reportable segments considers the strategic
    operating units under which we manage sales of various products
    and services to customers in differing regulatory environments.
    Although our natural gas distribution segment operations are
    geographically dispersed, they are reported as a single segment
    as each natural gas distribution division has similar economic
    characteristics. The accounting policies of the segments are the
    same as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies. We evaluate performance based on net income or loss of
    the respective operating units. Interest expense is allocated
    pro rata to each segment based upon our net investment in each
    segment. Income taxes are allocated to each segment as if each
    segment’s taxes were calculated on a separate return basis.

Selected
    Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

Summarized unaudited quarterly financial data is presented
    below. The sum of net income per share by quarter may not equal
    the net income per share for the fiscal year due to variations
    in the weighted average shares outstanding used in computing
    such amounts. Our businesses are seasonal due to weather

Management’s
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer, of the
    effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures, as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange
    Act). Based on this evaluation, the Company’s principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded
    that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective as of September 30, 2010 to provide reasonable
    assurance that information required to be disclosed by us,
    including our consolidated entities, in the reports that we file
    or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by
    the SEC’s rules and forms, including a reasonable level of
    assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated
    to our management, including our principal executive and
    principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f),

in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting based on the framework in

Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework

issued by COSO and applicable
    Securities and Exchange Commission rules, our management
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of September 30, 2010, in providing reasonable
    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
    the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Ernst & Young LLP has issued its report on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Atmos Energy Corporation

We have audited Atmos Energy Corporation’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of September 30, 2010, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Atmos Energy
    Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Atmos Energy Corporation maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of September 30, 2010, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2010 and
    2009, and the related statements of income, stockholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended September 30, 2010 of Atmos Energy Corporation and
    our report dated November 12, 2010 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.
