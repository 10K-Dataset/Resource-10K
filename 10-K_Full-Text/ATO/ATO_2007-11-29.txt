PART I

The terms “we,” “our,” “us,”
    “Atmos” and “Atmos Energy” refer to Atmos
    Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context
    suggests otherwise.

ITEM 1.

Business

Overview

Atmos Energy Corporation, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is
    engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and
    transmission and storage businesses as well as other
    nonregulated natural gas businesses. We are one of the
    country’s largest natural-gas-only distributors based on
    number of customers and one of the largest intrastate pipeline
    operators in Texas based upon miles of pipe. As of
    September 30, 2007, we distributed natural gas through
    sales and transportation arrangements to approximately
    3.2 million residential, commercial, public authority and
    industrial customers through our six regulated natural gas
    distribution divisions, which covered service areas in
    12 states. Our primary service areas are located in
    Colorado, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee
    and Texas. We have more limited service areas in Georgia,
    Illinois, Iowa, Missouri and Virginia. In addition, we transport
    natural gas for others through our distribution system.

Through our nonregulated businesses, we primarily provide
    natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities,
    other local gas distribution companies and industrial customers
    in 22 states and natural gas transportation and storage
    services to certain of our natural gas distribution divisions
    and to third parties.

We were organized under the laws of Texas in 1983 as Energas
    Company for the purpose of owning and operating the natural gas
    distribution business of Pioneer Corporation in Texas. In
    September 1988, we changed our name to Atmos Energy Corporation.
    As a result of the merger with United Cities Gas Company in July
    1997, we also became incorporated in Virginia.

Operating
    Segments

Through August 31, 2007, our operations were divided into
    four segments:

•

the

utility segment

, which included our regulated natural
    gas distribution and related sales operations,

•

the

natural gas marketing segment

, which included a
    variety of nonregulated natural gas management services,

•

the

pipeline and storage segment

, which included our
    regulated and nonregulated natural gas transmission and storage
    services and

•

the

other nonutility segment

, which included all of our
    other nonregulated nonutility operations.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we completed a series
    of organizational changes and began reporting the results of our
    operations under the following new segments, effective
    September 1, 2007:

•

The

natural gas distribution segment

, formerly referred
    to as the utility segment, includes our regulated natural gas
    distribution and related sales operations.

•

The

regulated transmission and storage segment

includes
    the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division. These operations were
    previously included in the former pipeline and storage segment.

•

The

natural gas marketing segment

remains unchanged and
    includes a variety of nonregulated natural gas management
    services.

•

The

pipeline, storage and other segment

primarily is
    comprised of our nonregulated natural gas transmission and
    storage services, which were previously included in the former
    pipeline and storage segment.



Strategy

Our overall strategy is to:

•

deliver superior shareholder value,

•

improve the quality and consistency of earnings growth, while
    operating our regulated and nonregulated businesses
    exceptionally well and

•

enhance and strengthen a culture built on our core values.

Over the last five fiscal years, we have primarily grown through
    two significant acquisitions, our acquisition in December 2002
    of Mississippi Valley Gas Company (MVG) and our acquisition in
    October 2004 of the natural gas distribution and pipeline
    operations of TXU Gas Company (TXU Gas).

We have experienced over 20 consecutive years of increasing
    dividends and earnings growth after giving effect to our
    acquisitions. We have achieved this record of growth while
    efficiently managing our operating and maintenance expenses and
    leveraging our technology, such as our

24-hour

call
    centers, to achieve more efficient operations. In addition, we
    have focused on regulatory rate proceedings to increase revenue
    to recover rising costs and mitigated weather-related risks
    through weather-normalized rates in most of our service areas.
    We have also strengthened our nonregulated businesses by
    increasing gross profit margins, expanding commercial
    opportunities in our regulated transmission and storage segment
    and actively pursuing opportunities to increase the amount of
    storage available to us.

Our core values include focusing on our employees and customers
    while conducting our business with honesty and integrity. We
    continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing
    communications with our employees and enhanced employee training.

Natural
    Gas Distribution Segment Overview

Our natural gas distribution segment consisted of the following
    six regulated divisions during the year ended September 30,
    2007:

•

Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division,

•

Atmos Energy Kentucky/Mid-States Division,

•

Atmos Energy Louisiana Division,

•

Atmos Energy West Texas Division,

•

Atmos Energy Mississippi Division and

•

Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division

Our natural gas distribution business is a seasonal business.
    Gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater
    during the winter months than during the remainder of the year.
    The volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with
    the temperatures during these months.

In addition to seasonality, financial results for this segment
    are affected by the cost of natural gas and economic conditions
    in the areas that we serve. Higher gas costs, which we are
    generally able to pass through to our customers under purchased
    gas adjustment clauses, may cause customers to conserve or, in
    the case of industrial customers, to use alternative energy
    sources. Higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts
    receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense and
    may require us to increase borrowings under our credit
    facilities resulting in higher interest expense.

The effect of weather that is above or below normal is
    substantially offset through weather normalization adjustments,
    known as WNA, which are now approved by the regulatory
    authorities for over 90 percent of residential and
    commercial meters in our service areas. WNA allows us to
    increase customers’ bills to offset lower gas usage when
    weather is warmer than normal and decrease customers’ bills
    to offset higher gas usage when weather is colder than normal.



As of September 30, 2007 we had WNA for our residential and
    commercial meters in the following service areas for the
    following periods:

Georgia

October — May

Kansas

October — May

Kentucky

November — April

Louisiana

December — March

Mississippi

Tennessee

Texas: Mid-Tex

January — December

Our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers,
    including independent producers, marketers and pipeline
    companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted
    storage assets. Additionally, the natural gas supply for our
    Mid-Tex Division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements.

Supply arrangements are contracted from our suppliers on a firm
    basis with various terms at market prices. The firm supply
    consists of both base load and swing supply (peaking)
    quantities. Base load quantities are those that flow at a
    constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities
    provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match
    increases or decreases in requirements related to weather
    conditions.

Currently, all of our natural gas distribution divisions, except
    for our Mid-Tex Division, utilize 37 pipeline transportation
    companies, both interstate and intrastate, to transport our
    natural gas. The pipeline transportation agreements are firm and
    many of them have “pipeline no-notice” storage service
    which provides for daily balancing between system requirements
    and nominated flowing supplies. These agreements have been
    negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still
    maintaining our right of first refusal. The natural gas supply
    for our Mid-Tex Division is delivered by our Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division.

Except for local production purchases, we select our natural gas
    suppliers through a competitive bidding process by requesting
    proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can
    provide reliable service. We select these suppliers based on
    their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm
    pipeline receipt points at the lowest cost. Major suppliers
    during fiscal 2007 were Anadarko Energy Services, BP Energy
    Company, Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc., ConocoPhillips
    Company, Devon Gas Services, L.P., Enbridge Marketing (US) L.P.,
    National Fuel Marketing Company, LLC, ONEOK Energy Services
    Company L.P., Tenaska Marketing and Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC,
    our natural gas marketing subsidiary.

The combination of base load, peaking and spot purchase
    agreements, coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage,
    allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather, which
    minimizes our need to enter into long-term firm commitments. We
    estimate our

peak-day

availability of natural gas supply to be approximately
    4.2 Bcf. The

peak-day

demand for our natural gas distribution operations in fiscal
    2007 was on February 15, 2007, when sales to customers
    reached approximately 3.4 Bcf.

To maintain our deliveries to high priority customers, we have
    the ability, and have exercised our right, to curtail deliveries
    to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts
    or applicable state statutes or regulations. Our customers’
    demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our
    ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or
    immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the
    physical limitations of gathering, storage and transmission
    systems, the duration and severity of cold weather, the
    availability of gas reserves from our suppliers, the ability to
    purchase additional supplies on a short-term basis and actions
    by federal and state regulatory authorities. Curtailment rights
    provide us the flexibility to meet the human-needs requirements
    of our customers on a firm basis. Priority allocations imposed
    by federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as other
    factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to meet the
    demands of our customers. We anticipate no problems with
    obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers.

The following briefly describes our six natural gas distribution
    divisions. We operate in our service areas under terms of
    non-exclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities
    and towns that we serve. At



September 30, 2007, we held 1,106 franchises having terms
    generally ranging from five to 35 years. A significant
    number of our franchises expire each year, which require renewal
    prior to the end of their terms. We believe that we will be able
    to renew our franchises as they expire. Additional information
    concerning our natural gas distribution divisions is presented
    under the caption “Operating Statistics”.

Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division.

Our Mid-Tex
    Division serves approximately 550 communities in the
    north-central, eastern and western parts of Texas, including the
    Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. This division currently
    operates under one system-wide rate structure. However, the
    governing body of each municipality we serve has original
    jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates, operations and
    services within its city limits, except with respect to sales of
    natural gas for vehicle fuel and agricultural use. The Railroad
    Commission of Texas (RRC) has exclusive appellate jurisdiction
    over all rate and regulatory orders and ordinances of the
    municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates
    and services to customers not located within the limits of a
    municipality. This division participates in Texas’ Gas
    Reliability Infrastructure Program (GRIP), which allows us to
    include in rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in
    the prior calendar year. The program also requires us to file a
    complete rate case at least once every five years.

Atmos Energy Kentucky/Mid-States Division.

Our
    Kentucky/Mid-States Division operates in more than 420
    communities across Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri,
    Tennessee and Virginia. The service areas in these states are
    primarily rural; however, this division serves Franklin,
    Tennessee, which is less than 20 miles from downtown
    Nashville. We update our rates in this division through periodic
    formal rate filings made with each state’s public service
    commission.

Atmos Energy Louisiana Division.

In Louisiana,
    we serve nearly 300 communities, including the suburban areas of
    New Orleans, the metropolitan area of Monroe and western
    Louisiana. Direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers
    in Louisiana, who use gas for fuel or in manufacturing
    processes, and sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel are exempt
    from regulation and are recognized in our natural gas marketing
    segment. Our rates in this division are updated annually through
    a stable rate filing without filing a formal rate case.

Atmos Energy West Texas Division.

Our West
    Texas Division serves approximately 80 communities in West
    Texas, including the Amarillo, Lubbock and Midland areas. Like
    our Mid-Tex Division, each municipality we serve has original
    jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates, operations and
    services within its city limits. Similarly, the West Texas
    Division also participates in GRIP, which requires us to file a
    complete rate case at least once every five years.

Atmos Energy Mississippi Division.

In
    Mississippi, we serve about 110 communities throughout the
    northern half of the state, including the Jackson metropolitan
    area. Our rates in the Mississippi Division are updated annually
    through a stable rate filing without filing a formal rate case.

Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division.

Our
    Colorado-Kansas Division serves approximately
    170 communities throughout Colorado and Kansas and in the
    southwestern corner of Missouri, including Olathe, Kansas, and
    Greeley, Colorado. Olathe is a southern suburb of Kansas City,
    near the Missouri border. Greeley is located 20 miles
    outside of Denver. We update our rates in this division through
    periodic formal rate filings made with each state’s public
    service commission.

Regulated
    Transmission and Storage Segment Overview

Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the
    regulated pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division. The Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division transports natural gas to
    our Mid-Tex Division, transports natural gas for third parties
    and manages five underground storage reservoirs in Texas. We
    also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline
    industry including parking arrangements, lending and sales of
    inventory on hand. Parking arrangements provide short-term
    interruptible storage of gas on our pipeline. Lending services
    provide short-term interruptible loans of natural gas from our
    pipeline to meet market demands. These operations represent one
    of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in Texas with a
    heavy concentration in the established natural gas-producing
    areas of central, northern and eastern Texas, extending into or
    near the major producing areas of the Texas Gulf Coast and the
    Delaware and Val Verde Basins of West Texas. Nine basins located
    in Texas are believed to contain a substantial portion of the
    nation’s remaining onshore natural gas reserves. This
    pipeline system provides access to all of these basins.

Natural
    Gas Marketing Segment Overview

Our natural gas marketing activities are conducted through Atmos
    Energy Marketing (AEM), which is wholly-owned by Atmos Energy
    Holdings, Inc. (AEH), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEC, which
    operates in 22 states. AEM provides a variety of natural
    gas management services to municipalities, natural gas utility
    systems and industrial natural gas consumers primarily in the
    southeastern and midwestern states and to our Colorado-Kansas,
    Kentucky/Mid-States and Louisiana divisions. These services
    primarily consist of furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed
    and market-based prices, contract negotiation and
    administration, load forecasting, gas storage acquisition and
    management services, transportation services, peaking sales and
    balancing services, capacity utilization strategies and gas
    price hedging through the use of derivative instruments. We use
    proprietary and customer-owned transportation and storage assets
    to provide the various services our customers request. As a
    result, our revenues arise from the types of commercial
    transactions we have structured with our customers and include
    the value we extract by optimizing the storage and
    transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues
    for services we deliver.

To optimize the storage and transportation capacity we own or
    control, we participate in transactions in which we combine the
    natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our
    costs incurred to serve our customers by identifying the lowest
    cost alternative within the natural gas supplies, transportation
    and markets to which we have access. Additionally, we engage in
    natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and
    profit from the pricing differences that occur over time. We
    purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial contracts
    at favorable prices to lock in a gross profit margin. Through
    the use of transportation and storage services and derivative
    contracts, we are able to capture gross profit margin through



the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by
    recognizing pricing differences that occur over time.

AEM’s management of natural gas requirements involves the
    sale of natural gas and the management of storage and
    transportation supplies under contracts with customers generally
    having one to two year terms. AEM also sells natural gas to some
    of its industrial customers on a delivered burner tip basis
    under contract terms from 30 days to two years.

Pipeline,
    Storage and Other Segment Overview

Our pipeline, storage and other segment primarily consists of
    the operations of Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC (APS), Atmos
    Energy Services, LLC (AES) and Atmos Power Systems, Inc., which
    are each wholly-owned by AEH.

APS owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in
    Kentucky and Louisiana. We use these storage facilities to
    reduce the need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to
    meet customer demand during peak periods. Additionally,
    beginning in fiscal 2006, APS initiated activities in the
    natural gas gathering business. As of September 30, 2007,
    these activities were limited in nature.

AES, through December 31, 2006, provided natural gas
    management services to our natural gas distribution operations,
    other than the Mid-Tex Division. These services included
    aggregating and purchasing gas supply, arranging transportation
    and storage logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our
    natural gas distribution service areas at competitive prices.
    Effective January 1, 2007, our shared services function
    began providing these services to our natural gas distribution
    operations. AES continues to provide limited services to our
    natural gas distribution divisions, and the revenues AES
    receives are equal to the costs incurred to provide those
    services.

Through Atmos Power Systems, Inc., we have constructed electric
    peaking power-generating plants and associated facilities and
    lease these plants through lease agreements that are accounted
    for as sales under generally accepted accounting principles.

Through January 2004, United Cities Propane Gas, Inc., a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Atmos Energy Holdings, Inc., owned an
    approximate 19 percent membership interest in
    U.S. Propane L.P. (USP), a joint venture formed in February
    2000 with other utility companies to own a limited partnership
    interest in Heritage Propane Partners, L.P. (Heritage), a
    publicly-traded marketer of propane through a nationwide retail
    distribution network. During fiscal 2004, we sold our interest
    in USP and Heritage. As a result of these transactions, we no
    longer have an interest in the propane business.

Ratemaking
    Activity

Overview

The method of determining regulated rates varies among the
    states in which our natural gas distribution divisions operate.
    The regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring
    that utilities under their jurisdictions operate in the best
    interests of customers while providing utility companies the
    opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment.
    Generally, each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and
    establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue
    sufficient to cover the costs of doing business and to provide a
    reasonable return on invested capital.

Rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost
    adjustment mechanisms that (i) are subject to significant
    price fluctuations compared to the utility’s other costs,
    (ii) represent a large component of the utility’s cost
    of service and (iii) are generally outside the control of
    the utility.

Purchased gas mechanisms represent a common form of cost
    adjustment mechanism. Purchased gas adjustment mechanisms
    provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased
    gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because
    they provide a dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or
    decreases in natural gas distribution gas costs. Therefore,
    although substantially all of our natural gas distribution
    operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we
    purchase, natural gas distribution gross profit (which is
    defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost) is
    generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas.

Additionally, some jurisdictions have introduced
    performance-based ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives
    to natural gas utilities to minimize purchased gas costs through
    improved storage management and use of financial hedges to lock
    in gas costs. Under the performance-based ratemaking adjustment,
    purchased gas costs savings are shared between the utility
    company and its customers.

Current
    Ratemaking Strategy

Our current rate strategy focuses on seeking rate designs that
    reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of
    our approved margins from customer usage patterns due to
    weather-related variability, declining use per customer and
    energy conservation, also known as decoupling. Additionally, we
    are seeking to stratify rates to benefit low income households
    and to recover the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense.

Improving rate design is a long-term process. In the interim, we
    are addressing regulatory lag issues by directing discretionary
    capital spending to jurisdictions that permit us to recover our
    investment timely and file rate cases on a more frequent basis
    to minimize the regulatory lag to keep our actual returns more
    closely aligned with our allowed returns.



Recent
    Ratemaking Activity

Approximately 97 percent of our natural gas distribution
    revenues in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007, 2006
    and 2005 were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to
    approval by local or state authorities. Of that amount,
    approximately 90 percent of our rate increases over the
    last three fiscal years have been obtained through rate making
    mechanisms that allow us to automatically refresh our rates
    without filing a formal rate case. Net annual revenue increases
    resulting from ratemaking activity totaling $40.1 million,
    $39.0 million and $6.3 million became effective in
    fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 as summarized below:

Stable
    Rate Filings

As an instrument to reduce regulatory lag, a stable rate filing
    is a regulatory mechanism designed to allow us to refresh our
    rates on a periodic basis without filing a formal rate case. As
    discussed above in the “Natural Gas Distribution Segment
    Overview,” we currently have stable rate filings in our
    Louisiana and Mississippi Divisions. The following table

Rate
    Case Filings

A rate case is a formal request from Atmos Energy to a
    state’s commission to increase rates that are charged to
    customers. Rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory
    authorities request us to justify our rates. This process is
    referred to as a “show cause” action. Adequate rates
    are intended to provide for recovery of the Company’s costs
    as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders as well as
    ensure that we continue to deliver reliable, reasonably priced
    natural gas service to our customers. The following table

In December 2006, the Louisiana Public Service Commission issued
    a staff report allowing the deferral of $4.3 million in
    operating and maintenance expenses in our Louisiana Division to
    allow recovery of all incremental operation and maintenance
    expense incurred in fiscal 2005 and 2006 in connection with our
    Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts.

In September 2006, our Mid-Tex Division filed its annual gas
    cost reconciliation with the RRC. The filing reflects
    approximately $24 million in refunds of amounts that were
    overcollected from customers between July 2005 and June 2006.
    The Mid-Tex Division received approval to refund these amounts
    over a six-month period, which began in November 2006. The
    ruling had no impact on the gross profit for the Mid-Tex
    Division.

In May 2007, our Mid-Tex Division filed a

36-month

gas
    contract review filing. This filing is mandated by prior RRC
    orders and covers the prudence of gas purchases made from
    November 2003 through October 2006, which total approximately
    $2.7 billion. An

agreed-upon

procedural schedule has been filed with the RRC, which
    established a hearing schedule beginning in December 2007.



In August 2007, our Colorado-Kansas Division agreed with the
    Colorado Office of Consumer Counsel and the staff of the
    Colorado Public Utility Commission to issue a one-time credit to
    our Colorado customers of $1.1 million on customer bills in
    January 2008.

Other
    Regulation

Each of our natural gas distribution divisions is regulated by
    various state or local public utility authorities. We are also
    subject to regulation by the United States Department of
    Transportation with respect to safety requirements in the
    operation and maintenance of our gas distribution facilities. In
    addition, our distribution operations are also subject to
    various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters.
    From time to time we receive inquiries regarding various
    environmental matters. We believe that our properties and
    operations substantially comply with and are operated in
    substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental
    statutes and regulations. There are no administrative nor
    judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality
    statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental
    agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our
    operations. Our environmental claims have arisen primarily from
    former manufactured gas plant sites in Tennessee, Iowa and
    Missouri.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allows, pursuant
    to Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, gas
    transportation services through our Atmos Pipeline —
    Texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or
    local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines,
    without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the FERC.

Competition

Although our natural gas distribution operations are not
    currently in significant direct competition with any other
    distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial
    customers within our service areas, we do compete with other
    natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for
    sales to industrial and agricultural customers. We compete in
    all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources,
    including, in particular, electricity. Electric utilities offer
    electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space
    heating, water heating and cooking markets. Promotional
    incentives, improved equipment efficiencies and promotional
    rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical
    equipment. The principal means to compete against alternative
    fuels is lower prices, and natural gas historically has
    maintained its price advantage in the residential, commercial
    and industrial markets. However, higher gas prices, coupled with
    the electric utilities’ marketing efforts, have increased
    competition for residential and commercial customers. In
    addition, AEM competes with other natural gas brokers in
    obtaining natural gas supplies for our customers.

Employees

At September 30, 2007, we had 4,653 employees,
    consisting of 4,526 employees in our regulated operations
    and 127 employees in our nonregulated operations.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Our financial and operating results are subject to a number of
    factors, many of which are not within our control. Although we
    have tried to discuss key risk factors below, please be aware
    that other risks may prove to be important in the future. These
    factors include the following:

We are
    subject to regulation by each state in which we operate that
    affect our operations and financial results.

Our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and
    storage businesses are subject to various regulated returns on
    our rate base in each jurisdiction in which we operate. We
    monitor the allowed rates of return and our effectiveness in
    earning such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating
    changes as we believe are needed. In addition, in the normal
    course of the regulatory environment, assets may be placed in
    service and historical test periods established before rate
    cases can be filed that could result in an adjustment of our
    returns. Once rate cases are filed, regulatory bodies have the
    authority to suspend implementation of the new rates while
    studying the cases. Because of this process, we must suffer the
    negative financial effects of having placed assets in service
    without the benefit of rate relief, which is commonly referred
    to as “regulatory lag”. In addition, rate cases
    involve a risk of rate reduction, because once rates have been
    approved, they are still subject to challenge for their
    reasonableness by appropriate regulatory authorities. Our debt
    and equity financings are also subject to approval by regulatory
    bodies in several states, which could limit our ability to take
    advantage of favorable market conditions.

Our business could also be affected by deregulation initiatives,
    including the development of unbundling initiatives in the
    natural gas industry. Unbundling is the separation of the
    provision and pricing of local distribution gas services into
    discrete components. It typically focuses on the separation of
    the distribution and gas supply components and the resulting
    opening of the regulated components of sales services to
    alternative unregulated suppliers of those services. Although we
    believe that our enhanced technology and distribution system
    infrastructures have positively positioned us, we cannot provide
    assurance that there would be no significant adverse effect on
    our business should unbundling or further deregulation of the
    natural gas distribution service business occur.

Our
    operations are exposed to market risks that are beyond our
    control which could adversely affect our financial
    results.

Our risk management operations are subject to market risks
    beyond our control including market liquidity, commodity price
    volatility and counterparty creditworthiness.

Although we maintain a risk management policy, we may not be
    able to completely offset the price risk associated with
    volatile gas prices or the risk in our natural gas marketing and
    pipeline and storage segments, which could lead to volatility in
    our earnings. Physical trading also introduces price risk on any
    net open positions at the end of each trading day, as well as
    volatility resulting from

intra-day

fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price
    movements between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for
    future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is
    hedged. Although we manage our business to maintain no



open positions, there are times when limited net open positions
    related to our physical storage may occur on a short-term basis.
    The determination of our net open position as of the end of any
    particular trading day requires us to make assumptions as to
    future circumstances, including the use of gas by our customers
    in relation to our anticipated storage and market positions.
    Because the price risk associated with any net open position at
    the end of such day may increase if the assumptions are not
    realized, we review these assumptions as part of our daily
    monitoring activities. Net open positions may increase
    volatility in our financial condition or results of operations
    if market prices move in a significantly favorable or
    unfavorable manner because the timing of the recognition of
    profits or losses on the hedges for financial accounting
    purposes usually do not match up with the timing of the economic
    profits or losses on the item being hedged. This volatility may
    occur with a resulting increase or decrease in earnings or
    losses, even though the expected profit margin is essentially
    unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated.
    Further, if the local physical markets in which we trade do not
    move consistently with the NYMEX futures market, we could
    experience increased volatility in the financial results of our
    natural gas marketing and pipeline and storage segments.

Our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other
    segments manage margins and limit risk exposure on the sale of
    natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixed-price purchase or
    sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through
    the use of a variety of financial derivatives. However,
    contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to
    withdraw gas from storage, which could cause us to purchase gas
    at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes
    to fulfill customer contracts. We could also realize financial
    losses on our efforts to limit risk as a result of volatility in
    the market prices of the underlying commodities or if a
    counterparty fails to perform under a contract. In addition,
    adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties
    could limit the level of trading activities with these parties
    and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a
    contract.

We are also subject to interest rate risk on our commercial
    paper borrowings. In recent years, we have been operating in a
    relatively low interest-rate environment with both short and
    long-term interest rates being relatively low compared to
    historical interest rates. However, in the last three years, the
    Federal Reserve has taken actions that have generally resulted
    in increases in short-term interest rates. Future increases in
    interest rates could adversely affect our future financial
    results.

The
    concentration of our distribution, pipeline and storage
    operations in the State of Texas has increased the exposure of
    our operations and financial results to economic conditions and
    regulatory decisions in Texas.

As a result of our acquisition of the distribution, pipeline and
    storage operations of TXU Gas in October 2004, over
    50 percent of our natural gas distribution customers and
    most of our pipeline and storage assets and operations are
    located in the State of Texas. This concentration of our
    business in Texas means that our operations and financial
    results are subject to greater impact than before from changes
    in the Texas economy in general and regulatory decisions by
    state and local regulatory authorities.

Adverse
    weather conditions could affect our operations.

Beginning in the

2006-2007

winter heating season, we have had weather-normalized rates for
    over 90 percent of our residential and commercial meters,
    which has substantially mitigated the adverse effects of
    warmer-than-normal weather for meters in those service areas.
    However, our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission
    and storage operating results may continue to vary somewhat with
    the actual temperatures during the winter heating season. In
    addition, sustained cold weather could adversely affect our
    natural gas marketing operations as we may be required to
    purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain
    sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts.

The
    execution of our business plan could be affected by an inability
    to access capital markets.

We rely upon access to both short-term and long-term capital
    markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements. Adverse changes
    in the economy or these markets, the overall health of the
    industries in which we



operate and changes to our credit ratings could limit access to
    these markets, increase our cost of capital or restrict the
    execution of our business plan.

Our long-term debt is currently rated as “investment
    grade” by Standard & Poor’s Corporation
    (S&P), Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. (Moody’s)
    and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (Fitch), the three credit rating
    agencies that rate our long-term debt securities. There can be
    no assurance that these rating agencies will maintain investment
    grade ratings for our long-term debt. If we were to lose our
    investment-grade rating, the commercial paper markets and the
    commodity derivatives markets could become unavailable to us.
    This would increase our borrowing costs for working capital and
    reduce the borrowing capacity of our gas marketing affiliate. In
    addition, if our commercial paper ratings were lowered, it would
    increase the cost of commercial paper financing and could reduce
    or eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper markets.
    If we were unable to issue commercial paper at reasonable rates,
    we would likely borrow under our bank credit facilities to meet
    our working capital needs, which would likely increase the cost
    of our working capital financing.

Inflation
    and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base
    and customer collections and increase our level of
    indebtedness.

Inflation has caused increases in some of our operating expenses
    and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs. We have
    a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our
    natural gas distribution gas rates in relation to the increasing
    cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in
    adjusting those gas rates. Historically, we have been able to
    budget and control operating expenses and investments within the
    amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to
    continue to do so. However, the ability to control expenses is
    an important factor that could influence future results.

Rapid increases in the price of purchased gas, which has
    occurred in recent years, cause us to experience a significant
    increase in short-term debt. We must pay suppliers for gas when
    it is purchased, which can be significantly in advance of when
    these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly
    customer bills for gas delivered. Increases in purchased gas
    costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts
    as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas
    bills, leading to higher than normal accounts receivable. This
    could result in higher short-term debt levels, greater
    collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.

Our
    growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our
    business, which requires extensive capital
    spending.

We must continually build additional capacity in our natural gas
    distribution system to maintain the growth in the number of our
    customers. The cost of adding this capacity may be affected by a
    number of factors, including the general state of the economy
    and weather. Our cash flows from operations generally are
    sufficient to supply funding for all our capital expenditures
    including the financing of the costs of new construction along
    with capital expenditures necessary to maintain our existing
    natural gas system. Due to the timing of these cash flows and
    capital expenditures, we often must fund at least a portion of
    these costs through borrowing funds from third party lenders,
    the cost of which is dependent on the interest rates at the
    time. This in turn may limit our ability to connect new
    customers to our system due to constraints on the amount of
    funds we can invest in our infrastructure.

Our
    operations are subject to increased competition.

In the residential and commercial customer markets, our natural
    gas distribution operations compete with other energy products,
    such as electricity and propane. Our primary product competition
    is with electricity for heating, water heating and cooking.
    Increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact
    our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of
    natural gas to the consumer. This could adversely impact our
    business if as a result, our customer growth slows, reducing our
    ability to make capital expenditures, or if our customers
    further conserve their use of gas, resulting in reduced gas
    purchases and customer billings.



In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing
    plants and agricultural customers, adverse economic conditions,
    including higher gas costs, could cause these customers to use
    alternative sources of energy, such as electricity, or bypass
    our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower

per-unit

costs. Our regulated transmission and storage operations
    currently face limited competition from other existing
    intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or
    arrange transportation, storage and other services for
    customers. However, competition may increase if new intrastate
    pipelines are constructed near our existing facilities.

The
    cost of providing pension and postretirement health care
    benefits is subject to changes in pension fund values, changing
    demographics and actuarial assumptions and may have a material
    adverse effect on our financial results.

We provide a cash-balance pension plan and postretirement
    healthcare benefits to eligible full-time employees. Our costs
    of providing such benefits is subject to changes in the market
    value of our pension fund assets, changing demographics,
    including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an
    expected increase in the number of eligible former employees
    over the next five to ten years, and various actuarial
    calculations and assumptions. The actuarial assumptions used may
    differ materially from actual results due to changing market and
    economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates and
    interest rates and other factors. These differences may result
    in a significant impact on the amount of pension expense or
    other postretirement benefit costs recorded in future periods.

We are
    subject to environmental regulations which could adversely
    affect our operations or financial results.

We are subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements
    enacted or adopted by federal, state and local governmental
    authorities relating to protection of the environment and health
    and safety matters, including those legal requirements that
    govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the
    management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, the

clean-up

of
    contaminated sites, groundwater quality and availability, plant
    and wildlife protection, as well as work practices related to
    employee health and safety. Environmental legislation also
    requires that our facilities, sites and other properties
    associated with our operations be operated, maintained,
    abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable
    regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with these laws,
    regulations, permits and licenses may expose us to fines,
    penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be
    significant to our financial results. In addition, existing
    environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may
    become subject to new regulations. Such revised or new
    regulations could result in increased compliance costs or
    additional operating restrictions which could adversely affect
    our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Distributing
    and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in
    accidents and additional operating costs.

Our natural gas distribution business involves a number of
    hazards and operating risks that cannot be completely avoided,
    such as leaks, accidents and operational problems, which could
    cause loss of human life, as well as substantial financial
    losses resulting from property damage, damage to the environment
    and to our operations. We do have liability and property
    insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks.
    However, because our pipeline, storage and distribution
    facilities are near or are in populated areas, any loss of human
    life or adverse financial results resulting from such events
    could be large. If these events were not fully covered by
    insurance, our financial position and results of operations
    could be adversely affected.

Natural
    disasters, terrorist activities or other significant events
    could adversely affect our operations or financial
    results.

Natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and
    operations. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities
    could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in
    the price of natural gas that could affect our operations. Also,
    companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure
    to actual acts of terrorism, which could subject our operations
    to increased risks. As a result, the availability of insurance



covering such risks may be more limited, which could increase
    the risk that an event could adversely affect future financial
    results.

    owned an aggregate of 76,362 miles of underground
    distribution and transmission mains throughout our gas
    distribution systems. These mains are located on easements or
    rights-of-way which generally provide for perpetual use. We
    maintain our mains through a program of continuous inspection
    and repair and believe that our system of mains is in good
    condition. Our regulated transmission and storage segment owned
    6,290 miles of gas transmission and gathering lines and our
    pipeline, storage and other segment owned 73 miles of gas
    transmission and gathering lines.

Storage
    Assets

We own underground gas storage facilities in several states to
    supplement the supply of natural gas in periods of peak demand.

ITEM 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

INTRODUCTION

This section provides management’s discussion of the
    financial condition, changes in financial condition and results
    of operations of Atmos Energy Corporation and its consolidated
    subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations
    and liquidity and capital resources. It includes
    management’s interpretation of our financial results, the
    factors affecting these results, the major factors expected to
    affect future operating results and future investment and
    financing plans. This discussion should be read in conjunction
    with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

Several factors exist that could influence our future financial
    performance, some of which are described in Item 1A above,
    “Risk Factors”. They should be considered in
    connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained
    in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since
    these factors could cause actual results and conditions to
    differ materially from those set out in such forward-looking
    statements.

Cautionary
    Statement for the Purposes of the Safe Harbor under the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

The statements contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

may contain “forward-looking statements” within the
    meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All
    statements other than statements of historical fact included in
    this Report are forward-looking statements made in good faith by
    us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from
    liability established by the Private Securities Litigation
    Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, or any other of
    our documents or oral presentations, the words
    “anticipate”, “believe”,
    “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”,
    “goal”, “intend”, “objective”,
    “plan”, “projection”, “seek”,
    “strategy” or similar words are intended to identify
    forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are
    subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
    results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in
    the statements relating to our strategy, operations, markets,
    services, rates, recovery of costs, availability of gas supply
    and other factors. These risks and uncertainties include the
    following: regulatory trends and decisions, including
    deregulation initiatives and the impact of rate proceedings
    before various state regulatory commissions; market risks beyond
    our control affecting our risk management activities including
    market liquidity, commodity price volatility, increasing
    interest rates and counterparty creditworthiness; the
    concentration of our distribution, pipeline and storage
    operations in one state; adverse weather conditions; our ability
    to continue to access the capital markets; the effects of
    inflation and changes in the availability and prices of natural
    gas, including the volatility of natural gas prices; the
    capital-intensive nature of our distribution business, increased
    competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of
    energy; increased costs of providing pension and postretirement
    health care benefits; the impact of environmental regulations on
    our business; the inherent hazards and risks involved in
    operating our distribution business, natural disasters,
    terrorist activities or other events, and other risks and
    uncertainties discussed herein, especially in Item 1A
    above, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which
    are beyond our control. Accordingly, while we believe these
    forward-looking statements to be reasonable, there can be no
    assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that
    the expectations derived from them will be realized. Further, we
    undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our
    forward-looking statements whether as a result of new
    information, future events or otherwise.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States. Preparation of these financial statements
    requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
    and the related disclosures of contingent assets and
    liabilities. We based our estimates on historical experience and
    various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
    the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our
    estimates, including those related to risk management and
    trading activities, allowance for doubtful accounts, legal and
    environmental accruals, insurance accruals, pension and
    postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes and the
    valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and
    other long-lived



assets. Our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the
    Audit Committee quarterly. Actual results may differ from
    estimates.

Regulation

— Our natural gas distribution and
    regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to
    regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of
    accounting records and various other matters by the respective
    regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. Our
    regulated operations are accounted for in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 71,

Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
    Regulation

. This statement requires cost-based,
    rate-regulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect
    the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices
    and policies of the various regulatory commissions in their
    financial statements. We record regulatory assets for costs that
    have been deferred for which future recovery through customer
    rates is considered probable. Regulatory liabilities are
    recorded when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for
    amounts that will be credited to customers through the
    ratemaking process. As a result, certain costs that would
    normally be expensed under accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States are permitted to be capitalized or
    deferred on the balance sheet because they can be recovered
    through rates. Discontinuing the application of SFAS 71
    could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer
    costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance
    sheet, which could reduce our net income. Further, regulation
    may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are
    recognized. The amounts to be recovered or recognized are based
    upon historical experience and our understanding of the
    regulations. The impact of regulation on our natural gas
    distribution operations may be affected by decisions of the
    regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations.

Revenue recognition

— Sales of natural gas to
    our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly
    cycle basis; however, the billing cycle periods for certain
    classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting
    periods used for financial reporting purposes. We follow the
    revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas
    distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas
    delivered to customers, but not yet billed under the cycle
    billing method, are estimated and accrued and the related costs
    are charged to expense. Revenue is recognized in our regulated
    transmission and storage segment as the services are provided.

On occasion, we are permitted to implement new rates that have
    not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities and are
    subject to refund. As permitted by SFAS No. 71, we
    recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that
    could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction
    in which the rates were implemented.

Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for
    increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through
    purchased gas adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas adjustment
    mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering
    purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate
    case to address all of the utility company’s non-gas costs.
    These mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory
    authorities recognize a particular type of expense, such as
    purchased gas costs, that (i) is subject to significant
    price fluctuations compared to the utility company’s other
    costs, (ii) represents a large component of the utility
    company’s cost of service and (iii) is generally
    outside the control of the gas utility company. There is no
    gross profit generated through purchased gas adjustments, but
    they provide a dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or
    decreases in utility gas costs. Although substantially all
    natural gas distribution sales to our customers fluctuate with
    the cost of gas that we purchase, our gross profit is generally
    not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas as a result of
    the purchased gas adjustment mechanism. The effects of these
    purchased gas adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas
    costs on our balance sheet.

Energy trading contracts resulting in the delivery of a
    commodity in which we are the principal in the transaction are
    recorded as natural gas marketing sales or purchases at the time
    of physical delivery. Realized gains and losses from the
    settlement of financial instruments that do not result in
    physical delivery related to our natural gas marketing energy
    trading contracts are included as a component of natural gas
    marketing revenues.

Operating revenues for our pipeline, storage and other segment
    are recognized in the period in which actual volumes are
    transported and storage services are provided.



Allowance for doubtful accounts

— We record an
    allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce
    the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to
    collect based upon our collections experiences and our
    assessment of our customers’ inability or reluctance to
    pay. However, if circumstances change, our estimate of the
    recoverability of accounts receivable could be different.
    Circumstances which could affect our estimates include, but are
    not limited to, customer credit issues, the level of natural gas
    prices and general economic conditions. Accounts are written off
    once they are deemed to be uncollectible.

Derivatives and hedging activities

— Our
    natural gas distribution segment uses a combination of physical
    storage and financial derivatives to partially insulate our
    natural gas distribution customers against gas price volatility
    during the winter heating season. These financial derivatives
    have not been designated as hedges pursuant to SFAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

. Accordingly, they are recorded at fair value.
    However, because the costs associated with and the gains and
    losses arising from these financial derivatives are included in
    our purchased gas adjustment mechanisms, changes in the fair
    value of these financial derivatives are initially recorded as a
    component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the
    consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas
    costs when the related costs are recovered through our rates in
    accordance with SFAS 71. Accordingly, there is no earnings
    impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a result of
    the use of financial derivatives.

Our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other
    segments are exposed to commodity price risk associated with our
    natural gas inventories, and, in our natural gas marketing
    segment, on our fixed-price contracts. We manage this risk
    through a combination of physical storage and financial
    derivatives, including futures, over-the-counter and
    exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties.
    Option contracts provide the right, but not the requirement, to
    buy or sell the commodity at a fixed price. Swap contracts
    require receipt of payment for the commodity based on the
    difference between a fixed price and the market price on the
    settlement date. The use of these contracts is subject to our
    risk management policies, which are monitored for compliance
    daily.

We have designated the natural gas inventory held by Atmos
    Energy Marketing and Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC as the
    hedged item in a fair-value hedge. This inventory is marked to
    market at the end of each month based on the Gas Daily index,
    with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or
    losses in revenue in the period of change. The derivatives
    associated with this natural gas inventory have been designated
    as fair value hedges and are marked to market each month based
    upon the NYMEX price with changes in fair value recognized as
    unrealized gains or losses in the period of change. The
    difference in the spot price used to value our physical
    inventory (Gas Daily) and the forward price used to value the
    related fair-value hedges (NYMEX) are reported as a component of
    revenue and can result in volatility in our reported net income.
    We have elected to exclude this

spot/forward

differential for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of
    these fair-value hedges.

We recognize revenue and the associated carrying value of the
    inventory (inclusive of storage costs) as purchased gas costs in
    our consolidated statement of income when we sell the gas and
    deliver it out of the storage facility. Over time, we expect
    gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be
    offset by gains and losses on the fair-value hedges, resulting
    in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we
    anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction.

We have elected to treat our fixed-price forward contracts as
    normal purchases and sales and have designated the associated
    derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of anticipated
    transactions. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses on these
    open derivative contracts are recorded as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income, and are recognized in
    earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are
    sold. Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred, is reported
    as a component of revenue.

Additionally, our natural gas marketing segment utilizes storage
    swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage
    opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the
    original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural
    gas inventory, basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic
    value of our fixed price and storage books and various
    over-the-counter and exchange-traded options. Although the
    purpose of these instruments is to either reduce basis or other
    risks or lock in arbitrage opportunities, these derivative



instruments have not been designated as hedges pursuant to
    SFAS 133. Accordingly, these derivative instruments are
    recorded at fair value with all changes in fair value included
    in revenue.

In addition to mitigating commodity price risk, we periodically
    manage our exposure to interest rate changes by entering into
    Treasury lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of
    the interest cost associated with anticipated financings. We
    have designated each of our previously executed Treasury lock
    agreements as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction at
    the time the agreements were executed. Accordingly, unrealized
    gains and losses associated with the Treasury lock agreements
    are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income. The realized gain or loss recognized upon settlement of
    the Treasury lock agreement is initially recorded as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income and is recognized as a
    component of interest expense over the life of the related
    financing arrangement.

The fair value of all of our financial derivatives is determined
    through a combination of prices actively quoted on national
    exchanges, prices provided by other external sources and prices
    based on models and other valuation methods. Changes in the
    valuation of our financial derivatives primarily result from
    changes in market prices, the valuation of the portfolio of our
    contracts, maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly
    originated transactions, each of which directly affect the
    estimated fair value of our derivatives. We believe the market
    prices and models used to value these derivatives represent the
    best information available with respect to closing exchange and
    over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility factors
    underlying the contracts. Values are adjusted to reflect the
    potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over
    a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions.

Impairment assessments

— We perform impairment
    assessments of our goodwill, intangible assets subject to
    amortization and long-lived assets. We currently have no
    indefinite-lived intangible assets.

We annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during
    our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise. We
    use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to
    estimate the fair value of our reporting units. We have
    determined our reporting units to be each of our natural gas
    distribution divisions and wholly-owned subsidiaries. Goodwill
    is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the
    acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill. The discounted cash
    flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are
    dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of
    future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rate. An
    impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a
    reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value.

We annually assess whether the cost of our intangible assets
    subject to amortization or other long-lived assets is
    recoverable or that the remaining useful lives may warrant
    revision. We perform this assessment more frequently when
    specific events or circumstances have occurred that suggest the
    recoverability of the cost of the intangible and other
    long-lived assets is at risk.

When such events or circumstances are present, we assess the
    recoverability of these assets by determining whether the
    carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash
    flows from the operating division or subsidiary to which these
    assets relate. These cash flow projections consider various
    factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the
    discount rate and are based upon the best information available
    at the time the estimate is made. Changes in these factors could
    materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the
    recognition of an impairment charge. An impairment charge is
    recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the
    fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less
    than the carrying value of the related asset.

Pension and other postretirement plans

—
    Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are
    determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous
    assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan
    assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed
    discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality
    data. We review the estimates and assumptions underlying our
    pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities
    annually based upon a June 30 measurement date. The assumed
    discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that
    generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs
    and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health
    care cost trend rate



and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most
    significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and
    liabilities.

The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the
    actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement
    obligation and net pension and postretirement cost. When
    establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality
    corporate bond rates based on Moody’s Aa bond index,
    changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied
    discount rate that is derived from matching our projected
    benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate bond spot
    rate curve.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in
    calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our
    annual pension and postretirement plan cost. We estimate the
    expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond
    returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of
    active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset
    rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the
    guidance from our investment advisors in making a final
    determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the
    extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the
    course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate,
    that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan cost is
    not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases
    future pension or postretirement plan cost over a period of
    approximately ten to twelve years.

We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in
    determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual
    health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted
    legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of
    retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our
    participant census information as of the measurement date.

Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and
    differences between the actual return on plan assets and the
    expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on
    the amount of pension cost ultimately recognized. A
    0.25 percent change in our discount rate would impact our
    pension and postretirement cost by approximately
    $0.9 million. A 0.25 percent change in our expected
    rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement cost
    by approximately $0.9 million.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

Overview

Atmos Energy Corporation is involved in the distribution,
    marketing and transportation of natural gas. Accordingly, our
    results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural
    gas, particularly during the winter heating season, and the
    volatility of the natural gas markets. This generally results in
    higher operating revenues and net income during the period from
    October through March of each year and lower operating revenues
    and either lower net income or net losses during the period from
    April through September of each year. As a result of the
    seasonality of the natural gas industry, our second fiscal
    quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter
    with an average of approximately 63 percent of our
    consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter
    during the three most recently completed fiscal years.
    Additionally, the seasonality of this industry impacts the
    levels of accounts receivable, accounts payable, gas stored
    underground and short-term debt balances we report at various
    time of the fiscal year.

Historically, our regulated operations arising from our natural
    gas distribution operations and, beginning in fiscal 2005, from
    our Atmos Pipeline — Texas division, contributed 65 to
    85 percent of our consolidated net income. However, in
    recent years, this contribution has declined due to the growth
    of our nonregulated natural gas marketing and pipeline and
    storage businesses coupled with lower natural gas distribution
    income. Regulated operations contributed 64 percent,
    54 percent and 80 percent to our consolidated net
    income for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005. Our consolidated
    net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across
    our business segments as follows:

The 14 percent year-over-year increase in net income during
    fiscal 2007 reflects improvements across all business segments.
    Results from our regulated operations reflect the net favorable
    impact of various ratemaking rulings in our natural gas
    distribution segment, including the implementation of WNA in our
    Mid-



Tex and Louisiana Divisions coupled with increased throughput
    and incremental gross profit margins from our North Side Loop
    and other pipeline compression projects completed in fiscal
    2006. The decrease in net income from our nonregulated
    operations primarily reflects the impact of a less volatile
    natural gas market, which reduced delivered gas margins despite
    a 31 percent increase in sales volumes. However, our
    nonregulated operations benefited from higher asset optimization
    margins, primarily in the pipeline, storage and other segment.

The nine percent year-over-year increase in net income during
    fiscal 2006 primarily reflects strong results in our
    nonregulated operations, partially offset by a decrease in our
    regulated operations. The net income from our nonregulated
    operations reflect the favorable impact of a volatile natural
    gas market, which provided increased opportunities to maximize
    delivered gas margins. Our nonregulated results were also
    favorably impacted by recording unrealized gains during fiscal
    2006 compared to recording unrealized losses in fiscal 2005. The
    decrease in net income from our regulated operations primarily
    reflects the adverse effects on our natural gas distribution
    segment of weather (adjusted for WNA) that was 13 percent
    warmer than normal, the adverse effect of Hurricane Katrina on
    our Louisiana Division and a non-recurring, noncash charge to
    impair our West Texas Division irrigation assets.

Other key financial and significant events for the year ended
    September 30, 2007 include the following:

•

In December 2006, we filed a $900 million shelf
    registration statement with the SEC that replaced our previously
    existing shelf registration statement. Upon completion of the
    filing of this registration statement, we received net proceeds
    of approximately $192 million through the issuance of
    approximately 6.3 million shares of common stock. The net
    proceeds received were used to repay a portion of our
    then-existing short-term debt balance.

•

In June 2007, we received net proceeds of approximately
    $247 million from the issuance of senior notes. The net
    proceeds received, together with $53 million of available
    cash, were used to repay our $300 million unsecured
    floating rate senior notes, which were redeemed on July 15,
    2007.

•

Our total-debt-to-capitalization ratio at September 30,
    2007 was 53.7 percent compared with 60.9 percent at
    September 30, 2006, primarily reflecting the
    $50 million reduction in long-term debt and lower
    short-term debt balances as of September 30, 2007.

•

For the year ended September 30, 2007, we generated
    $547.1 million in operating cash flow compared with
    $311.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2006,
    primarily reflecting the favorable impact of increased earnings,
    increased sales volumes attributable to colder weather during
    the period and lower natural gas prices.

•

Capital expenditures decreased to $392.4 million during the
    year ended September 30, 2007 from $425.3 million in
    the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects the absence of
    capital spending for the North Side Loop and other compression
    projects completed in fiscal 2006.

•

In March 2007, the Texas Railroad Commission issued an order in
    our Mid-Tex Division’s rate case, which prospectively
    increased annual revenues by approximately $4.8 million and
    established a permanent WNA based upon a

10-year

average effective for the months of November through April.
    However, the ruling also reduced the Mid-Tex Division’s
    total return to 7.903 percent from 8.258 percent and
    required a $2.9 million refund, inclusive of interest, of
    amounts collected from our calendar 2003 — 2005 GRIP
    filings.



See the following discussion regarding the results of operations
    for each of our business operating segments.

Year
    ended September 30, 2007 compared with year ended
    September 30, 2006

Natural
    Gas Distribution Segment

The primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas
    distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized
    rates of return, the cost of natural gas, competitive factors in
    the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas.

Our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on
    our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking
    jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and,
    ultimately, separating the recovery of our approved margins from
    customer usage patterns. Improving rate design is a long-term
    process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate
    in multiple rate jurisdictions. The “Ratemaking
    Activity” section of this

Form 10-K

describes our current rate strategy and recent ratemaking
    initiatives in more detail.

One example of our recent ratemaking initiatives involves the
    substantial separation of the recovery of our margins from
    seasonal weather patterns. Prior to fiscal 2007, seasonal
    weather patterns significantly impacted our natural gas
    distribution results. The rate design in our two most
    weather-sensitive jurisdictions, the Louisiana and Mid-Tex
    divisions, which represent approximately 60 percent of our
    natural gas distribution residential and commercial meters,
    provided for limited weather protection. During fiscal 2006, we
    received WNA in these jurisdictions, beginning with the

2006-2007

winter heating season. WNA substantially offsets the effects of
    weather that is above or below normal by allowing us to increase
    the base rate portion of customers’ bills when weather is
    warmer than normal and to decrease the base rate when weather is
    colder than normal. Accordingly, gross profit margin in our
    service areas covered by WNA should be based substantially on
    the amount of gross profit that would result from normal
    weather, despite actual weather conditions that may be either
    warmer or colder than normal. After receiving WNA in our
    Louisiana and Mid-Tex divisions, we have weather protection for
    over 90 percent of our residential and commercial meters,
    which should substantially reduce the volatility in this
    segment’s operating results.

Our natural gas distribution operations are also affected by the
    cost of natural gas. The cost of gas is passed through to our
    customers without markup. Therefore, increases in the cost of
    gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues.
    Accordingly, we believe gross profit is a better indicator of
    our financial performance than revenues. However, gross profit
    in our Texas and Mississippi service areas include franchise
    fees and gross receipts taxes, which are calculated as a
    percentage of revenue (inclusive of gas costs). Therefore, the
    amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the
    cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes. We record the
    tax expense as a component of taxes, other than income. Although
    changes in revenue-related taxes arising from changes in gas
    costs affect gross profit, over time the impact is offset within
    operating income. Timing differences exist between the
    recognition of revenue for franchise fees collected from our
    customers and the recognition of expense of franchise taxes. The
    effect of these timing differences can be significant in periods
    of volatile gas prices, particularly in our Mid-Tex Division.
    These timing differences may favorably or unfavorably affect net
    income; however, these amounts should offset over time with no
    permanent impact on net income.

Higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts
    receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense,
    and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit
    facilities resulting in higher interest expense. Finally, higher
    gas costs, as well as competitive factors in the industry and
    general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or
    use alternative energy sources.

The $27.6 million increase in natural gas distribution
    gross profit primarily reflects a nine percent increase in
    throughput and the impact of having WNA coverage for more than
    90 percent of our residential and commercial customers,
    which increased gross profit by $38.6 million. Included in
    this amount was a $10.8 million increase associated with
    the implementation of WNA in our Mid-Tex and Louisiana Divisions
    beginning with the

2006-2007

winter heating season.

As a result of the Mid-Tex rate case, our gas distribution gross
    profit increased by $5.4 million compared to the prior
    year. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in
    Mid-Tex transportation revenue as the rate case reduced the
    transportation rates for certain customer classes. The Mid-Tex
    rate case also required the refund of $2.9 million
    collected under GRIP, which reduced gross profit in the current
    year.

Favorable regulatory activity in the current year increased
    gross profit by $24.4 million, primarily due to an
    $11.8 million increase in GRIP-related recoveries and a
    $10.2 million increase from our Rate Stabilization Clause
    (RSC) filings in our Louisiana service areas. These increases
    were partially offset by an $11.6 million decrease in gross
    profit associated with regulatory rulings in our Tennessee,
    Louisiana and Virginia jurisdictions.

Offsetting these increases in gross profit was a reduction in
    revenue-related taxes. Due to a significant decline in the cost
    of gas in the current-year period compared with the prior-year
    period, franchise and state gross receipts taxes included in
    gross profit decreased approximately $1.7 million; however,
    franchise and state gross receipts tax expense recorded as a
    component of taxes, other than income decreased
    $5.4 million, which resulted in a $3.7 million
    increase in operating income when compared with the prior-year
    period.

Natural gas distribution gross profit also reflects a
    $7.5 million accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs.
    The remaining decrease in gross profit primarily is attributable
    to lower irrigation margins and a reduction in pass-through
    surcharges used to recover various costs as these costs were
    fully recovered by the end of fiscal 2006 and during fiscal 2007.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
    expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
    amortization expense, taxes, other than income, and impairment
    of long-lived assets, increased to $731.5 million for the
    year ended September 30, 2007 from $723.2 million for
    the year ended September 30, 2006.

Operation and maintenance expense, excluding the provision for
    doubtful accounts, increased $22.4 million, primarily due
    to increased employee and other administrative costs. These
    increases include the personnel and other operating costs
    associated with the transfer of our gas supply function from our
    pipeline, storage and other segment to our natural gas
    distribution segment effective January 1, 2007. Partially
    offsetting these increases was the deferral of $4.3 million
    of operation and maintenance expense in our Louisiana Division
    resulting from the Louisiana Public Service Commission’s
    ruling to allow recovery of all incremental operation and
    maintenance expense incurred in fiscal 2005 and 2006 in
    connection with our Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts.

The provision for doubtful accounts decreased $0.8 million
    to $19.8 million for the year ended September 30,
    2007. The decrease primarily was attributable to reduced
    collection risk as a result of lower natural gas prices. In the
    natural gas distribution segment, the average cost of natural
    gas for the year ended September 30, 2007 was $8.09 per
    Mcf, compared with $10.02 per Mcf for the year ended
    September 30, 2006.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased
    $12.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2007
    compared with the prior-year period. The increase was primarily
    attributable to increases in assets placed in service during
    fiscal 2007. Additionally, the increase was partially
    attributable to the absence in the current-year period of a
    $2.8 million reduction in depreciation expense recorded in
    the prior-year period arising from the Mississippi Public
    Service Commission’s decision to allow certain deferred
    costs in our rate base.

Operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2007
    included a $3.3 million noncash charge associated with the
    write-off of costs for software that will no longer be used.
    Fiscal 2006 results included a $22.9 million noncash charge
    to impair the West Texas Division irrigation properties.



Interest
    charges

Interest charges allocated to the natural gas distribution
    segment for the year ended September 30, 2007 decreased to
    $121.6 million from $126.5 million for the year ended
    September 30, 2006. The decrease primarily was attributable
    to lower average outstanding short-term debt balances in the
    current-year period compared with the prior-year period.

Regulated
    Transmission and Storage Segment

Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the
    regulated pipeline and storage operations of the Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division. The Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division transports natural gas to
    our Mid-Tex Division and third parties and manages five
    underground storage reservoirs in Texas. We also provide
    ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including
    parking arrangements, lending and sales of inventory on hand.

Similar to our natural gas distribution segment, our regulated
    transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather
    patterns, competitive factors in the energy industry and
    economic conditions in our service areas. Further, as the Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division operations supply all of the
    natural gas for our Mid-Tex Division, the results of this
    segment are highly dependent upon the natural gas requirements
    of the Mid-Tex Division. Finally, as a regulated pipeline, the
    operations of the Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division may
    be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are
    incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through
    its tariffs.

Review of
    Financial and Operating Results

Financial and operational highlights for our regulated
    transmission and storage segment for the years ended
    September 30, 2007 and 2006 are presented below.

The $22.1 million increase in gross profit primarily is
    attributable to a 23 percent increase in throughput due to
    colder weather in the current year and incremental volumes from
    the North Side Loop and other compression projects. These
    activities increased gross profit by $16.2 million, of
    which, $10.8 million was associated with our North Side
    Loop and other compression projects completed in fiscal 2006.
    Increases in gross profit also include a $3.1 million
    increase from rate adjustments resulting from our 2005 GRIP
    filing, a



$2.1 million increase from the sale of excess gas inventory
    and a $2.0 million increase from new or renegotiated
    blending and capacity enhancement contracts.

Operating expenses increased to $83.4 million for the year
    ended September 30, 2007 from $77.8 million for the
    year ended September 30, 2006 due to higher administrative
    and other operating costs primarily associated with the North
    Side Loop and other compression projects that were completed in
    fiscal 2006.

Interest
    charges

Interest charges allocated to the pipeline and storage segment
    for the year ended September 30, 2007 increased to
    $27.9 million from $22.8 million for the year ended

    use of updated allocation factors for fiscal 2007. These factors
    are reviewed and updated on an annual basis.

Natural
    Gas Marketing Segment

Our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas
    supply, arranges transportation

and/or

storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers
    at competitive prices. To facilitate this process, we utilize
    proprietary and customer-owned transportation and storage assets
    to provide the various services our customers request, including
    furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and market-based
    prices, contract negotiation and administration, load
    forecasting, gas storage acquisition and management services,
    transportation services, peaking sales and balancing services,
    capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through
    the use of derivative products. As a result, revenues and gross
    profit from this segment arise from the types of commercial
    transactions we have structured with our customers and include
    the value we extract by optimizing the storage and
    transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues
    for services we perform.

To optimize the storage and transportation capacity we own or
    control, we participate in transactions in which we combine the
    natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our
    costs incurred to serve our customers by identifying the lowest
    cost alternative within the natural gas supplies, transportation
    and markets to which we have access. Additionally, we engage in
    natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and
    profit from the pricing differences that occur over time. We
    purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial contracts
    at favorable prices to lock in gross profit margins. Through the
    use of transportation and storage services and derivative
    contracts, we seek to capture gross profit margin through the
    arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by
    recognizing pricing differences that occur over time.

AEM continually manages its net physical position to enhance the
    future economic profit it captured when an original transaction
    was executed. Therefore, AEM may change its scheduled injection
    and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on
    market conditions or adjust the amount of storage capacity it
    holds on a discretionary basis in an effort to achieve this
    objective.

The natural gas inventory used in our natural gas marketing
    storage activities is marked to market at the end of each month
    based upon the Gas Daily index with changes in fair value
    recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of
    change. We use derivatives, designated as fair value hedges, to
    hedge this natural gas inventory. These derivatives are marked
    to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with changes in
    fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the
    period of change. The changes between the spreads between the
    forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges
    designated against our physical inventory and the market (spot)
    prices used to value our physical storage result in the
    unrealized margins reported as a part of our storage activities
    until the underlying physical gas is cycled and the related
    financial derivatives are settled.

AEM also uses derivative instruments to capture additional
    storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the
    execution of the original physical inventory hedge and to
    insulate and protect the economic value within its storage and
    marketing activities. Changes in fair value associated with
    these financial



instruments are recognized as unrealized gains and losses within
    AEM’s storage and marketing activities until they are
    settled.

Review of
    Financial and Operating Results

Financial and operational highlights for our natural gas
    marketing segment for the years ended September 30, 2007
    and 2006 are presented below. Gross profit margin for our
    natural gas marketing segment consists primarily of margins
    earned from the delivery of gas and related services requested
    by our customers; and asset optimization activities, which are
    derived from the utilization of our managed proprietary and
    third party storage and transportation assets to capture
    favorable arbitrage spreads through natural gas trading
    activities.

Unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses on
    the derivative contracts used by our natural gas marketing
    segment to manage commodity price risk as described above. These
    margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the
    physical and forward natural gas prices. Generally, if the
    physical/financial spread narrows, we will record unrealized
    gains or lower unrealized losses. If the physical/financial
    spread widens, we will record unrealized losses or lower
    unrealized gains. The magnitude of the unrealized gains and
    losses is also contingent upon the levels of our net physical
    position at the end of the reporting period.

The $26.3 million decrease in our natural gas marketing
    segment’s gross profit primarily reflects lower delivered
    gas margins, partially offset by higher asset optimization
    margins.

Delivered gas margins decreased $30.2 million compared with
    the prior-year period. This decrease reflects the impact of a
    less volatile market, which reduced opportunities to take
    advantage of pricing differences between hubs, partially offset
    by a 31 percent increase in sales volumes attributable to
    successful execution of our marketing strategies and colder
    weather in the current fiscal year compared with the prior year.

Asset optimization margins increased $2.6 million compared
    with the prior-year period. The increase reflects greater cycled
    storage volumes during the current-year period, partially offset
    by an increase in storage fees and park and loan fees which
    reduced the arbitrage spreads available.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
    expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
    amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes,
    increased to $29.3 million for the



year ended September 30, 2007 from $28.4 million for
    the year ended September 30, 2006. The increase in
    operating expense primarily was attributable to an increase in
    employee and other administrative costs.

Miscellaneous
    income

Miscellaneous income increased to $6.4 million for the year
    ended September 30, 2007 from $2.6 million for the
    year ended September 30, 2006. The increase primarily was
    attributable to increased investment income earned on overnight
    investments during the current-year period combined with
    increased interest income earned on our margin account
    associated with increased margin requirements during the current
    year.

Interest
    charges

Interest charges for the year ended September 30, 2007
    decreased to $5.8 million from $8.5 million for the
    year ended September 30, 2006. The decrease was
    attributable to lower borrowing requirements during the
    current-year period.

Economic
    Gross Profit

AEM monitors the impacts of its asset optimization efforts by
    estimating the gross profit that it captured through the
    purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the associated
    financial derivatives. The reconciliation below of the economic
    gross profit, combined with the effect of unrealized gains or
    losses recognized in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles in the financial statements in prior
    periods, is presented to provide a measure of the potential
    gross profit from asset optimization that could occur in future
    periods if AEM’s optimization efforts are executed as
    planned. We consider this measure of potential gross profit a
    non-GAAP financial measure as it is calculated using both
    forward-looking and historical financial information. The
    following table presents AEM’s economic gross profit and
    its potential gross profit for the last three fiscal years.

As of September 30, 2007, based upon AEM’s derivatives
    position and inventory withdrawal schedule, the economic gross
    profit was $40.8 million. This amount is reduced by
    $10.8 million of net unrealized gains recorded in the
    financial statements as of September 30, 2007 that will
    reverse when the inventory is withdrawn and the accompanying
    financial derivatives are settled. Therefore, the potential
    gross profit was $30.0 million. This potential gross profit
    amount will not result in an equal increase in future net income
    as AEM will incur additional storage and other operational
    expenses and increased income taxes to realize this amount.

The economic gross profit is based upon planned injection and
    withdrawal schedules, and the realization of the economic gross
    profit is contingent upon the execution of this plan, weather
    and other execution factors. Since AEM actively manages and
    optimizes its portfolio to enhance the future profitability of
    its storage position, it may change its scheduled injection and
    withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market
    conditions. Therefore, we cannot ensure that the economic gross
    profit or the potential gross profit calculated as of
    September 30, 2007 will be fully realized in the future or
    in what time period. Further, if we experience operational or
    other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our
    stored gas positions, our earnings could be adversely impacted.



Pipeline,
    Storage and Other Segment

Our pipeline, storage and other segment primarily consists of
    the operations of Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC (APS), Atmos
    Energy Services, LLC (AES) and Atmos Power Systems, Inc., which
    are each wholly-owned by AEH.

APS owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in
    Kentucky and Louisiana. We use these storage facilities to
    reduce the need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to
    meet customer demand during peak periods. Additionally,
    beginning in fiscal 2006, APS initiated activities in the
    natural gas gathering business. As of September 30, 2007,
    these activities were limited in nature.

AES, through December 31, 2006, provided natural gas
    management services to our natural gas distribution operations,
    other than the Mid-Tex Division. These services included
    aggregating and purchasing gas supply, arranging transportation
    and storage logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our
    natural gas distribution service areas at competitive prices.
    Effective January 1, 2007, these activities were moved to
    our shared services function included in our natural gas
    distribution segment. AES continues to provide limited services
    to our natural gas distribution divisions, and the revenues AES
    receives are equal to the costs incurred to provide those
    services.

Through Atmos Power Systems, Inc., we have constructed electric
    peaking power-generating plants and associated facilities and
    lease these plants through lease agreements that are accounted
    for as sales under generally accepted accounting principles.

Results for this segment are primarily impacted by seasonal
    weather patterns and volatility in the natural gas markets.
    Additionally, this segment’s results include an unrealized
    component as APS hedges its risk associated with its asset
    optimization activities.

    from its asset optimization activities, an increase in asset
    optimization contracts and increased transportation margins.



Operating expenses increased to $10.4 million for the year
    ended September 30, 2007 from $9.6 million for the
    year ended September 30, 2006 primarily due to a
    $3.0 million noncash charge associated with the write-off
    of costs associated with a natural gas gathering project. This
    increase was partially offset by a decrease in employee and
    other administrative costs associated with the transfer of gas
    supply operations from the pipeline, storage and other segment
    to our natural gas distribution segment effective
    January 1, 2007.

Miscellaneous
    income

Miscellaneous income increased to $8.2 million for the year

Adjusted for service areas that have weather-normalized
    operations. For service areas that have weather normalized
    operations, normal degree days are used instead of actual degree
    days in computing the total number of heating degree days.

Natural gas distribution gross profit increased to
    $925.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2006
    from $907.4 million for the year ended September 30,
    2005. Total throughput for our natural gas distribution business
    was 394.0 Bcf during the current year compared to
    411.1 Bcf in the prior year.

The increase in natural gas distribution gross profit, despite
    lower throughput, primarily reflects higher franchise fees and
    state gross receipts taxes, which are paid by customers and have
    no permanent effect on net income. Additionally, margins
    increased approximately $14.0 million due to rate increases
    received from our fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 GRIP filings and
    the recognition of $3.3 million that had been previously
    deferred in Louisiana following the LPSC’s ratification of
    our agreement in May 2006. These increases were partially offset
    by approximately $22.9 million due to the impact of
    significantly warmer than normal weather, particularly in our
    Mid-Tex and Louisiana divisions. For the year ended
    September 30, 2006, weather was 13 percent warmer than
    normal, as adjusted for jurisdictions with weather-normalized
    operations and two percent warmer than the prior year. In the
    Mid-Tex and Louisiana Divisions, which did not have
    weather-normalized rates during the

2005-2006

winter heating season, weather was 28 percent and
    22 percent warmer than normal.

Additionally, natural gas distribution gross profit decreased
    approximately $2.9 million compared with the prior year in
    the Louisiana Division due to the impact of Hurricane Katrina.
    Service has been restored in some areas affected by the storm;
    however, it is likely that service will not be restored to all
    of the affected service areas. As more fully described under
    Ratemaking Activity, we implemented new rates in September 2006
    that reflect the impact of Hurricane Katrina.

Operating expenses increased to $723.2 million for the year
    ended September 30, 2006 from $671.0 million for the
    year ended September 30, 2005. The increase reflects a
    $13.3 million increase in taxes, other than income,
    primarily related to franchise fees and state gross receipts
    taxes, both of which are calculated as a percentage of revenue,
    and are paid by our customers as a component of their monthly
    bills. Although these amounts are included as a component of
    revenue in accordance with our tariffs, timing differences
    between when these amounts are billed to our customers and when
    we recognize the associated expense may affect net income
    favorably or unfavorably on a temporary basis. However, there is
    no permanent effect on net income.

Operation and maintenance expense, excluding the provision for
    doubtful accounts, increased $7.8 million primarily due to
    higher employee costs associated with increased headcount to
    fill positions that were previously outsourced to a third party,
    higher medical and dental claims and increased pension and



postretirement costs resulting from changes in the assumptions
    used to determine our fiscal 2006 costs. Increased line locate,
    telecommunication and facilities costs also contributed to the
    overall increase. These increases were partially offset by a
    reduction in third-party costs for outsourced administrative and
    meter reading functions that were in-sourced during fiscal 2006.
    Operation and maintenance expense for the year ended
    September 30, 2006 was also favorably impacted by the
    absence of $2.1 million of merger and integration cost
    amortization associated with the merger of United Cities Gas
    Company in July 1997, as these costs were fully amortized by
    December 2004.

The provision for doubtful accounts increased $3.1 million
    to $20.6 million for the year ended September 30,
    2006, compared with $17.5 million in the prior year. The
    increase was primarily attributable to increased collection risk
    associated with higher natural gas prices. In the natural gas
    distribution segment, the average cost of natural gas for the
    year ended September 30, 2006 was $10.02 per Mcf, compared
    with $7.41 per Mcf for the year ended September 30, 2005.

Additionally, during the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the MPSC,
    in connection with the modification of our rate design, decided
    to allow the recovery of $2.8 million in deferred costs,
    which it had originally disallowed in its September 2004
    decision. This charge was originally recorded in fiscal 2004.
    This ruling decreased our depreciation expense during the year
    ended September 30, 2006. This decrease was offset by
    increased depreciation expense associated with the placement of
    various capital projects into service during the fiscal year.

Operating expenses were also impacted by a $22.9 million
    noncash charge to impair our West Texas Division’s
    irrigation assets. During the fiscal 2006 fourth quarter, we
    determined that, as a result of declining irrigation sales
    primarily associated with our agricultural customers’ shift
    from gas-powered pumps to electric pumps, the West Texas
    Division’s irrigation assets would not be able to generate
    sufficient future cash flows from operations to recover the net
    investment in these assets. Therefore, the entire net book value
    was written off. We will continue to operate these assets until
    we determine a plan for these assets as we are obligated to
    provide natural gas services to certain customers served by
    these assets. We are currently evaluating an opportunity to sell
    these assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. We do not
    expect the outcome of this potential transaction to materially
    affect our results of operations.

As a result of the aforementioned factors, our natural gas
    distribution segment operating income for the year ended
    September 30, 2006 decreased to $201.9 million from
    $236.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2005.

Miscellaneous
    income

Miscellaneous income for the year ended September 30, 2006
    was $9.5 million compared to miscellaneous income of
    $6.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2005.
    This increase was primarily attributable to increased interest
    income on intercompany borrowings to our natural gas marketing
    segment to fund its working capital needs. This increase was
    partially offset by a $3.3 million charge recorded during
    the fiscal 2006 second quarter associated with an adverse ruling
    in Tennessee related to the calculation of a performance-based
    rate mechanism associated with gas purchases.

Interest
    charges

Interest charges allocated to the natural gas distribution
    segment for the year ended September 30, 2006 increased to
    $126.5 million from $112.4 million for the year ended
    September 30, 2005. The increase was attributable to higher
    average outstanding short-term debt balances to fund natural gas
    purchases at significantly higher prices coupled with an
    approximate 200 basis point increase in the interest rate
    on our $300 million unsecured floating rate Senior Notes
    due 2007 due to an increase in the three-month LIBOR rate. These
    increases were partially offset by $4.8 million of interest
    savings arising from the early payoff of $72.5 million of
    our First Mortgage Bonds in June 2005.

Gross profit increased to $141.1 million for the year ended
    September 30, 2006 from $138.0 million for the year
    ended September 30, 2005. Total pipeline transportation
    volumes were 581.3 Bcf during the year ended
    September 30, 2006, compared with 554.5 Bcf for the
    prior year. Excluding intersegment transportation volumes, total
    pipeline transportation volumes were 410.5 Bcf during the
    current year compared with 373.9 Bcf in the prior year.

The increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to
    increased third-party throughput and ancillary service margins.
    The increase in third-party transportation margins was primarily
    attributable to increases in the electric-generation market due
    to the warmer than normal temperatures during the summer of
    2006, increased demand for through-system transportation
    services due to a widening of pricing differentials between the
    pipeline’s hubs and the impact of Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas’ North Side Loop and other
    compression projects that were placed into service in June 2006.
    Storage and parking and lending services on Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas also increased during fiscal 2006 as
    a result of the widening of pricing differentials between the
    pipeline’s hubs, which increased the attractiveness of
    storing gas on the pipeline and our ability to obtain improved
    margins for these services. The increases on Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas’ system were partially offset by
    a decrease in margins earned from intercompany transportation
    services to our Mid-Tex Division due to the significantly warmer
    than normal weather experienced during fiscal 2006.
    Additionally, these increases were partially offset by the
    absence of inventory sales of $3.0 million realized in the
    prior year.

Operating expenses increased to $77.8 million for the year
    ended September 30, 2006 from $72.2 million for the
    year ended September 30, 2005 due to higher employee
    benefit costs associated with an increase in headcount,
    increased pension and postretirement costs resulting from
    changes in the assumptions used to determine our fiscal 2006
    costs, higher facilities costs and higher pipeline integrity
    costs.

As a result of the aforementioned factors, our regulated
    transmission and storage segment operating income for the year
    ended September 30, 2006 decreased to $63.3 million
    from $65.8 million for the year ended September 30,
    2005.

The $68.7 million increase in our natural gas marketing
    segment’s gross profit reflects increased delivered gas
    margins and increased unrealized margins partially offset by a
    decrease in asset optimization margins.

Delivered gas margins increased $27.3 million during fiscal
    2006 as a result of increased sales volumes resulting from
    focusing our marketing efforts on higher margin opportunities
    partially offset by warmer-than-normal weather across our market
    areas. The increase in gas delivery margins also reflected our
    ability to successfully capture increased per unit margins in
    certain market areas that experienced higher market volatility.

Asset optimization margins decreased $1.8 million primarily
    due to the realization of less favorable arbitrage spreads
    during the current year period compared with the prior year,
    coupled with increased storage fees.

The favorable unrealized margin variance primarily was due to a
    favorable movement during the year ended September 30, 2006
    in the forward natural gas prices associated with financial
    derivatives used in our gas delivery activities, a narrowing of
    the physical/forward spreads during fiscal 2006 and positive
    basis ineffectiveness on our financial derivatives. These
    results were magnified by a 7.6 Bcf increase in our net
    physical position at September 30, 2006 compared to the
    prior year.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
    expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
    amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes,
    increased to $28.4 million for the year ended
    September 30, 2006 from $21.0 million for the year
    ended September 30, 2005. The increase in operating expense
    primarily was attributable to an increase in personnel costs due
    to increased headcount and an increase in regulatory compliance
    costs.

The improved gross profit margin partially offset by higher
    operating expenses resulted in an increase in our natural gas
    marketing segment operating income to $102.2 million for
    the year ended September 30, 2006 compared with operating
    income of $41.0 million for the year ended
    September 30, 2005.



Interest
    charges

Interest charges allocated to the natural gas marketing segment
    for the year ended September 30, 2006 increased to
    $8.5 million from $3.4 million for the year ended
    September 30, 2005. The increase was attributable to higher
    average outstanding debt balances to fund natural gas purchases
    at significantly higher prices.

Gross profit increased to $24.5 million for the year ended
    September 30, 2006 from $13.7 million for the year
    ended September 30, 2005. The increase in gross profit was
    primarily attributable to increased unrealized gains recorded
    during fiscal 2006 as favorable movements in the forward natural
    gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against
    the physical inventory underlying these contracts resulted in an
    unrealized gain compared with an unrealized loss in the prior
    year. Additionally, APS recorded increased margins from its
    asset optimization activities due to its ability to capture more
    favorable arbitrage spreads.

Operating expenses increased to $9.6 million for the year
    ended September 30, 2006 from $8.5 million for the
    year ended September 30, 2005 due to higher employee and
    other administrative costs.

As a result of the aforementioned factors, our pipeline, storage
    and other segment operating income for the year ended
    September 30, 2006 increased to $14.9 million from
    $5.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2005.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit
    facilities and commercial paper program generally provide the
    liquidity needed to fund our working capital, capital
    expenditures and other cash needs. Additionally, from time to
    time, we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital
    markets through our existing shelf registration statement to
    fund our liquidity needs.



Cash
    Flows

Our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a
    number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These
    include regulatory changes, the price for our services, the
    demand for our services, margin requirements resulting from
    significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks and
    other factors.

Cash
    flows from operating activities

Year-over-year changes in our operating cash flows are primarily
    attributable to working capital changes within our natural gas
    distribution segment resulting from the impact of the price of
    natural gas and the timing of customer collections, payments for
    natural gas purchases, deferred gas cost recoveries and weather.

For the year ended September 30, 2007, we generated
    operating cash flow of $547.1 million compared with
    $311.4 million in fiscal 2006 and $386.9 million in
    fiscal 2005. The significant factors impacting our operating
    cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below.

Year
    ended September 30, 2007

Fiscal 2007 operating cash flows reflect the favorable timing of
    payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities, which
    increased operating cash flow by $107.6 million.
    Additionally, improved management of our deferred gas cost
    balances increased operating cash flow by $125.2 million.
    Finally, increased net income and other favorable working
    capital changes contributed to the increase in operating cash
    flow. Partially offsetting these increases in operating cash
    flow was a decrease in customer collections of
    $84.8 million due to the decrease in the price of natural
    gas during the current year.

Year
    ended September 30, 2006

Fiscal 2006 operating cash flows reflect the adverse impact of
    significantly higher natural gas prices. Year-over-year,
    unfavorable timing of payments for accounts payable and other
    accrued liabilities reduced operating cash flow by
    $523.0 million. Partially offsetting these outflows were
    higher customer collections ($245.1 million) and reduced
    payments for natural gas inventories ($102.1 million).
    Additionally, favorable movements in the market indices used to
    value our natural gas marketing segment risk management assets
    and liabilities reduced the amount that we were required to
    deposit in a margin account and therefore favorably affected
    operating cash flow by $126.3 million.

Year
    ended September 30, 2005

Fiscal 2005 operating cash flows reflect the effects of a
    $49.6 million increase in net income and effective working
    capital management partially offset by higher natural gas
    prices. Working capital management efforts, which affected the
    timing of payments for accounts payable and other accrued
    liabilities, favorably affected operating cash flow by
    $354.1 million. However, these efforts were partially
    offset by reduced cash flow generated from accounts receivable
    changes by $168.9 million, primarily attributable to higher
    natural gas prices, and an increase in our natural gas
    inventories attributable to a 13 percent year-over-year
    increase in natural gas prices coupled with increased natural
    gas inventory levels, which reduced operating cash flow by
    $81.8 million. Operating cash flow was also adversely
    impacted by unfavorable movements in the indices used to value
    our natural gas marketing segment risk management assets and
    liabilities, which resulted in a net liability for the segment.
    Accordingly, under the terms of the associated derivative
    contracts, we were required to deposit $81.0 million into a
    margin account.

Cash
    flows from investing activities

In recent years, a substantial portion of our cash resources has
    been used to fund acquisitions and growth projects, our ongoing
    construction program and improvements to information systems.
    Our ongoing construction program enables us to provide natural
    gas distribution services to our existing customer base, expand
    our natural gas distribution services into new markets, enhance
    the integrity of our pipelines and, more recently, expand our
    intrastate pipeline network. In executing our current rate
    strategy, we are directing discretionary



capital spending to jurisdictions that permit us to earn a
    return on our investment timely. Currently, our Mid-Tex,
    Louisiana, Mississippi and West Texas natural gas distribution
    divisions and our Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division have
    rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their
    rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without
    being required to file a rate case.

For the year ended September 30, 2007, we incurred
    $392.4 million for capital expenditures compared with
    $425.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2006
    and $333.2 million for the year ended September 30,
    2005. The decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2007
    primarily reflects the absence of capital expenditures
    associated with our North Side Loop and other pipeline
    compression projects, which were completed during the fiscal
    2006 third quarter. Our cash used for investing activities for
    the year ended September 30, 2005 reflects the
    $1.9 billion cash paid for the TXU Gas acquisition,
    including related transaction costs and expenses.

Cash
    flows from financing activities

For the year ended September 30, 2007, our financing
    activities used $159.3 million in cash compared with
    $155.3 million and $1.7 billion provided for the years
    ended September 30, 2006 and 2005. Our significant
    financing activities for the years ended September 30,
    2007, 2006 and 2005 are summarized as follows:

•

In December 2006, we raised net proceeds of approximately
    $192 million from the sale of approximately
    6.3 million shares of common stock, including the
    underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option of
    0.8 million shares, under a shelf registration statement
    filed with the SEC in December 2006. The net proceeds from this
    issuance were used to reduce our then-existing short-term debt
    balance.

•

In June 2007, we issued $250 million of 6.35% Senior
    Notes due 2017. The effective interest rate of this offering,
    inclusive of all debt issue costs, was 6.45 percent. After
    giving effect to the settlement of our $100 million
    Treasury lock agreement in June 2007, the effective rate on
    these senior notes was reduced to 6.26 percent. We used the
    net proceeds of $247 million, together with
    $53 million of available cash, to repay our
    $300 million unsecured floating rate senior notes, which
    were redeemed on July 15, 2007.

•

During the years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, we
    increased our borrowings under our short-term facilities by
    $237.6 million and $144.8 million whereas during the
    year ended September 30, 2007, we repaid a net
    $213.2 million under our short-term facilities. Net
    borrowings under our short-term facilities during fiscal 2006
    and 2005 reflect the impact of seasonal natural gas purchases
    and the effect of higher natural gas prices.

•

We repaid $303.2 million of long-term debt during the year
    ended September 30, 2007, compared with $3.3 million
    during the year ended September 30, 2006 and
    $103.4 million during the year ended September 30,
    2005. Fiscal 2005 payments reflected the repayment of
    $72.5 million of our First Mortgage Bonds. In connection
    with this repayment we paid a $25.0 million make-whole
    premium in accordance with the terms of the agreements and
    accrued interest of approximately $1.0 million.

•

During the year ended September 30, 2007, we paid
    $111.7 million in cash dividends compared with dividend
    payments of $102.3 million and $99.0 million for the
    years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005. The increase in
    dividends paid over the prior-year period reflects the increase
    in our dividend rate from $1.26 per share during fiscal 2006 to
    $1.28 per share during fiscal 2007, combined with a
    7.6 million increase in shares outstanding due to share
    issuances in connection with our December 2006 equity offering
    and new share issuances under our various plans.

•

In October 2004, we sold a total of 16.1 million shares of
    common stock, including the underwriters’ exercise of their
    overallotment option, generating net proceeds of approximately
    $382 million. Additionally, we issued $1.39 billion of
    senior unsecured debt. The net proceeds from these issuances,
    combined with the net proceeds of $235.7 million from a
    July 2004 common stock offering were used to finance the
    acquisition of our Mid-Tex and Atmos Pipeline — Texas
    divisions and settle Treasury lock agreements, into which we
    entered to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost
    of financing associated with $875 million of the
    $1.39 billion long-term debt we issued.



In addition to the December 2006 equity offering described
    above, during the year ended September 30, 2007 we issued
    0.9 million shares of common stock which generated net
    proceeds of $24.9 million. In addition, we granted
    0.4 million shares of common stock under our 1998 Long-Term
    Incentive Plan to directors, officers and other participants in
    the plan. The following table shows the number of shares issued
    for the years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005:

Credit
    Facilities

As of September 30, 2007, we had a total of approximately
    $1.5 billion of credit facilities, comprised of three
    short-term committed credit facilities totaling
    $918 million, one uncommitted credit facility totaling
    $25 million and, through AEM, a second uncommitted credit
    facility that can provide up to $580 million. Borrowings
    under our uncommitted credit facilities are made on a

when-and-as-needed

basis at the discretion of the banks. Our credit capacity and
    the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the
    seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our short-term
    borrowing requirements, which are typically highest during
    colder winter months. Our working capital needs can vary
    significantly due to changes in the price of natural gas charged
    by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required to meet
    customers’ needs during periods of cold weather.

As of September 30, 2007, the amount available to us under
    our credit facilities, net of outstanding letters of credit, was
    $908.8 million. We believe these credit facilities,
    combined with our operating cash flows will be sufficient to
    fund our working capital needs. These facilities are described
    in further detail in Note 6 to the consolidated financial
    statements.

Shelf
    Registration

On December 4, 2006, we filed a registration statement with
    the SEC to issue, from time to time, up to $900 million in
    common stock

and/or

debt
    securities available for issuance, including approximately
    $401.5 million of capacity carried over from our prior
    shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2004.

In December 2006, we sold approximately 6.3 million shares
    of common stock in an equity offering under the registration
    statement and used the net proceeds to reduce short-term debt.
    In June 2007, we issued $250 million of 6.35% Senior
    Notes due 2017 in a debt offering under the registration
    statement. The net proceeds of approximately $247 million,
    together with $53 million of available cash, were used to
    repay our $300 million unsecured floating rate senior notes
    in July 2007.

After these issuances, we have approximately $450 million
    of availability remaining under the registration statement.
    However, due to certain restrictions imposed by one state
    regulatory commission on our ability to issue securities under
    the registration statement, we now have remaining and available
    for issuance a total of approximately $100 million of
    equity securities, $50 million of senior debt securities
    and $300 million of subordinated debt securities. In
    addition, due to restrictions imposed by another state
    regulatory commission, if the credit ratings on our senior
    unsecured debt were to fall below investment grade from either
    Standard &



Poor’s Corporation (BBB-), Moody’s Investors Services,
    Inc. (Baa3) or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (BBB-), our ability to issue
    any type of debt securities under the registration statement
    would be suspended until an investment grade rating from all
    three credit rating agencies was achieved.

Credit
    Ratings

Our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain
    short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the cost of
    such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating
    agencies consider a number of quantitative factors, including
    debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to
    outstanding debt, operating cash flow coverage of interest and
    pension liabilities and funding status. In addition, the rating
    agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our
    earnings over time, the quality of our management and business
    strategy, the risks associated with our regulated and
    nonregulated businesses and the regulatory structures that
    govern our rates in the states where we operate.

Our debt is rated by three rating agencies: Standard &
    Poor’s Corporation (S&P), Moody’s Investors
    Services, Inc. (Moody’s) and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (Fitch).
    Our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and
    are as follows:

S&P

Moody’s

Fitch

Unsecured senior long-term debt

BBB

Baa3

BBB+

Commercial paper

A-2

P-3

F-2

Currently, with respect to our unsecured senior long-term debt,
    Moody’s and Fitch maintain their stable outlook and
    S&P maintains its positive outlook. None of our ratings is
    currently under review.

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
    securities. The highest investment grade credit rating for
    S&P is AAA, Moody’s is Aaa and Fitch is AAA. The
    lowest investment grade credit rating for S&P is BBB-,
    Moody’s is Baa3 and Fitch is BBB-. Our credit ratings may
    be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies, and
    each rating should be evaluated independent of any other rating.
    There can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect
    for any given period of time or that a rating will not be
    lowered, or withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its
    judgment, circumstances so warrant.

Debt
    Covenants

We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of
    September 30, 2007. Our debt covenants are described in
    Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, including
    short-term debt, was 53.7 percent and 60.9 percent at
    September 30, 2007 and 2006. The decrease in the debt to
    capitalization ratio primarily reflects the favorable impact of
    our December 2006 equity offering and the reduction in
    short-term and long-term debt as of September 30, 2007. Our
    ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater
    during the winter heating season as we make additional
    short-term borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our
    working capital requirements. We intend to maintain our
    capitalization ratio in a target range of 50 to 55 percent



through cash flow generated from operations, continued issuance
    of new common stock under our Direct Stock Purchase Plan and
    Retirement Savings Plan and access to the equity capital markets.

AEM has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural
    gas under contracts indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed
    price contracts. At September 30, 2007, AEM was committed
    to purchase 80.4 Bcf within one year, 38.1 Bcf within
    one to three years and 1.4 Bcf after three years under
    indexed contracts. AEM was committed to purchase 2.4 Bcf
    within one year and 0.1 Bcf within one to three years under
    fixed price contracts with prices ranging from $5.69 to $9.85
    per Mcf.

With the exception of our Mid-Tex Division, our natural gas
    distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several
    vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year.
    Commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under
    these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated
    prices. Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as
    necessary during the month in accordance with the



terms of the individual contract. Our Mid-Tex Division maintains
    long-term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas
    for our customers in its service area which obligate it to
    purchase specified volumes at market prices. The estimated
    commitments under these contract terms as of September 30,
    2007 are reflected in the table above.

Risk
    Management Activities

We conduct risk management activities through our natural gas
    distribution, natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and
    other segments. In our natural gas distribution segment, we use
    a combination of physical storage, fixed physical contracts and
    fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually
    large winter-period gas price increases. In our natural gas
    marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments, we manage
    our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock
    in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and
    financial derivatives, including futures, over-the-counter and
    exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties.
    To the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual
    purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market
    indices we use in our hedges, we could experience
    ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting
    requirements for hedge accounting, resulting in the derivatives
    being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings.

We record our derivatives as a component of risk management
    assets and liabilities, which are classified as current or
    noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the
    underlying derivative. Substantially all of our derivative
    financial instruments are valued using external market quotes
    and indices. The following table shows the components of the
    change in fair value of our natural gas distribution and natural
    gas marketing derivative contract activities for the year ended

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits Obligations

Net
    Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit Costs

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, our total net
    periodic pension and other benefits costs was
    $48.6 million, compared with $50.0 million and
    $36.4 million for the years ended September 30, 2006
    and 2005. These costs relating to our natural gas distribution
    operations are recoverable through our gas distribution rates;
    however, a portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas
    distribution rate base. The remaining costs are recorded as a
    component of operation and maintenance expense.



The decrease in total net periodic pension and other benefits
    cost during fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 primarily
    reflects changes in assumptions we made during our annual
    pension plan valuation completed June 30, 2006. The
    discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan’s
    liabilities generally is based on rates of high-grade corporate
    bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which
    the benefits will be paid. In the period leading up to our
    June 30, 2006 measurement date, these interest rates were
    increasing, which resulted in a 130 basis point increase in
    our discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2007 net
    periodic and post-retirement cost to 6.30 percent. This
    increase had the effect of decreasing the present value of our
    plan liabilities and associated expenses. This favorable impact
    was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of reducing the
    expected return on our pension plan assets by 25 basis
    points to 8.25 percent, which has the effect of increasing
    our pension and postretirement benefit cost.

The increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits
    cost during fiscal 2006 compared with the prior year primarily
    reflects changes in assumptions we made during our annual
    pension plan valuation completed June 30, 2005. The
    discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan’s
    liabilities generally is based on rates of high-grade corporate
    bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which
    the benefits will be paid. In the period leading up to our
    June 30, 2005 measurement date, these interest rates were
    declining, which resulted in a 125 basis point reduction in
    our discount rate to 5.0 percent. This reduction increased
    the present value of our plan liabilities and associated
    expenses. Additionally, we reduced the expected return on our
    pension plan assets by 25 basis points to 8.5 percent,
    which also increased our pension and postretirement benefit cost.

Pension
    and Postretirement Plan Funding

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an
    amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. However, additional
    voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered
    necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for
    benefits attributed to service to date but also for those
    expected to be earned in the future.

During fiscal 2007, we did not contribute to our pension plans.
    During fiscal 2006, we voluntarily contributed $2.9 million
    to the Atmos Energy Corporation Retirement Plan for Mississippi
    Valley Gas Union Employees. That contribution achieved a desired
    level of funding by satisfying the minimum funding requirements
    while maximizing the tax deductible contribution for this plan
    for plan year 2005. During fiscal 2005, we voluntarily
    contributed $3.0 million to the Master Trust to maintain
    the level of funding we desire relative to our accumulated
    benefit obligation. We made the contribution because declining
    high yield corporate bond yields in the period leading up to our
    June 30, 2005 measurement date resulted in an increase in
    the present value of our plan liabilities.

We contributed $11.8 million, $10.9 million and
    $10.0 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the
    years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005. The
    contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs
    we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum
    funding required by state regulatory commissions.

Outlook
    for Fiscal 2008

Market conditions as of the June 30, 2007 valuation date
    were similar to market conditions as of our June 30, 2006
    measurement date, Therefore, we maintained the discount rate for
    determining our fiscal 2008 pension and benefit costs at
    6.3 percent and the expected return on our pension plan
    assets at 8.25 percent. Accordingly, we expect our fiscal
    2008 pension and postretirement medical costs to be materially
    the same as fiscal 2007.

We are not required to make a minimum funding contribution to
    our pension plans during fiscal 2008; nor, at this time, do we
    intend to make voluntary contributions during 2008. However, we
    anticipate contributing approximately $12 million to our
    postretirement medical plans during fiscal 2008.

The projected pension liability, future funding requirements and
    the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the Plan
    are subject to change, depending upon the actuarial value of
    plan assets and the



determination of future benefit obligations as of each
    subsequent actuarial calculation date. These amounts are
    impacted by actual investment returns, changes in interest rates
    and changes in the demographic composition of the participants
    in the plan.

RECENT
    ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

Recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows are described in
    Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and
    interest rates. Commodity price risk is the potential loss that
    we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a
    particular instrument or commodity. Interest-rate risk results
    from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue
    to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities.

We conduct risk management activities through both our natural
    gas distribution and natural gas marketing segments. In our
    natural gas distribution segment, we use a combination of
    physical storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed financial
    contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually
    large winter period gas price increases. In our natural gas
    marketing segment, we manage our exposure to the risk of natural
    gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a
    combination of storage and financial derivatives including
    futures, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options and swap
    contracts with counterparties. Our risk management activities
    and related accounting treatment are described in further detail
    in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
    Additionally, our earnings are affected by changes in short-term
    interest rates as a result of our issuance of short-term
    commercial paper and our other short-term borrowings.

Commodity
    Price Risk

Natural
    gas distribution segment

We purchase natural gas for our natural gas distribution
    operations. Substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for
    natural gas distribution operations are recovered from our
    customers through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms. However,
    our natural gas distribution operations have commodity price
    risk exposure to fluctuations in spot natural gas prices related
    to purchases for sales to our nonregulated energy services
    customers at fixed prices.

For our natural gas distribution segment, we use a sensitivity
    analysis to estimate commodity price risk. For purposes of this
    analysis, we estimate commodity price risk by applying a
    hypothetical 10 percent increase in the portion of our gas
    costs related to fixed-price nonregulated sales. Based on these
    projected nonregulated gas sales, a hypothetical 10 percent
    increase in fixed prices based upon the September 30, 2007
    three month market strip, would increase our purchased gas cost
    by approximately $0.5 million in fiscal 2008.

Natural
    gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other
    segments

Our natural gas marketing segment is also exposed to risks
    associated with changes in the market price of natural gas. For
    our natural gas marketing segment, we use a sensitivity analysis
    to estimate commodity price risk. For purposes of this analysis,
    we estimate commodity price risk by applying a $0.50 change in
    the forward NYMEX price to our net open position (including
    existing storage and related financial contracts) at the end of
    each period. Based on AEH’s net open position (including
    existing storage and related financial contracts) at
    September 30, 2007 of 0.2 Bcf, a $0.50 change in the
    forward NYMEX price would have had a $0.1 million impact on
    our consolidated net income.

Changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to
    market our physical inventory (Gas Daily) and the related
    fair-value hedge (NYMEX) can result in volatility in our
    reported net income; but, over time, gains and losses on the
    sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses
    on the fair-value hedges. Based upon our net physical position
    at September 30, 2007 and assuming our hedges would still



qualify as highly effective, a $0.50 change in the difference
    between the Gas Daily and NYMEX indices would impact our
    reported net income by approximately $4.3 million.

Additionally, these changes could cause us to recognize a risk
    management liability, which would require us to place cash into
    an escrow account to collateralize this liability position.
    This, in turn, would reduce the amount of cash we would have on
    hand to fund our working capital needs.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our earnings are exposed to changes in short-term interest rates
    associated with our short-term commercial paper program and
    other short-term borrowings. We use a sensitivity analysis to
    estimate our short-term interest rate risk. For purposes of this
    analysis, we estimate our short-term interest rate risk as the
    difference between our actual interest expense for the period
    and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a
    hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates
    associated with our short-term borrowings. Had interest rates
    associated with our short-term borrowings increased by an
    average of one percent, our interest expense would have
    increased by approximately $2.7 million during 2007.

We also assess market risk for our fixed rate long-term
    obligations. We estimate market risk for our long-term
    obligations as the potential increase in fair value resulting
    from a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates
    associated with these debt instruments. Fair value is estimated
    using a discounted cash flow analysis. Assuming this one percent
    hypothetical decrease, the fair value of our long-term
    obligations would have increased by approximately
    $156.3 million.

As of September 30, 2007, we were not engaged in other
    activities that would cause exposure to the risk of material
    earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or
    market commodity prices.

REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board of Directors

Atmos Energy Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Atmos Energy Corporation as of September 30, 2007 and 2006,
    and the related consolidated statements of income,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended September 30, 2007. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    Index at Item 8. These financial statements and schedule
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Atmos Energy Corporation at
    September 30, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results
    of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
    in the period ended September 30, 2007, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our

Nature of
    Business

Atmos Energy Corporation (“Atmos” or “the
    Company”) and its subsidiaries are engaged primarily in the
    regulated natural gas distribution and transmission and storage
    businesses as well as certain other nonregulated businesses.
    Through our natural gas distribution business, we distribute
    natural gas through sales and transportation arrangements to
    approximately 3.2 million residential, commercial,
    public-authority and industrial customers through our six
    regulated natural gas distribution divisions, in the service
    areas described below:

Denotes locations where we have more limited service areas.

In addition, we transport natural gas for others through our
    distribution system. Our natural gas distribution business is
    subject to federal and state regulation

and/or

regulation by local authorities in each of the states in which
    the distribution divisions operate. Our corporate headquarters
    and shared-services function are located in Dallas, Texas, and
    our customer support centers are located in Amarillo and Waco,
    Texas.

Our regulated transmission and storage segment includes the
    regulated operations of our Atmos Pipeline — Texas
    Division, a division of the Company. The Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division transports natural gas to
    our Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division and to third parties, and
    manages five underground storage reservoirs in Texas.

Our nonregulated businesses operate in 22 states and
    include our natural gas marketing operations and our pipeline,
    storage and other operations. These businesses are operated
    through various wholly-owned subsidiaries of Atmos Energy
    Holdings, Inc. (AEH), which is wholly-owned by the Company based
    in Houston, Texas.

Our natural gas marketing operations are managed by Atmos Energy
    Marketing, LLC (AEM), which is wholly-owned by AEH. AEM provides
    a variety of natural gas management services to municipalities,
    natural gas utility systems and industrial natural gas
    customers, primarily in the southeastern and midwestern states
    and to our Colorado-Kansas, Kentucky/Mid-States and Louisiana
    divisions. These services consist primarily of furnishing
    natural gas supplies at fixed and market-based prices, contract
    negotiation and administration, load forecasting, gas storage
    acquisition and management services, transportation services,
    peaking sales and balancing services, capacity utilization
    strategies and gas price hedging through the use of derivative
    instruments.

Our pipeline, storage and other business includes the
    nonregulated operations of Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC
    (APS), Atmos Energy Services, LLC (AES) and Atmos Power Systems,
    Inc., which are wholly-owned by AEH. Through APS, we own or have
    an interest in underground storage fields in Kentucky and
    Louisiana. We also use these storage facilities to reduce the
    need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet
    customer demand during peak periods. Through December 31,
    2006, AES provided natural gas management services to our
    natural gas distribution operations, other than the Mid-Tex
    Division. These



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

services included aggregating and purchasing gas supply,
    arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately
    delivering the gas to our natural gas distribution service areas
    at competitive prices. Effective January 1, 2007, our
    shared services function began providing these services to our
    natural gas distribution operations. AES continues to provide
    limited services to our natural gas distribution divisions, and
    the revenues AES receives are equal to the costs incurred to
    provide those services. Through Atmos Power Systems, Inc., we
    have constructed electric peaking power-generating plants and
    associated facilities and lease these plants through lease
    agreements that are accounted for as sales under generally
    accepted accounting principles.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation

— The accompanying
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Atmos
    Energy Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
    material intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Use of estimates

— The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The most significant
    estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, legal and
    environmental accruals, insurance accruals, pension and
    postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes, asset
    retirement obligation, impairment of long-lived assets, risk
    management and trading activities and the valuation of goodwill,
    indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Regulation

— Our natural gas distribution and
    regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to
    regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of
    accounting records and various other matters by the respective
    regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. Our
    accounting policies recognize the financial effects of the
    ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various
    regulatory commissions. Regulated operations are accounted for
    in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 71,

Accounting for the Effects of Certain
    Types of Regulation

. This statement requires cost-based,
    rate-regulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect
    the authorized recovery of costs due to regulatory decisions in
    their financial statements. As a result, certain costs are
    permitted to be capitalized rather than expensed because they
    can be recovered through rates.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We record regulatory assets as a component of other current
    assets and deferred charges and other assets for costs that have
    been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates
    is considered probable. Regulatory liabilities are recorded
    either on the face of the balance sheet or as a component of
    current liabilities, deferred income taxes or deferred credits
    and other liabilities when it is probable that revenues will be
    reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through
    the ratemaking process. Significant regulatory assets and
    liabilities as of September 30, 2007 and 2006 included the
    following:

Currently authorized rates do not include a return on certain of
    our merger and integration costs; however, we recover the
    amortization of these costs. Merger and integration costs, net,
    are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated
    useful lives ranging up to 20 years. During the fiscal
    years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we
    recognized $0.3 million, $0.5 million and
    $2.3 million in amortization expense related to these costs.

Revenue recognition

— Sales of natural gas to
    our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly
    cycle basis; however, the billing cycle periods for certain
    classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting
    periods used for financial reporting purposes. We follow the
    revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas
    distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas
    delivered to customers, but not yet billed under the cycle
    billing method, are estimated and accrued and the related costs
    are charged to expense. Revenue is recognized in our regulated
    transmission and storage segment as the services are provided.

On occasion, we are permitted to implement new rates that have
    not been formally approved by our state regulatory commissions
    and are subject to refund. As permitted by
    SFAS No. 71, we recognize this revenue and establish a
    reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our
    experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were
    implemented.

Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for
    increases and decreases in our purchased gas cost through
    purchased gas adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas adjustment
    mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering
    purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate
    case to address all of the utility company’s non-gas costs.
    There is no gross profit generated through purchased gas



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

adjustments, but they provide a dollar-for-dollar offset to
    increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas costs.
    The effects of these purchased gas adjustment mechanisms are
    recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet.

Energy trading contracts resulting in the delivery of a
    commodity where we are the principal in the transaction are
    recorded as natural gas marketing sales or purchases at the time
    of physical delivery. Realized gains and losses from the
    settlement of financial instruments that do not result in
    physical delivery related to our natural gas marketing energy
    trading contracts and unrealized gains and losses from changes
    in the market value of open contracts are included as a
    component of natural gas marketing revenues. For the years ended
    September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we included unrealized
    gains (losses) on open contracts of $18.4 million,
    $17.2 million and ($26.0) million as a component of
    natural gas marketing revenues.

Operating revenues for our pipeline, storage and other segment
    are recognized in the period in which actual volumes are
    transported and storage services are provided.

Cash and cash equivalents

— We consider all
    highly liquid investments with an initial or remaining maturity
    of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Cash held on deposit in margin account

— Cash
    held on deposit in margin account consists of deposits made to
    collateralize certain financial derivatives purchased in support
    of our risk management activities. Under the terms of these
    derivative contracts, when the fair value of financial
    instruments held represents a net liability position, we are
    required to deposit cash into a margin account.

Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful
    accounts

— Accounts receivable consist of natural
    gas sales to residential, commercial, industrial, municipal,
    agricultural and other customers. For the majority of our
    receivables, we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts
    based on our collections experience. On certain other
    receivables where we are aware of a specific customer’s
    inability or reluctance to pay, we record an allowance for
    doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net
    receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to
    collect. However, if circumstances change, our estimate of the
    recoverability of accounts receivable could be different.
    Circumstances which could affect our estimates include, but are
    not limited to, customer credit issues, the level of natural gas
    prices, customer deposits and general economic conditions.
    Accounts are written off once they are deemed to be
    uncollectible.

Gas stored underground

— Our gas stored
    underground is comprised of natural gas injected into storage to
    support the winter season withdrawals for our natural gas
    distribution operations and natural gas held by our natural gas
    marketing and other nonregulated subsidiaries to conduct their
    operations. The average cost method is used for all our natural
    gas distribution divisions, except for certain jurisdictions in
    the Kentucky/Mid-States Division, where it is valued on the

first-in

first-out method basis, in accordance with regulatory
    requirements. The average gas cost method is also used for our
    regulated transmission and storage segment. Our natural gas
    marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments utilize the
    average cost method; however, most of this inventory is hedged
    and is therefore at fair value at the end of each month. Gas in
    storage that is retained as cushion gas to maintain reservoir
    pressure is classified as property, plant and equipment and is
    valued at cost.

Regulated property, plant and equipment

—
    Regulated property, plant and equipment is stated at original
    cost, net of contributions in aid of construction. The cost of
    additions includes direct construction costs, payroll related
    costs (taxes, pensions and other fringe benefits),
    administrative and general costs and an allowance for funds used
    during construction. The allowance for funds used during
    construction represents the estimated cost of funds used to
    finance the construction of major projects and are capitalized
    in the rate base for ratemaking purposes when the completed
    projects are placed in service. Interest expense of
    $3.0 million, $3.6 million and $2.5 million was
    capitalized in 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Major renewals, including replacement pipe, and betterments that
    are recoverable under our regulatory rate base are capitalized
    while the costs of maintenance and repairs that are not
    recoverable through rates are



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

charged to expense as incurred. The costs of large projects are
    accumulated in construction in progress until the project is
    completed. When the project is completed, tested and placed in
    service, the balance is transferred to the regulated plant in
    service account included in the rate base and depreciation
    begins.

Regulated property, plant and equipment is depreciated at
    various rates on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
    lives of the assets. These rates are approved by our regulatory
    commissions and are comprised of two components: one based on
    average service life and one based on cost of removal.
    Accordingly, we recognize our cost of removal expense as a
    component of depreciation expense. The related cost of removal
    accrual is reflected as a regulatory liability on the
    consolidated balance sheet. At the time property, plant and
    equipment is retired, removal expenses less salvage, are charged
    to the regulatory cost of removal accrual. The composite
    depreciation rate was 3.9 percent, 3.9 percent and
    4.0 percent for the years ended September 30, 2007,
    2006 and 2005.

Nonregulated property, plant and equipment

—
    Nonregulated property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.
    Depreciation is generally computed on the straight-line method
    for financial reporting purposes based upon estimated useful
    lives ranging from 3 to 42 years.

Asset retirement obligations

— SFAS 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

and
    FIN 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
    Obligations

require that we record a liability at fair value
    for an asset retirement obligation when the legal obligation to
    retire the asset has been incurred with an offsetting increase
    to the carrying value of the related asset. Accretion of the
    asset retirement obligation due to the passage of time is
    recorded as an operating expense.

As of September 30, 2007 and 2006, we had recorded asset
    retirement obligations of $9.0 million and
    $15.1 million. Additionally, we recorded $2.9 million
    and $4.8 million of asset retirement costs as a component
    of property, plant and equipment that will be depreciated over
    the remaining life of the underlying associated assets.

We believe we have a legal obligation to retire our storage
    wells. However, we have not recognized an asset retirement
    obligation associated with our storage wells because there is
    not sufficient industry history to reasonably estimate the fair
    value of this obligation.

Impairment of long-lived assets

— We
    periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have
    occurred that indicate that other long-lived assets may not be
    recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant
    revision. When such events or circumstances are present, we
    assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining
    whether the carrying value will be recovered through the
    expected future cash flows. In the event the sum of the expected
    future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less
    than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss equal
    to the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair
    value is recorded.

During fiscal 2007, we recorded a $6.3 million charge
    associated with the write-off of approximately $3.0 million
    of costs related to a nonregulated natural gas gathering project
    and approximately $3.3 million of obsolete software costs.
    During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we determined that, as
    a result of declining irrigation sales primarily associated with
    our agricultural customers’ shift from gas-powered pumps to
    electric pumps, the West Texas Division’s irrigation assets
    would not be able to generate sufficient future cash flows from
    operations to recover the net investment in these assets.
    Therefore, we recorded a $22.9 million charge to impairment
    to write off the entire net book value. We will continue to
    operate these irrigation assets until we determine a plan for
    these assets as we are obligated to provide natural gas services
    to certain customers served by these assets.

Goodwill and intangible assets

— We annually
    evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second
    fiscal quarter or more frequently as impairment indicators
    arise. We use a present value technique based on discounted cash
    flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. These
    calculations are



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of
    future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rate. An
    impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a
    reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value.

Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives of
    10 years. These assets are reviewed for impairment as
    impairment indicators arise. When such events or circumstances
    are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets
    by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered
    through the expected future cash flows. In the event the sum of
    the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the
    asset is less than the carrying value of the asset, an
    impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset’s carrying
    value over its fair value is recorded. To date, no impairment
    has been recognized.

Marketable securities

— As of
    September 30, 2007 and 2006, all of our marketable
    securities were classified as available-for-sale securities
    based upon the criteria of SFAS 115,

Accounting for
    Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

. In
    accordance with that standard, these securities are reported at
    market value with unrealized gains and losses shown as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We
    regularly evaluate the performance of these investments on a
    fund by fund basis for impairment, taking into consideration the
    fund’s purpose, volatility and current returns. If a
    determination is made that a decline in fair value is other than
    temporary, the related fund is written down to its estimated
    fair value.

Derivatives and hedging activities

— Our
    derivative and hedging activities are tailored to the segment to
    which they relate. We record our derivatives as a component of
    risk management assets and liabilities, which are classified as
    current or noncurrent other assets or liabilities based upon the
    anticipated settlement date of the underlying derivative.

The fair value of all of our financial derivatives is determined
    through a combination of prices actively quoted on national
    exchanges, prices provided by other external sources and prices
    based on models and other valuation methods. Changes in the
    valuation of our financial derivatives primarily result from
    changes in market prices, the valuation of the portfolio of our
    contracts, maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly
    originated transactions, each of which directly affect the
    estimated fair value of our derivatives. We believe the market
    prices and models used to value these derivatives represent the
    best information available with respect to closing exchange and
    over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility factors
    underlying the contracts. Values are adjusted to reflect the
    potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over
    a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions.

Natural
    Gas Distribution Segment

In our natural gas distribution segment, we use a combination of
    physical storage and financial derivatives to partially insulate
    our natural gas distribution customers against gas price
    volatility during the winter heating season. These financial
    derivatives have not been designated as hedges pursuant to
    SFAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities

. Accordingly, they are recorded at fair
    value. However, because the costs associated with and the gains
    and losses arising from these financial derivatives are included
    in our purchased gas adjustment mechanisms, changes in the fair
    value of these financial derivatives are initially recorded as a
    component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the
    consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas
    cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates in
    accordance with SFAS 71. Accordingly, there is no earnings
    impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a result of
    the use of financial derivatives.

Natural
    Gas Marketing Segment

Our natural gas marketing risk management activities are
    conducted through AEM. AEM is exposed to risks associated with
    changes in the market price of natural gas, and we manage our
    exposure to the risk of



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

natural gas price changes through a combination of physical
    storage and financial derivatives, including futures,
    over-the-counter and exchange-traded options and swap contracts
    with counterparties. Option contracts provide the right, but not
    the requirement, to buy or sell the commodity at a fixed price.
    Swap contracts require receipt of payment for the commodity
    based on the difference between a fixed price and the market
    price on the settlement date. The use of these contracts is
    subject to our risk management policies, which are monitored for
    compliance daily.

We participate in transactions in which we combine the natural
    gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs
    incurred to serve our customers. Additionally, we engage in
    natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and
    profit from pricing differences that occur over time. We
    purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial contracts
    at favorable prices to lock in gross profit margins. Through the
    use of transportation and storage services and derivatives, we
    are able to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of
    pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing
    pricing differences that occur over time. Over time, gains and
    losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by
    gains and losses on the derivatives, resulting in the
    realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated
    at the time we structured the original transaction.

We have designated the natural gas inventory held by our natural
    gas marketing segment as the hedged item in a fair-value hedge.
    This inventory is marked to market at the end of each month
    based on the Gas Daily index, with changes in fair value
    recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the
    period of change. The derivatives associated with this natural
    gas inventory have been designated as fair value hedges and are
    marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with
    changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses
    in the period of change. The difference in the spot price used
    to value our physical inventory (Gas Daily) and the forward
    price used to value the related fair-value hedges (NYMEX) are
    reported as a component of revenue and can result in volatility
    in our reported net income. We have elected to exclude this
    spot/forward differential for purposes of assessing the
    effectiveness of these fair-value hedges.

We recognize revenue and the associated carrying value of the
    inventory (inclusive of storage costs) as purchased gas cost in
    our consolidated statement of income when we sell the gas and
    deliver it out of the storage facility. Over time, we expect
    gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be
    offset by gains and losses on the fair-value hedges, resulting
    in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we
    anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction.

We have elected to treat our fixed-price forward contracts as
    normal purchases and sales and have designated the associated
    derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of anticipated
    transactions. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses on these
    open derivative contracts are recorded as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income, and are recognized in
    earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are
    sold. Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred, is reported
    as a component of revenue.

Additionally, our natural gas marketing segment utilizes storage
    swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage
    opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the
    original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural
    gas inventory, basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic
    value of our fixed price and storage books and various
    over-the-counter and exchange-traded options. Although the
    purpose of these instruments is to either reduce basis or other
    risks or lock in arbitrage opportunities, these derivative
    instruments have not been designated as hedges pursuant to
    SFAS 133. Accordingly, these derivative instruments are
    recorded at fair value with all changes in fair value included
    in revenue.

Gains and losses recognized in the income statement from hedge
    ineffectiveness primarily result from basis risk and from
    differences between the timing of the settlement of physical
    contracts and the settlement of the related hedge, that is
    referred to below as timing ineffectiveness. The following
    summarizes the gains and losses recognized in the income
    statement for the years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and
    2005.

Additionally, we have a policy which allows for the use of
    master netting agreements with significant counterparties that
    allow us to offset gains and losses arising from derivative
    instruments that may be settled in cash

and/or

gains
    and losses arising from derivative instruments that may be
    settled with the physical commodity. Assets and liabilities from
    risk management activities, as well as accounts receivable and
    payable, reflect the master netting agreements in place.

Pipeline,
    Storage and Other Segment

We have designated the natural gas inventory held by Atmos
    Pipeline and Storage, LLC as the hedged item in a fair-value
    hedge. This inventory is marked to market at the end of each
    month based on the Gas Daily index, with changes in fair value
    recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the
    period of change. The derivatives associated with this natural
    gas inventory have been designated as fair value hedges and are
    marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with
    changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses
    in the period of change. The difference in the spot price used
    to value our physical inventory (Gas Daily) and the forward
    price used to value the related fair-value hedges (NYMEX) are
    reported as a component of revenue and can result in volatility
    in our reported net income. We have elected to exclude this
    spot/forward differential for purposes of assessing the
    effectiveness of these fair-value hedges.

We recognize revenue and the associated carrying value of the
    inventory (inclusive of storage costs) as purchased gas cost in
    our consolidated statement of income when we sell the gas and
    deliver it out of the storage facility. Over time, we expect
    gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be
    offset by gains and losses on the fair-value hedges, resulting
    in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we
    anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction.

In our pipeline, storage and other segment, actual hedge
    ineffectiveness arising from the timing of settlement of
    physical contracts and the settlement of the derivative
    instruments resulted in a loss of approximately
    $0.5 million and $4.7 million for the years ended
    September 30, 2007 and 2006 and a gain of approximately
    $5.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2005.

Treasury
    Activities

In addition to mitigating commodity price risk, we periodically
    manage our exposure to interest rate changes by entering into
    Treasury lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of
    the interest cost associated with anticipated financings. We
    have designated our previously executed Treasury lock agreements
    as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction at the time
    the agreements were executed. Accordingly, unrealized gains and
    losses associated with the Treasury lock agreements are recorded
    as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The
    realized gain or loss recognized upon settlement of the

Treasury lock agreement is initially recorded as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income and is recognized as a
    component of interest expense over the life of the related
    financing arrangement.

Pension and other postretirement plans

—
    Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are
    determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous
    assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan
    assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed
    discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality
    data. We review the estimates and assumptions underlying our
    pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities
    annually based upon a June 30 measurement date. The assumed
    discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that
    generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs
    and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health
    care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally
    have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan
    costs and liabilities.

The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the
    actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement
    obligation and net pension and postretirement cost. When
    establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality
    corporate bond rates based on Moody’s Aa bond index,
    changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied
    discount rate that is derived from matching our projected
    benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate bond spot
    rate curve.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in
    calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the
    annual pension and postretirement plan cost. We estimate the
    expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond
    returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of
    active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset
    rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the
    guidance from our investment advisors in making final
    determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the
    extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the
    course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate,
    that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan cost is
    not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases
    future pension or postretirement plan cost over a period of
    approximately ten to twelve years.

We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in
    determining our postretirement net cost based upon our actual
    health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted
    legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of
    retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our
    participant census information as of the measurement date.

Income taxes

— Income taxes are provided based
    on the liability method, which results in income tax assets and
    liabilities arising from temporary differences. Temporary
    differences are differences between the tax bases of assets and
    liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial
    statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in
    future years. The liability method requires the effect of tax
    rate changes on current and accumulated deferred income taxes to
    be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted.
    The liability method also requires that deferred tax assets be
    reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than
    not that the assets will be realized.

Stock-based compensation plans

— We maintain
    the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan that provides for the granting
    of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock
    appreciation rights, bonus stock, time-lapse restricted stock,
    performance-based restricted stock units and stock units to
    officers, division presidents and other key employees.
    Non-employee directors are also eligible to receive stock-based
    compensation under the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The
    objectives of this plan include attracting and retaining the
    best personnel, providing for additional performance incentives
    and promoting our success by providing employees with the
    opportunity to acquire our common stock.

On October 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS 123 (revised),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123(R)) using the modified
    prospective method. We recorded a $0.4 million charge
    associated with the adoption, which was recorded as a component
    of operation and maintenance expense. In accordance with
    SFAS 123(R), we measure



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock
    options and similar awards based on the grant-date fair value of
    the award and recognize this cost in the income statement on a
    straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is
    required to provide service in exchange for the award.

Prior to October 1, 2005, we accounted for these plans
    under the intrinsic-value method described in APB Opinion 25, as
    permitted by SFAS 123. Under this method, no compensation
    cost for stock options was recognized for stock-option awards
    granted at or above fair-market value. Awards of restricted
    stock were valued at the market price of the Company’s
    common stock on the date of grant. The unearned compensation was
    amortized as a component of operation and maintenance expense
    over the vesting period of the restricted stock. Had
    compensation expense for our stock-based awards been recognized
    as prescribed by SFAS 123, our net income and earnings per
    share for the year ended September 30, 2005 would have been
    impacted as shown in the following table:

Recent accounting pronouncements

—  In February
    2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
    FASB Statement No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for
    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including
    an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115

. This new
    standard permits an entity to measure certain financial assets
    and financial liabilities at fair value. The objective of the
    standard is to improve financial reporting by allowing entities
    to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring
    related assets and liabilities differently without having to
    apply complex hedge accounting provisions. Entities that elect
    the fair value option will report unrealized gains and losses in
    earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value
    option may be elected on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis. The fair value option is irrevocable, unless a new
    election date occurs. The provisions of this standard will be
    effective October 1,

    Measurements

. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes
    a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures
    about fair value measurements required under other accounting
    pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to
    whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. We will
    be required to apply the provisions of SFAS 157 beginning
    October 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact
    this standard may have on our financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation
    of FASB Statement No. 109

(FIN 48). FIN 48
    clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by
    establishing standards for measurement and recognition in
    financial statements of positions taken by an entity in its
    income tax returns. This interpretation also provides guidance
    on removing income tax assets and liabilities from the balance
    sheet, classification of current and deferred income tax assets
    and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties,
    accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income tax
    disclosures. We will adopt the provisions of FIN 48
    beginning October 1, 2007. The adoption of this standard
    will not have a material impact on our financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

Acquisitions

In October 2004, we completed our acquisition of the natural gas
    distribution and pipeline operations of TXU Gas Company. The
    purchase price for the TXU Gas acquisition was approximately
    $1.9 billion (after closing adjustments and before
    transaction costs and expenses), which we paid in cash. We did
    not assume any indebtedness of TXU Gas in connection with the
    acquisition. The purchase was accounted for as an asset
    purchase. We funded the purchase price for the TXU Gas
    acquisition with approximately $235.7 million in net
    proceeds from our offering of approximately 9.9 million
    shares of common stock, which we completed in July 2004, and
    approximately $1.7 billion in net proceeds from our
    issuance in October 2004 of commercial paper backstopped by a
    senior unsecured revolving credit agreement, which we entered
    into in September 2004 to provide bridge financing for the TXU
    Gas acquisition. In October 2004, we paid off the outstanding
    commercial paper used to fund the acquisition through the
    issuance of senior unsecured notes in October 2004, which
    generated net proceeds of approximately $1.39 billion, and
    the sale of 16.1 million shares of common stock in October
    2004, which generated net proceeds of $381.6 million.

At closing of the acquisition, TXU Gas and some of its
    affiliates entered into transitional services agreements with us
    to provide call center, meter reading, customer billing,
    collections, information reporting, software, accounting,
    treasury, administrative and other services to the Mid-Tex
    Division. Some of these services were outsourced by TXU Gas to
    Capgemini Energy L.P. However, in November 2004, we entered into
    an agreement with Capgemini Energy L.P. whereby we assumed the
    operations of the Waco, Texas call center in April 2005 and
    purchased from Capgemini Energy L.P. all of the related call
    center assets in October 2005. The remaining transitional
    services agreements expired in September 2005 and were not
    renewed as we in-sourced all of these functions, effective
    October 2005.

Natural
    Gas Distribution Hedging Activities

We use a combination of physical storage, fixed physical
    contracts and fixed financial contracts to partially insulate us
    and our customers against gas price volatility during the winter
    heating season. For the

2006-2007

heating season, we hedged approximately 49 percent of our
    anticipated winter flowing gas requirements at a weighted
    average cost of approximately $8.56 per Mcf.

Our natural gas distribution hedging activities also includes
    the fair value of our treasury lock agreements which are
    described in further detail below.

Nonregulated
    Hedging Activities

For the year ended September 30, 2007, the change in the
    deferred hedging position in accumulated other comprehensive
    loss was attributable to decreases in future commodity prices
    relative to the commodity prices stipulated in the derivative
    contracts totaling $10.9 million and the recognition of
    $31.0 million in net deferred hedging losses in net income
    when the derivatives matured according to their terms. The net
    deferred hedging losses associated with open cash flow hedges
    remain subject to market price fluctuations until the positions
    are either settled under the terms of the hedge contracts or
    terminated prior to settlement. Substantially all of the
    deferred hedging loss as of September 30, 2007 is expected
    to be recognized in net income within the next fiscal year.

Under our risk management policies, we seek to match our
    financial derivative positions to our physical storage positions
    as well as our expected current and future sales and purchase
    obligations to maintain no open positions at the end of each
    trading day. The determination of our net open position as of
    any day, however, requires us to make assumptions as to future
    circumstances, including the use of gas by our customers in
    relation to our anticipated storage and market positions.
    Because the price risk associated with any net open position at
    the end of each day may increase if the assumptions are not
    realized, we review these assumptions as part of our daily
    monitoring activities. We can also be affected by intraday
    fluctuations of gas prices, since



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the price of natural gas purchased or sold for future delivery
    earlier in the day may not be hedged until later in the day. At
    times, limited net open positions related to our existing and
    anticipated commitments may occur. At the close of business on
    September 30, 2007, AEH had a net open position (including
    existing storage) of 0.2 Bcf.

Treasury
    Activities

In fiscal 2004, we entered into four Treasury lock agreements to
    fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost of
    financing associated with the-then anticipated issuance of
    $875 million of long-term debt issued in October 2004 in
    connection with the permanent financing for our TXU Gas
    acquisition. These Treasury lock agreements were settled in
    October 2004 with a net $43.8 million payment to the
    counterparties.

In March 2007, we entered into a Treasury lock agreement to fix
    the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated
    with $100 million of our $250 million
    6.35% Senior Notes issued in June 2007 (the Senior Notes
    Offering). This Treasury lock agreement was settled in June
    2007, and resulted in the receipt of $2.9 million from the
    counterparties.

Since we designated these Treasury lock agreements as cash flow
    hedges of an anticipated transaction, the gains and losses
    realized upon settlement were initially recorded as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive loss and are being recognized
    as a component of interest expense over the life of the
    associated notes from the date of settlement.

The following table presents our hedging transactions that were

In August 2004, we filed a registration statement with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under which we could
    issue, from time to time, up to $2.2 billion in new common
    stock

and/or

debt. In October 2004, we sold 16.1 million common shares
    under the registration statement, generating net proceeds of
    $382.5 million before other offering costs. Additionally,
    we issued senior unsecured debt under the



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

registration statement consisting of $1.4 billion in Senior
    Notes with due dates ranging from 2007 to 2034. The net proceeds
    from the sale of these senior notes were $1.39 billion.

The net proceeds from the October 2004 common stock and senior
    notes offerings, combined with the net proceeds from our July
    2004 offering were used to pay off $1.7 billion in
    outstanding commercial paper backstopped by a senior unsecured
    revolving credit agreement, which we entered into in September
    2004 for bridge financing for the TXU Gas acquisition. Also, as
    a result of this refinancing in October 2004, we canceled the
    senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

On December 4, 2006, we filed a registration statement with
    the SEC to issue, from time to time, up to $900 million in
    common stock

and/or

debt
    securities available for issuance, including approximately
    $401.5 million of capacity carried over from our prior
    shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2004.
    As discussed in Note 7, in December 2006, we sold
    approximately 6.3 million shares of common stock under the
    new registration statement.

On June 14, 2007, we closed a senior notes offering. The
    effective interest rate on these notes is 6.26 percent
    after giving effect to the $100 million Treasury lock
    discussed in Note 5. The net proceeds of approximately
    $247 million, together with $53 million of available
    cash, were used to repay our $300 million unsecured
    floating rate senior notes on July 15, 2007.

As of September 30, 2007, we had approximately
    $450 million of availability remaining under the
    registration statement. However, due to certain restrictions
    placed by one state regulatory commission on our ability to
    issue securities under the registration statement, we now have
    remaining and available for issuance a total of approximately
    $100 million of equity securities, $50 million of
    senior debt securities and $300 million of subordinated
    debt securities. In addition, due to restrictions imposed by
    another state regulatory commission, if the credit ratings on
    our senior unsecured debt were to fall below investment grade
    from either Standard & Poor’s Corporation (BBB-),
    Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. (Baa3) or Fitch Ratings,
    Ltd. (BBB-), our ability to issue any type of debt securities
    under the registration statement would be suspended until an
    investment grade rating from any of the three credit rating
    agencies was achieved.

Short-term
    debt

At September 30, 2007 and 2006, there was
    $150.6 million and $379.3 million outstanding under
    our commercial paper program. In addition, at September 30,
    2006, there was $3.1 million outstanding under our bank
    credit facilities. There were no amounts outstanding under our
    bank credit facilities at September 30, 2007. As of
    September 30, 2007, our commercial paper had maturities of
    less than three months, with interest rates ranging from
    5.75 percent to 6.00 percent.

Credit
    facilities

We maintain both committed and uncommitted credit facilities.
    Borrowings under our uncommitted credit facilities are made on a

when-and-as-needed

basis at the discretion of the bank. Our credit capacity and the
    amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal
    nature of the natural gas business and our short-term borrowing
    requirements, which are typically highest during colder winter
    months. Our working capital needs can vary significantly due to
    changes in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the
    increased gas supplies required to meet customers’ needs
    during periods of cold weather.

Committed
    credit facilities

As of September 30, 2007, we had three short-term committed
    revolving credit facilities totaling $918 million. The
    first facility is a five-year unsecured facility, expiring
    December 2011, for $600 million that bears interest at a
    base rate or at the LIBOR rate for the applicable interest
    period, plus from 0.30 percent to 0.75 percent, based
    on the Company’s credit ratings, and serves as a backup
    liquidity facility for our



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$600 million commercial paper program. At
    September 30, 2007, there was $150.6 million
    outstanding under our commercial paper program.

We have a second unsecured facility in place which is a

364-day

facility for $300 million that bears interest at a base
    rate or the LIBOR rate for the applicable interest period, plus
    from 0.30 percent to 0.75 percent, based on the
    Company’s credit ratings. This facility was replaced by
    another

364-day

facility in November 2007 with no material changes to its terms
    and pricing. At September 30, 2007, there were no
    borrowings under this facility.

We have a third unsecured facility in place for $18 million
    that bears interest at the Federal Funds rate plus
    0.5 percent. This facility expired in March 2007 and was
    renewed for one year with no material changes to its terms and
    pricing. At September 30, 2007, there were no borrowings
    outstanding under this facility.

The availability of funds under our credit facilities is subject
    to conditions specified in the respective credit agreements, all
    of which we currently satisfy. These conditions include our
    compliance with financial covenants and the continued accuracy
    of representations and warranties contained in these agreements.
    We are required by the financial covenants in our revolving
    credit facilities to maintain, at the end of each fiscal
    quarter, a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no
    greater than 70 percent. At September 30, 2007, our
    total-debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, as defined, was
    56 percent. In addition, both the interest margin over the
    Eurodollar rate and the fee that we pay on unused amounts under
    our revolving credit facilities are subject to adjustment
    depending upon our credit ratings. The revolving credit
    facilities each contain the same limitation with respect to our
    total-debt to-total capitalization ratio.

Uncommitted
    credit facilities

AEM has a $580 million uncommitted demand working capital
    credit facility. On March 30, 2007, AEM and the banks in
    the facility amended the facility, primarily to extend it to
    March 31, 2008. Borrowings under the credit facility can be
    made either as revolving loans or offshore rate loans. Revolving
    loan borrowings will bear interest at a floating rate equal to a
    base rate defined as the higher of (i) 0.50 percent
    per annum above the Federal Funds rate or (ii) the
    lender’s prime rate plus 0.25 percent. Offshore rate
    loan borrowings will bear interest at a floating rate equal to a
    base rate based upon LIBOR for the applicable interest period
    plus an applicable margin, ranging from 1.25 percent to
    1.625 percent per annum, depending on the excess tangible
    net worth of AEM, as defined in the credit facility. Borrowings
    drawn down under letters of credit issued by the banks will bear
    interest at a floating rate equal to the base rate, as defined
    above, plus an applicable margin, which will range from
    1.00 percent to 1.875 percent per annum, depending on
    the excess tangible net worth of AEM and whether the letters of
    credit are swap-related standby letters of credit.

AEM is required by the financial covenants in the credit
    facility to maintain a maximum ratio of total liabilities to
    tangible net worth of 5 to 1, along with minimum levels of net
    working capital ranging from $20 million to
    $120 million. Additionally, AEM must maintain a minimum
    tangible net worth ranging from $21 million to
    $121 million, and must not have a maximum cumulative loss
    from for the most recent 12 month accounting period
    exceeding $4 million to $23 million, depending on the
    total amount of borrowing elected from time to time by AEM. At
    September 30, 2007, AEM’s ratio of total liabilities
    to tangible net worth, as defined, was 1.29 to 1.

At September 30, 2007, there were no borrowings outstanding
    under this credit facility. However, at September 30, 2007,
    AEM letters of credit totaling $78.2 million had been
    issued under the facility, which reduced the amount available by
    a corresponding amount. The amount available under this credit
    facility is also limited by various covenants, including
    covenants based on working capital. Under the most restrictive
    covenant, the amount available to AEM under this credit facility
    was $121.8 million at September 30, 2007. This line of
    credit is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of
    AEM and is guaranteed by AEH.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We also have an unsecured short-term uncommitted credit line for
    $25 million that is used for working capital and
    letter-of-credit purposes. There were no borrowings under this
    uncommitted credit facility at September 30, 2007, but
    letters of credit reduced the amount available by
    $5.4 million. This uncommitted line is renewed or
    renegotiated at least annually with varying terms, and we pay no
    fee for the availability of the line. Borrowings under this line
    are made on a

when-and-as-available

basis at the discretion of the bank.

AEH, the parent company of AEM, has an intercompany uncommitted
    demand credit facility with the Company which bears interest at
    the rate of AEM’s $580 million uncommitted demand
    working capital credit facility plus 0.25 percent.
    Effective May 1, 2007, the intercompany credit facility was
    increased from $100 million to $200 million.
    Applicable state regulatory commissions have approved this
    facility through December 31, 2008. At September 30,
    2007, there were no borrowings under this facility.

In June 2007, the Company entered into a $200 million
    intercompany uncommitted revolving credit facility and
    promissory note with AEH. The new facility bears interest at the
    lesser of (i) LIBOR plus 0.20 percent or (ii) the
    marginal borrowing rate available to the Company on any such
    date under its commercial paper program. Applicable state
    regulatory commissions have approved this facility through
    December 31, 2008. At September 30, 2007, there was
    $36.7 million outstanding under this facility.

In addition, to supplement its $580 million credit
    facility, AEM has an intercompany uncommitted demand credit
    facility with AEH, which bears interest at LIBOR plus
    2.75 percent. Effective May 1, 2007, this intercompany
    credit facility was increased from $120 million to
    $175 million. Any outstanding amounts under this facility
    are subordinated to AEM’s $580 million uncommitted
    demand credit facility. At September 30, 2007, there was
    $30.0 million outstanding under this facility.

Debt
    Covenants

We have other covenants in addition to those described above.
    Our Series P First Mortgage Bonds contain provisions that
    allow us to prepay the outstanding balance in whole at any time,
    after November 2007, subject to a prepayment premium. The First
    Mortgage Bonds provide for certain cash flow requirements and
    restrictions on additional indebtedness, sale of assets and
    payment of dividends. Under the most restrictive of such
    covenants, cumulative cash dividends paid after
    December 31, 1985 may not exceed the sum of
    accumulated net income for periods after December 31, 1985
    plus $9.0 million. At September 30, 2007 approximately
    $260.2 million of retained earnings was unrestricted with
    respect to the payment of dividends.

As of September 30, 2007, a portion of the
    Kentucky/Mid-States Division utility plant assets, totaling
    $413.4 million, was subject to a lien under the Indenture
    of Mortgage of the Series P First Mortgage Bonds.

We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of
    September 30, 2007. If we do not comply with our debt
    covenants, we may be required to repay our outstanding balances
    on demand, provide additional collateral or take other
    corrective actions. Our public debt indentures relating to our
    senior notes and debentures, as well as our revolving credit
    agreements, each contain a default provision that is triggered
    if outstanding indebtedness arising out of any other credit
    agreements in amounts ranging from in excess of $15 million
    to in excess of $100 million becomes due by acceleration or
    is not paid at maturity. In addition, AEM’s credit
    agreement contains a cross-default provision whereby AEM would
    be in default if it defaults on other indebtedness, as defined,
    by at least $250 thousand in the aggregate. Additionally, this
    agreement contains a provision that would limit the amount of
    credit available if the Company was downgraded below an S&P
    rating of BBB and a Moody’s rating of Baa2.

Except as described above, we have no triggering events in our
    debt instruments that are tied to changes in specified credit
    ratings or stock price, nor have we entered into any
    transactions that would require us to issue equity based on our
    credit rating or other triggering events.

Shareholders’
    Equity

Stock
    Issuances

During the years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 we
    issued 7,587,021, 1,200,115 and 17,739,691 shares of common
    stock.

On December 13, 2006, we completed the public offering of
    6,325,000 shares of our common stock including the
    underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option of
    825,000 shares. The offering was priced at $31.50 per share
    and generated net proceeds of approximately $192 million.
    We used the net proceeds from this offering to reduce short-term
    debt.

Shareholder
    Rights Plan

In November 1997, our Board of Directors declared a dividend
    distribution of one right for each outstanding share of our
    common stock to shareholders of record at the close of business
    on May 10, 1998. Each right entitles the registered holder
    to purchase from us a one-tenth share of our common stock at a
    purchase price of $8.00 per share, subject to adjustment. The
    description and terms of the rights are set forth in a rights
    agreement between us and the rights agent.

Subject to exceptions specified in the rights agreement, the
    rights will separate from our common stock and a distribution
    date will occur upon the earlier of:

•

ten business days following a public announcement that a person
    or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired, or
    obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of
    15 percent or more of the outstanding shares of our common
    stock, other than as a result of repurchases of stock by us or
    specified inadvertent actions by institutional or other
    shareholders;

•

ten business days, or such later date as our Board of Directors
    shall determine, following the commencement of a tender offer or
    exchange offer that would result in a person or group having
    acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership
    of 15 percent or more of the outstanding shares of our
    common stock; or

•

ten business days after our Board of Directors shall declare any
    person to be an adverse person within the meaning of the rights
    plan.

The rights expire on May 10, 2008, unless extended prior
    thereto by our board of directors or earlier if redeemed by us.
    The rights will not have any voting rights. The exercise price
    payable and the number of shares of our common stock or other
    securities or property issuable upon exercise of the rights are
    subject to



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution. We issue
    rights when we issue our common stock until the rights have
    separated from the common stock. After the rights have separated
    from the common stock, we may issue additional rights if the
    board of directors deems such issuance to be necessary or
    appropriate. The rights have “anti-takeover” effects
    and may cause substantial dilution to a person or entity that
    attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of
    directors except pursuant to an offer conditioned upon a
    substantial number of rights being acquired. The rights should
    not interfere with any merger or other business combination
    approved by our board of directors because, prior to the time
    that the rights become exercisable or transferable, we can
    redeem the rights at $.01 per right.

Other
    Agreements

In connection with our Mississippi Valley Gas Company
    acquisition in December 2002, we issued shares of common stock
    under an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of
    1933, as amended. In the transaction, we entered into a
    registration rights agreement with the former stockholders of
    Mississippi Valley Gas Company that required us, on no more than
    two occasions, and with some limitations, to file a registration
    statement under the Securities Act within 60 days of their
    request for an offering designed to achieve a wide distribution
    of shares through underwriters selected by us. We also granted
    rights to these shareholders, subject to some limitations, to
    participate in future registered offerings of our securities
    until December 3, 2005. No registration rights issued to
    the former stockholders of MVG, as discussed above, were
    exercised prior to the expiration of the registration rights
    agreement on December 3, 2005. The former stockholders of
    MVG also agreed, for up to five years from the closing of the
    acquisition, or until December 3, 2007, and with some
    exceptions, not to sell or transfer shares representing more
    than 1 percent of our total outstanding voting securities
    to any person or group or any shares to a person or group who
    would hold more than 9.9 percent of our total outstanding
    voting securities after the sale or transfer. This restriction,
    and other agreed restrictions on the ability of these
    shareholders to acquire additional shares, participate in proxy
    solicitations or act to seek control, may be deemed to have an
    “anti-takeover” effect.

Stock and
    Other Compensation Plans

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

Total stock-based compensation expense was $11.9 million,
    $10.2 million and $3.9 million for the years ended
    September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, primarily related to
    restricted stock costs.

    Long-Term Incentive Plan

In August 1998, the Board of Directors approved and adopted the
    1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which became effective in
    October 1998 after approval by our shareholders. The LTIP is a
    comprehensive, long-term incentive compensation plan providing
    for discretionary awards of incentive stock options,
    non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, bonus
    stock, time-lapse restricted stock, performance-based restricted
    stock units and stock units to certain employees and
    non-employee directors of the Company and our subsidiaries. The
    objectives of this plan include attracting and retaining the
    best personnel, providing for additional performance incentives
    and promoting our success by providing employees with the
    opportunity to acquire common stock. We are authorized to grant
    awards for up to a maximum of 6.5 million shares of common
    stock under this plan subject to certain adjustment provisions.
    As of September 30, 2007, non-qualified stock options,
    bonus stock, time-lapse restricted stock, performance-based
    restricted stock units and stock units had been issued under
    this plan, and 2,730,192 shares were available for future
    issuance. The option price of the stock options issued under
    this plan is equal to the market price of our stock at the date
    of grant. These stock options expire 10 years from the date
    of the grant and vest annually over a service period ranging
    from one to three years.

Restricted
    Stock Plans

As noted above, the LTIP provides for discretionary awards of
    restricted stock to help attract, retain and reward employees
    and non-employee directors of Atmos and its subsidiaries.
    Certain of these awards vest based upon the passage of time and
    other awards vest based upon the passage of time and the
    achievement of specified performance targets. The associated
    expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. The

Other
    Plans

Direct
    Stock Purchase Plan

We maintain a Direct Stock Purchase Plan, open to all investors,
    which allows participants to have all or part of their cash
    dividends paid quarterly in additional shares of our common
    stock. The minimum initial investment required to join the plan
    is $1,250. Direct Stock Purchase Plan participants may purchase
    additional shares of our common stock as often as weekly with
    voluntary cash payments of at least $25, up to an annual maximum
    of $100,000.

Outside
    Directors Stock-For-Fee Plan

In November 1994, the Board adopted the Outside Directors
    Stock-for-Fee Plan which was approved by our shareholders in
    February 1995 and was amended and restated in November 1997. The
    plan permits non-employee directors to receive all or part of
    their annual retainer and meeting fees in stock rather than in
    cash.

Equity
    Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
    Directors

In November 1998, the Board of Directors adopted the Equity
    Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
    Directors which was approved by our shareholders in February
    1999. This plan amended the Atmos Energy Corporation Deferred
    Compensation Plan for Outside Directors adopted by the Company
    in May 1990 and replaced the pension payable under our
    Retirement Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The plan provides
    non-employee directors of Atmos with the opportunity to defer
    receipt, until retirement, of compensation for services rendered
    to the Company, invest deferred compensation into either a cash
    account or a stock account and to receive an annual grant of
    share units for each year of service on the Board.

Other
    Discretionary Compensation Plans

We created the Variable Pay Plan in fiscal 1999 for our
    regulated segments’ employees to give each employee an
    opportunity to share in our financial success based on the
    achievement of key performance measures considered critical to
    achieving business objectives for a given year. These
    performance measures may include earnings growth objectives,
    improved cash flow objectives or crucial customer satisfaction
    and safety results. We monitor progress towards the achievement
    of the performance measures throughout the year and record
    accruals based upon the expected payout using the best estimates
    available at the time the accrual is recorded.

We implemented our Annual Incentive Plan in October 2001 to give
    the employees in our nonregulated segments an opportunity to
    share in the success of the nonregulated operations. The plan is
    based upon the net earnings of the nonregulated operations and
    has minimum and maximum thresholds. The plan must meet the
    minimum threshold in order for the plan to be funded and
    distributed to employees. We monitor the progress toward the
    achievement of the thresholds throughout the year and record
    accruals based upon the expected payout using the best estimates
    available at the time the accrual is recorded.

Retirement
    and Post-Retirement Employee Benefit Plans

We have both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit
    plans that together cover substantially all of our employees. We
    also maintain post-retirement plans that provide health care
    benefits to retired employees. Finally, we sponsor defined
    contribution plans which cover substantially all employees.
    These plans are discussed in further detail below.

Effective September 30, 2007, we adopted the provisions of
    SFAS 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
    Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

. The new
    standard makes a significant change to the existing rules by
    requiring recognition in the

balance sheet of the overfunded or underfunded positions of
    defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, along
    with a corresponding noncash, after-tax adjustment to
    stockholders’ equity. Additionally, this standard requires
    that the measurement date must correspond to the fiscal year end
    balance sheet date. However the measurement date provision of
    this standard may be adopted as late as fiscal 2009 for the
    Company. This standard does not change how net periodic pension
    and postretirement cost or the projected benefit obligation is
    determined.

The incremental effect of applying SFAS 158 on individual
    line items in our balance as of September 30, 2007 is as

    Benefit Plans

Employee
    Pension Plans

As of September 30, 2007, we maintained two defined benefit
    plans: the Atmos Energy Corporation Pension Account Plan (the
    Plan) and the Atmos Energy Corporation Retirement Plan for
    Mississippi Valley Gas Union Employees (the Union Plan)
    (collectively referred to as the Plans). The Plans are held
    within the Atmos Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust (the
    Master Trust).

The Plan is a cash balance pension plan, that was established
    effective January 1999 and covers substantially all employees of
    Atmos. Opening account balances were established for
    participants as of January 1999 equal to the present value of
    their respective accrued benefits under the pension plans which
    were previously in effect as of December 31, 1998. The Plan
    credits an allocation to each participant’s account at the
    end of each year according to a formula based on the
    participant’s age, service and total pay (excluding
    incentive pay).

The Plan also provides for an additional annual allocation based
    upon a participant’s age as of January 1, 1999 for
    those participants who were participants in the prior pension
    plans. The Plan will credit this additional allocation each year
    through December 31, 2008. In addition, at the end of each
    year, a participant’s



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

account will be credited with interest on the employee’s
    prior year account balance. A special grandfather benefit also
    applies through December 31, 2008, for participants who
    were at least age 50 as of January 1, 1999, and who
    were participants in one of the prior plans on December 31,
    1998. Participants fully vest in their account balances after
    five years of service and may choose to receive their account
    balances as a lump sum or an annuity.

The Union Plan is a defined benefit plan that covers
    substantially all full-time union employees in our Mississippi
    Division. Under this plan, benefits are based upon years of
    benefit service and average final earnings. Participants vest in
    the plan after five years and will receive their benefit in an
    annuity.

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an
    amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. However, additional
    voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered
    necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for
    benefits attributed to service to date but also for those
    expected to be earned in the future.

During fiscal 2007, we were not required to make a minimum
    funding contribution and we made no other contributions to the
    Plans. During fiscal 2006, we voluntarily contributed
    $2.9 million to the Union Plan. That contribution achieved
    a desired level of funding by satisfying the minimum funding
    requirements while maximizing the tax deductible contribution
    for this plan for plan year 2005. During fiscal 2005, we
    voluntarily contributed $3.0 million to the Master Trust to
    maintain the level of funding we desire relative to our
    accumulated benefit obligation. We made the contribution because
    declining high yield corporate bond yields in the period leading
    up to our June 30, 2005 measurement date resulted in an
    increase in the present value of our plan liabilities. We are
    not required to make a minimum funding contribution during
    fiscal 2008 nor do we anticipate making any voluntary
    contributions during fiscal 2008.

We manage the Master Trust’s assets with the objective of
    achieving a rate of return net of inflation of approximately
    four percent per year. We make investment decisions and evaluate
    performance on a medium term horizon of at least three to five
    years. We also consider our current financial status when making
    recommendations and decisions regarding the Master Trust’s
    assets. Finally, we strive to ensure the Master Trust’s
    assets are appropriately invested to maintain an acceptable
    level of risk and meet the Master Trust’s long-term asset
    allocation policy.

To achieve these objectives, we invest the Master Trust’s
    assets in equity securities, fixed income securities, interests
    in commingled pension trust funds, other investment assets and
    cash and cash equivalents. Investments in equity securities are
    diversified among the market’s various subsectors in an
    effort to diversify risk and maximize returns. Fixed income
    securities are invested in investment grade securities. Cash
    equivalents are invested in securities that either are short
    term (less than 180 days) or readily convertible to cash
    with modest risk.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At September 30, 2007 and 2006, the Plan held
    1,169,700 shares of our common stock, which represented
    8.5 percent and 9.2 percent of total Master Trust
    assets. These shares generated dividend income for the Plan of
    approximately $1.5 million during fiscal 2007 and 2006.

Our employee pension plan expenses and liabilities are
    determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous
    assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan
    assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets and
    assumed discount rates and demographic data. We review the
    estimates and assumptions underlying our employee pension plans
    annually based upon a June 30 measurement date. The development
    of our assumptions is fully described in our significant
    accounting policies in Note 2. The actuarial assumptions
    used to determine the pension liability for the Plans were
    determined as of June 30, 2007 and 2006 and the actuarial
    assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension cost for
    the Plans were determined as of June 30, 2006, 2005 and

Supplemental
    Executive Benefits Plans

We have a nonqualified Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan
    which provides additional pension, disability and death benefits
    to our officers, division presidents and certain other employees
    of the Company who were employed on or before August 12,
    1998. In addition, in August 1998, we adopted the Supplemental
    Executive Retirement Plan which covers all employees who become
    officers or division presidents after August 12, 1998 or
    any other employees selected by our Board of Directors at its
    discretion.

Similar to our employee pension plans, we review the estimates
    and assumptions underlying our supplemental executive benefit
    plans annually based upon a June 30 measurement date using the
    same techniques as our employee pension plans. The actuarial
    assumptions used to determine the pension liability for the
    supplemental plans were determined as of June 30, 2007 and
    2006 and the actuarial assumptions used to determine the net
    periodic pension cost for the supplemental plans were determined

Postretirement
    Benefits

At September 30, 2007, we sponsored the Retiree Medical
    Plan for Retirees and Disabled Employees of Atmos Energy
    Corporation (the Atmos Retiree Medical Plan). This plan provides
    medical and prescription drug protection to all qualified
    participants based on their date of retirement. The Atmos
    Retiree Medical Plan provides different levels of benefits
    depending on the level of coverage chosen by the participants
    and the terms of predecessor plans; however, we generally pay
    80 percent of the projected net claims and administrative
    costs and participants pay the remaining 20 percent of this
    cost.

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an
    amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. However, additional
    voluntary contributions are made annually as considered
    necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for
    benefits attributed to service to date but also for those
    expected to be earned in the future. We expect to contribute
    $12.0 million to our postretirement benefits plan during
    fiscal 2008.

We maintain a formal investment policy with respect to the
    assets in our postretirement benefits plan to ensure the assets
    funding the postretirement benefit plan are appropriately
    invested to maintain an acceptable level of risk. We also
    consider our current financial status when making
    recommendations and decisions regarding the postretirement
    benefits plan.

We currently invest the assets funding our postretirement
    benefit plan in money market funds, equity mutual funds, fixed
    income funds and a balanced fund. The following table presents
    asset allocation information for the postretirement benefit plan
    assets as of September 30, 2007 and 2006.

Defined
    Contribution Plans

As of September 30, 2007, we maintained three defined
    contribution benefit plans: the Atmos Energy Corporation
    Retirement Savings Plan and Trust (the Retirement Savings Plan),
    the Atmos Energy Corporation Savings Plan for MVG Union
    Employees (the Union 401K Plan) and the Atmos Energy Marketing,
    LLC 401K Profit-Sharing Plan (the AEM 401K Profit-Sharing Plan).

The Retirement Savings Plan covers substantially all regulated
    employees and is subject to the provisions of
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participants
    may elect a salary reduction ranging from a minimum of one
    percent up to a maximum of 65 percent of eligible
    compensation, as defined by the Plan, not to exceed the maximum
    allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. We match
    100 percent of a participant’s contributions, limited
    to four percent of the participant’s salary, in our common
    stock. However, participants have the option to immediately
    transfer this matching contribution into other funds held within
    the plan. Participants are eligible to receive matching
    contributions after completing one year of service. Participants
    are also permitted to take out loans against their accounts
    subject to certain restrictions.

The Union 401K Plan covers substantially all Mississippi
    Division employees who are members of the International Chemical
    Workers Union Council, United Food and Commercial Workers Union
    International (the Union) and is subject to the provisions
    of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees
    of the Union automatically become participants of the Union 401K
    plan on the date of union employment. We match 50 percent
    of a participant’s contribution, limited to six percent of
    the participant’s eligible contribution. Participants are
    also permitted to take out loans against their accounts subject
    to certain restrictions.

Matching contributions to the Retirement Savings Plan and the
    Union 401K Plan are expensed as incurred and amounted to
    $8.3 million, $7.0 million, and $5.7 million for
    2007, 2006 and 2005. The Board of Directors may also approve
    discretionary contributions, subject to the provisions of the
    Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and applicable regulations of the
    Internal Revenue Service. No discretionary contributions were
    made for 2007, 2006 or 2005. At September 30, 2007 and
    2006, the Retirement Savings Plan held 3.1 percent and
    3.2 percent of our outstanding common stock.

The AEM 401K Profit-Sharing Plan covers substantially all AEM
    employees and is subject to the provisions of
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participants
    may elect a salary reduction ranging from a minimum of one
    percent up to a maximum of 65 percent of eligible
    compensation, as defined by the Plan, not to exceed the maximum
    allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company may elect
    to make safe harbor contributions up to 3 percent of the
    employee’s salary which vest immediately. The Company may
    also make discretionary profit sharing contributions to the AEM
    401K Profit-Sharing Plan. Participants become fully vested in
    the discretionary profit-sharing contributions after three years
    of service. Participants are also permitted to take out loans
    against their accounts subject to certain restrictions.
    Discretionary contributions to the AEM 401K Profit-Sharing Plan
    are expensed as incurred and amounted to $0.8 million,
    $0.8 million and $0.6 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005.

We have tax carryforwards related to state net operating losses
    amounting to $2.5 million. Depending on the jurisdiction in
    which the net operating loss was generated, the state net
    operating losses will begin to expire between 2012 and 2027.

The Internal Revenue Service is currently conducting a routine
    examination of our fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004 tax returns. We
    believe all material tax items which relate to the years under
    audit have been properly accrued.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Litigation

Colorado-Kansas
    Division

We are a defendant in a lawsuit originally filed by Quinque
    Operating Company, Tom Boles and Robert Ditto in September 1999
    in the District Court of Stevens County, Kansas against more
    than 200 companies in the natural gas industry. The
    plaintiffs, who purport to represent a class of royalty owners,
    allege that the defendants have underpaid royalties on gas taken
    from wells situated on non-federal and non-Indian lands in
    Kansas, predicated upon allegations that the defendants’
    gas measurements were inaccurate. The plaintiffs have not
    specifically alleged an amount of damages. We are also a
    defendant, along with over 50 other companies in the natural gas
    industry, in another proposed class action lawsuit filed in the
    same court by Will Price, Tom Boles and The Cooper Clarke
    Foundation in May 2003 involving similar allegations. We believe
    that the plaintiffs’ claims are lacking in merit and we
    intend to vigorously defend these actions. While the results
    cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the final outcome
    of such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We
    were also a defendant in another lawsuit entitled

In Re
    Natural Gas Royalties Qui Tam Litigation

, involving similar
    allegations filed in June 1997 in the United States District
    Court for the District of Colorado, which was later transferred
    to the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming,
    where it was consolidated with approximately 50 additional
    lawsuits in October 1999. In October 2006, the District Court
    granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss this lawsuit for
    lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The plaintiffs have
    appealed this dismissal order, which has yet to be ruled on by
    the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.

We are a party to other litigation and claims that have arisen
    in the ordinary course of our business. While the results of
    such litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty,
    we believe the final outcome of such litigation and claims will
    not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flows.

Environmental
    Matters

Former
    Manufactured Gas Plant Sites

We are the owner or previous owner of former manufactured gas
    plant sites in Johnson City and Bristol, Tennessee, Keokuk,
    Iowa, and Hannibal, Missouri, which were used to supply gas
    prior to the availability of natural gas. The gas manufacturing
    process resulted in certain byproducts and residual materials,
    including coal tar. The manufacturing process used by our
    predecessors was an acceptable and satisfactory process at the
    time such operations were being conducted.

Under current environmental protection laws and regulations, we
    may be responsible for response actions with respect to such
    materials if response actions are necessary. We have taken
    removal actions with respect to the sites that have been
    approved by the applicable regulatory authorities in Tennessee,
    Iowa and Missouri.

We are a party to other environmental matters and claims that
    have arisen in the ordinary course of our business. While the
    ultimate results of response actions to these environmental
    matters and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we
    believe the final outcome of such response actions will not have
    a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations or cash flows because we believe that the



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

expenditures related to such response actions will either be
    recovered through rates, shared with other parties or are
    adequately covered by insurance.

Purchase
    Commitments

AEM has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural
    gas under contracts indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed
    price contracts. At September 30, 2007, AEM was committed
    to purchase 80.4 Bcf within one year, 38.1 Bcf within
    one to three years and 1.4 Bcf after three years under
    indexed contracts. AEM is committed to purchase 2.4 Bcf
    within one year and 0.1 Bcf within one to three years under
    fixed price contracts with prices ranging from $5.69 to $9.85
    per Mcf. Purchases under these contracts totaled
    $2,065.1 million, $2,124.3 million and
    $1,421.2 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Our natural gas distribution divisions, except for our Mid-Tex
    Division, maintain supply contracts with several vendors that
    generally cover a period of up to one year. Commitments for
    estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts
    on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices.
    Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as
    necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the
    individual contract.

Our Mid-Tex Division maintains long-term supply contracts to
    ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service
    area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market
    prices. The estimated commitments under these contracts as of
    September 30, 2007 are as follows (in thousands):

We have entered into non-cancelable operating leases for office
    and warehouse space used in our operations. The remaining lease
    terms range from one to 20 years and generally provide for
    the payment of taxes, insurance and maintenance by the lessee.
    Renewal options exist for certain of these leases. We have also
    entered into capital leases for division offices and operating
    facilities. Property, plant and equipment included amounts for
    capital leases of $4.6 million and $5.8 million at
    September 30, 2007 and 2006. Accumulated depreciation for
    these capital leases totaled $3.2 million and

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to us if a customer
    fails to perform its contractual obligations. We engage in
    transactions for the purchase and sale of products and services
    with major companies in the energy industry and with industrial,
    commercial, residential and municipal energy consumers. These
    transactions principally occur in the southern and midwestern
    regions of the United States. We believe that this geographic
    concentration does not contribute significantly to our overall
    exposure to credit risk. Credit risk associated with trade
    accounts receivable for the natural gas distribution segment is
    mitigated by the large number of individual customers and
    diversity in our customer base. The credit risk for our other
    segments is not significant.

Customer diversification also helps mitigate AEM’s exposure
    to credit risk. AEM maintains credit policies with respect to
    its counterparties that it believes minimizes overall credit
    risk. Where appropriate, such policies include the evaluation of
    a prospective counterparty’s financial condition,
    collateral requirements and the use of standardized agreements
    that facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a
    single counterparty. AEM also monitors the financial condition
    of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis. Customers not
    meeting minimum standards are required to provide adequate
    assurance of financial performance.

AEM maintains a provision for credit losses based upon factors
    surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends and
    other information. We believe, based on our credit policies and
    our provisions for credit



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

losses, that our financial position, results of operations and
    cash flows will not be materially affected as a result of
    nonperformance by any single counterparty.

AEM’s estimated credit exposure is monitored in terms of
    the percentage of its customers, including affiliate customers,
    that are rated as investment grade versus non-investment grade.
    Credit exposure is defined as the total of (1) accounts
    receivable, (2) delivered, but unbilled physical sales and
    (3) mark-to-market exposure for sales and purchases.
    Investment grade determinations are set internally by AEM’s
    credit department, but are primarily based on external ratings
    provided by Moody’s Investors Service Inc. (Moody’s)

and/or

Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P). For
    non-rated entities, the default rating for municipalities is
    investment grade, while the default rating for non-guaranteed
    industrials and commercials is non-investment grade. The
    following table shows the percentages related to the investment
    ratings as of September 30, 2007 and 2006.

The following table presents our derivative counterparty credit
    exposure by operating segment based upon the unrealized fair
    value of our derivative contracts that represent assets as of
    September 30, 2007. Investment grade counterparties have
    minimum credit ratings of BBB-, assigned by Standard &
    Poor’s Rating Group; or Baa3, assigned by Moody’s
    Investor Service. Non-investment grade counterparties are
    composed of counterparties that are below investment grade or
    that have not been assigned an internal investment grade rating
    due to the short-term nature of the contracts associated with
    that counterparty. This category is composed of numerous smaller
    counterparties, none of which is individually significant.

Segment
    Information

Atmos Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries are engaged
    primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution,
    transmission and storage business as well as other nonregulated
    businesses. We distribute natural gas through sales and
    transportation arrangements to approximately 3.2 million
    residential, commercial, public authority and industrial
    customers through our six regulated natural gas distribution
    divisions, which cover service areas located in 12 states.
    In addition, we transport natural gas for others through our
    distribution system.

Through our nonregulated businesses, we primarily provide
    natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities,
    other local distribution companies and industrial customers
    located in 22 states. Additionally, we provide natural gas
    transportation and storage services to certain of our natural
    gas distribution operations and to third parties.

Through August 31, 2007, our operations were divided into
    four segments:

•

The

utility segment

, which included our regulated natural
    gas distribution and related sales operations,

•

The

natural gas marketing segment

, which included a
    variety of nonregulated natural gas management services,

•

The

pipeline and storage segment

, which included our
    regulated and nonregulated natural gas transmission and storage
    services and

•

The

other nonutility segment

, which included all of our
    other nonregulated nonutility operations.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we completed a series
    of organizational changes and began reporting the results of our
    operations under the following new segments, effective
    September 1, 2007:

•

The

natural gas distribution segment

, formerly referred
    to as the utility segment, includes our regulated natural gas
    distribution and related sales operations.

•

The

regulated transmission and storage segment

includes
    the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division. These operations were
    previously included in the pipeline and storage segment.

•

The

natural gas marketing segment

remains unchanged and
    includes a variety of nonregulated natural gas management
    services.

•

The

pipeline, storage and other segment

is primarily
    comprised of our nonregulated natural gas transmission and
    storage services, which were previously included in the pipeline
    and storage segment.

Our determination of reportable segments considers the strategic
    operating units under which we manage sales of various products
    and services to customers in differing regulatory environments.
    Although our natural gas distribution segment operations are
    geographically dispersed, they are reported as a single segment
    as each natural gas distribution division has similar economic
    characteristics. The accounting policies of the segments are the
    same as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies. We evaluate performance based on net income or loss of
    the respective operating units. Interest expense is allocated
    pro rata to each segment based upon our net investment in each
    segment. Income taxes are allocated to each segment as if each
    segment’s taxes were calculated on a separate return basis.

Selected
    Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

Summarized unaudited quarterly financial data is presented
    below. The sum of net income per share by quarter may not equal
    the net income per share for the year due to variations in the
    weighted average shares outstanding used in computing such
    amounts. Our businesses are seasonal due to weather conditions
    in our service areas. For further information on its effects on
    quarterly results, see the “Results of Operations”

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors

Atmos Energy Corporation

We have audited Atmos Energy Corporation’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of September 30, 2007, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Atmos Energy
    Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Atmos Energy Corporation maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of September 30, 2007, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2007 and
    2006, and the related statements of income, stockholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended September 30 2007 of Atmos Energy Corporation and our
    report dated November 27, 2007 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.
