ITEM 1.

Business.

Overview
    and Strategy

Atmos Energy Corporation, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is
    engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and
    transmission and storage businesses as well as other
    nonregulated natural gas businesses. Since our incorporation in
    Texas in 1983, we have grown primarily through a series of
    acquisitions, the most recent of which was the acquisition in
    October 2004 of the natural gas distribution and pipeline
    operations of TXU Gas Company. We are also incorporated in the
    state of Virginia.

Today, we distribute natural gas through regulated sales and
    transportation arrangements to over three million residential,
    commercial, public authority and industrial customers in
    12 states located primarily in the South, which makes us
    one of the country’s largest natural-gas-only distributors
    based on number of customers. In May 2011, we announced that we
    had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our natural gas
    distribution operations in Missouri, Illinois and Iowa,
    representing approximately 84,000 customers. After the closing
    of this transaction, we will operate in nine states. We also
    operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in Texas based
    on miles of pipe.

Through our nonregulated businesses, we primarily provide
    natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities,
    other local gas distribution companies and industrial customers
    principally in the Midwest and Southeast and natural gas
    transportation along with storage services to certain of our
    natural gas distribution divisions and third parties.

Our overall strategy is to:

•

deliver superior shareholder value,

•

improve the quality and consistency of earnings growth, while
    safely operating our regulated and nonregulated businesses
    exceptionally well and

•

enhance and strengthen a culture built on our core values.

We have continued to grow our earnings after giving effect to
    our acquisitions and have experienced more than 25 consecutive
    years of increasing dividends. Historically, we achieved this
    record of growth through acquisitions while efficiently managing
    our operating and maintenance expenses and leveraging our
    technology to achieve more efficient operations. In recent
    years, we have also achieved growth by implementing rate designs
    that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the
    recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns.
    In addition, we have developed various commercial opportunities
    within our regulated transmission and storage operations.

Our core values include focusing on our employees and customers
    while conducting our business with honesty and integrity. We
    continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing
    communications with our employees and enhanced employee training.

Operating
    Segments

We operate the Company through the following three segments:

•

The

natural gas distribution segment

, which includes our
    regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations,

•

The

regulated transmission and storage segment

, which
    includes the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our
    Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division and



•

The

nonregulated segment

, which includes our nonregulated
    natural gas management, nonregulated natural gas transmission,
    storage and other services.

These operating segments are described in greater detail below.

Natural
    Gas Distribution Segment Overview

Our natural gas distribution segment consists of the following
    six regulated divisions, presented in order of total rate base,
    covering service areas in 12 states:

•

Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division,

•

Atmos Energy Kentucky/Mid-States Division,

•

Atmos Energy Louisiana Division,

•

Atmos Energy West Texas Division,

•

Atmos Energy Mississippi Division and

•

Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division

Our natural gas distribution business is a seasonal business.
    Gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater
    during the winter months than during the remainder of the year.
    The volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with
    the temperatures during these months.

Revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory
    authorities in the states in which we operate. These rates are
    intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting
    business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital.
    Our primary service areas are located in Colorado, Kansas,
    Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. We have
    more limited service areas in Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri
    and Virginia. See Note 6 in the consolidated financial
    statements for a complete description of the anticipated sale of
    our Illinois, Iowa and Missouri service areas. In addition, we
    transport natural gas for others through our distribution system.

Rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost
    adjustment mechanisms for costs that (i) are subject to
    significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs,
    (ii) represent a large component of our cost of service and
    (iii) are generally outside our control.

Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form
    of cost adjustment mechanism. Purchased gas cost adjustment
    mechanisms provide natural gas utility companies a method of
    recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without
    filing a rate case because they provide a

dollar-for-dollar

offset to increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas
    costs. Therefore, although substantially all of our natural gas
    distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas
    that we purchase, natural gas distribution gross profit (which
    is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost) is
    generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas.

Additionally, some jurisdictions have introduced
    performance-based ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives
    to natural gas utilities to minimize purchased gas costs through
    improved storage management and use of financial instruments to
    lock in gas costs. Under the performance-based ratemaking
    adjustment, purchased gas costs savings are shared between the
    utility and its customers.

Finally, regulatory authorities have approved weather
    normalization adjustments (WNA) for approximately
    94 percent of residential and commercial margins in our
    service areas as a part of our rates. WNA minimizes the effect
    of weather that is above or below normal by allowing us to
    increase customers’ bills to offset lower gas usage when
    weather is warmer than normal and decrease customers’ bills
    to offset higher gas usage when weather is colder than normal.



As of September 30, 2011 we had WNA for our residential and
    commercial meters in the following service areas for the
    following periods:

Georgia, Kansas, West Texas

October — May

Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Mid-Tex

November — April

Louisiana

December — March

Virginia

January — December

Our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers,
    including independent producers, marketers and pipeline
    companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted
    storage assets. Additionally, the natural gas supply for our
    Mid-Tex Division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements.

Supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply
    (peaking) quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a
    firm basis with various terms at market prices. Base load
    quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout
    the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to
    change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in
    requirements related to weather conditions.

Except for local production purchases, we select our natural gas
    suppliers through a competitive bidding process by periodically
    requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that
    they can provide reliable service. We select these suppliers
    based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated
    firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest cost. Major suppliers
    during fiscal 2011 were Anadarko Energy Services, BP Energy
    Company, ConocoPhillips, Devon Gas Services, L.P., Enbridge
    Marketing (US) L.P., Iberdrola Renewables, Inc., National Fuel
    Marketing Company, LLC, ONEOK Energy Services Company L.P.,
    Tenaska Marketing and Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC, our natural
    gas marketing subsidiary.

The combination of base load, peaking and spot purchase
    agreements, coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage,
    allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather, which
    minimizes our need to enter into long-term firm commitments. We
    estimate our

peak-day

availability of natural gas supply to be approximately
    4.4 Bcf. The

peak-day

demand for our natural gas distribution operations in fiscal
    2011 was on February 2, 2011, when sales to customers
    reached approximately 4.4 Bcf.

Currently, our natural gas distribution divisions, except for
    our Mid-Tex Division, utilize 45 pipeline transportation
    companies, both interstate and intrastate, to transport our
    natural gas. The pipeline transportation agreements are firm and
    many of them have “pipeline no-notice” storage
    service, which provides for daily balancing between system
    requirements and nominated flowing supplies. These agreements
    have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while
    still maintaining our right of first refusal. The natural gas
    supply for our Mid-Tex Division is delivered primarily by our
    Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division.

To maintain our deliveries to high priority customers, we have
    the ability, and have exercised our right, to curtail deliveries
    to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts
    or applicable state regulations or statutes. Our customers’
    demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our
    ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or
    immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the
    physical limitations of gathering, storage and transmission
    systems, the duration and severity of cold weather, the
    availability of gas reserves from our suppliers, the ability to
    purchase additional supplies on a short-term basis and actions
    by federal and state regulatory authorities. Curtailment rights
    provide us the flexibility to meet the human-needs requirements
    of our customers on a firm basis. Priority allocations imposed
    by federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as other
    factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to meet the
    demands of our customers. We anticipate no problems with
    obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers.

Below, we briefly describe our six natural gas distribution
    divisions. We operate in our service areas under terms of
    non-exclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities
    and towns that we serve. At September 30, 2011, we held
    1,116 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to
    35 years. A significant number of our franchises expire
    each year, which require renewal prior to the end of their
    terms. We believe that we will be able to renew our franchises
    as they expire. Additional information concerning our natural
    gas distribution divisions is presented under the caption
    “Operating Statistics”.



Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division.

Our Mid-Tex
    Division serves approximately 550 incorporated and
    unincorporated communities in the north-central, eastern and
    western parts of Texas, including the Dallas/Fort Worth
    Metroplex. The governing body of each municipality we serve has
    original jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates,
    operations and services within its city limits, except with
    respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel and
    agricultural use. The Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) has
    exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory
    orders and ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive
    original jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not
    located within the limits of a municipality.

Prior to fiscal 2008, this division operated under one
    system-wide rate structure. However, in fiscal 2008, we reached
    a settlement with cities representing approximately
    80 percent of this division’s customers (Settled
    Cities) that has allowed us, beginning in fiscal 2008, to update
    rates for customers in these cities through an annual rate
    review mechanism (RRM). Rates for the remaining 20 percent
    of this division’s customers, primarily the City of Dallas,
    continue to be updated through periodic formal rate proceedings
    and filings made under Texas’ Gas Reliability
    Infrastructure Program (GRIP). GRIP allows us to include in our
    rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior
    calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at
    least once every five years. In June 2011, we reached an
    agreement with the City of Dallas to enter into the Dallas
    Annual Rate Review (DARR). This rate review provides for an
    annual rate review without the necessity of filing a general
    rate case. The first filing made under this mechanism will be in
    January 2012.

Atmos Energy Kentucky/Mid-States Division.

Our
    Kentucky/Mid-States Division operates in more than 420
    communities across Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri,
    Tennessee and Virginia. The service areas in these states are
    primarily rural; however, this division serves Franklin,
    Tennessee and other suburban areas of Nashville. We update our
    rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings made
    with each state’s public service commission.

In May 2011, we announced that we had entered into a definitive
    agreement to sell our natural gas distribution operations in
    Missouri, Illinois and Iowa, representing approximately 189
    communities, some of which of the Missouri communities are
    located in our Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division.

Atmos Energy Louisiana Division.

In Louisiana,
    we serve nearly 300 communities, including the suburban areas of
    New Orleans, the metropolitan area of Monroe and western
    Louisiana. Direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers
    in Louisiana, who use gas for fuel or in manufacturing
    processes, and sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel are exempt
    from regulation and are recognized in our nonregulated segment.
    Our rates in this division are updated annually through a rate
    stabilization clause filing without filing a formal rate case.

Atmos Energy West Texas Division.

Our West
    Texas Division serves approximately 80 communities in West
    Texas, including the Amarillo, Lubbock and Midland areas. Like
    our Mid-Tex Division, each municipality we serve has original
    jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates, operations and
    services within its city limits, with the RRC having exclusive
    appellate jurisdiction over the municipalities and exclusive
    original jurisdiction over rates and services provided to
    customers not located within the limits of a municipality. Prior
    to fiscal 2008, rates were updated in this division through
    formal rate proceedings. However, the West Texas Division
    entered into agreements with its West Texas service areas during
    fiscal 2008 and its Amarillo and Lubbock service areas during
    fiscal 2009 to update rates for customers in these service areas
    through an RRM.

Atmos Energy Mississippi Division.

In
    Mississippi, we serve about 110 communities throughout the
    northern half of the state, including the Jackson metropolitan
    area. Our rates in the Mississippi Division are updated annually
    through a stable rate filing without filing a formal rate case.



Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division.

Our
    Colorado-Kansas Division serves approximately 170 communities
    throughout Colorado and Kansas and parts of Missouri, including
    the cities of Olathe, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City and
    Greeley, Colorado, located near Denver. We update our rates in
    this division through periodic formal rate filings made with
    each state’s public service commission.

A heating degree day is equivalent to each degree that the
    average of the high and the low temperatures for a day is below
    65 degrees. The colder the climate, the greater the number of
    heating degree days.



Regulated
    Transmission and Storage Segment Overview

Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the
    regulated pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division. This division transports
    natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division, transports natural gas for
    third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in
    Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary in the
    pipeline industry including parking and lending arrangements and
    sales of inventory on hand. Parking arrangements provide
    short-term interruptible storage of gas on our pipeline. Lending
    services provide short-term interruptible loans of natural gas
    from our pipeline to meet market demands. Gross profit earned
    from our Mid-Tex Division and through certain other
    transportation and storage services is subject to traditional
    ratemaking governed by the RRC. Rates are updated through
    periodic formal rate proceedings and filings made under
    Texas’ Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program (GRIP). GRIP
    allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital
    costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file
    a complete rate case at least once every five years. Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas’ existing regulatory mechanisms
    allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided
    under market-based rates with minimal regulation.

These operations include one of the largest intrastate pipeline
    operations in Texas with a heavy concentration in the
    established natural gas-producing areas of central, northern and
    eastern Texas, extending into or near the major producing areas
    of the Texas Gulf Coast and the Delaware and Val Verde Basins of
    West Texas. Nine basins located in Texas are believed to contain
    a substantial portion of the nation’s remaining onshore
    natural gas reserves. This pipeline system provides access to
    all of these basins.

Transportation volumes and operating revenues reflect segment
    operations, including intercompany sales and transportation
    amounts.

Nonregulated
    Segment Overview

Our nonregulated activities are conducted through Atmos Energy
    Holdings, Inc. (AEH), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Atmos Energy Corporation and operates primarily in the Midwest
    and Southeast areas of the United States.



AEH’s primary business is to deliver gas and provide
    related services by aggregating and purchasing gas supply,
    arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately
    delivering gas to customers at competitive prices. In addition,
    AEH utilizes proprietary and customer-owned transportation and
    storage assets to provide various delivered gas services our
    customers request, including furnishing natural gas supplies at
    fixed and market-based prices, contract negotiation and
    administration, load forecasting, gas storage acquisition and
    management services, transportation services, peaking sales and
    balancing services, capacity utilization strategies and gas
    price hedging through the use of financial instruments. As a
    result, AEH’s gas delivery and related services margins
    arise from the types of commercial transactions we have
    structured with our customers and our ability to identify the
    lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies,
    transportation and markets to which it has access to serve those
    customers.

AEH’s storage and transportation margins arise from
    (i) utilizing its proprietary

21-mile

pipeline located in New Orleans, Louisiana to aggregate gas
    supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in
    Louisiana, its gas delivery activities and, on a more limited
    basis, for third parties and (ii) managing proprietary
    storage in Kentucky and Louisiana to supplement the natural gas
    needs of our natural gas distribution divisions during peak
    periods.

AEH also seeks to enhance its gross profit margin by maximizing,
    through asset optimization activities, the economic value
    associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns
    or controls in our natural gas distribution and by its
    subsidiaries. We attempt to meet these objectives by engaging in
    natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and
    profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various
    locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over
    time. This process involves purchasing physical natural gas,
    storing it in the storage and transportation assets to which AEH
    has access and selling financial instruments at advantageous
    prices to lock in a gross profit margin. Certain of these
    arrangements are with regulatory affiliates, which have been
    approved by applicable state regulatory commissions.

Due to the nature of these operations, natural gas prices and
    differences in natural gas prices between the various markets
    that we serve (commonly referred to as basis differentials) have
    a significant impact on our nonregulated businesses. Within our
    delivered gas activities, basis differentials impact our ability
    to create value from identifying the lowest cost alternative
    among the natural gas supplies, transportation and markets to
    which we have access. Further, higher natural gas prices may
    adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting
    in higher bad debt expense, and may require us to increase
    borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher
    interest expense. Higher gas prices, as well as competitive
    factors in the industry and general economic conditions may also
    cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources.
    Within our asset optimization activities, higher natural gas
    prices could also lead to increased borrowings under our credit
    facilities resulting in higher interest expense.

Volatility in natural gas prices also has a significant impact
    on our nonregulated segment. Increased price volatility often
    has a significant impact on the spreads between the market
    (spot) prices and forward natural gas prices, which creates
    opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads within our asset
    optimization activities. Volatility could also impact the basis
    differentials we capture in our delivered gas activities.
    However, increased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized
    margins recorded in our gross profit and could impact the amount
    of cash required to collateralize our risk management
    liabilities.

Ratemaking
    Activity

Overview

The method of determining regulated rates varies among the
    states in which our natural gas distribution divisions operate.
    The regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring
    that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best
    interests of customers while providing utility companies the
    opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment.
    Generally, each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and
    establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue
    sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to
    provide a reasonable return on invested capital.

Our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory
    lag, obtaining adequate returns and providing stable,
    predictable margins. Atmos Energy has annual ratemaking
    mechanisms in place in three states that provide for an annual
    rate review and adjustment to rates for approximately
    73 percent of our gross margin. We also have accelerated
    recovery of capital for approximately 11 percent of our
    gross margin. Combined, we have rate structures with accelerated
    recovery of all or a portion of our expenditures for
    approximately 84 percent of our gross margin. Additionally,
    we have WNA mechanisms in eight states that serve to minimize
    the effects of weather on approximately 94 percent of our
    gross margin. Finally, we have the ability to recover the gas
    cost portion of bad debts for approximately 73 percent of
    our gross margin. These mechanisms work in tandem to provide
    substantial insulation from volatile margins, both for the
    Company and our customers.

We will also continue to address various rate design changes,
    including the recovery of bad debt gas costs and inclusion of
    other taxes in gas costs in future rate filings. These design
    changes would address cost variations that are related to
    pass-through energy costs beyond our control.

Although substantial progress has been made in recent years by
    improving rate design across Atmos Energy’s operating
    areas, potential changes in federal energy policy and adverse
    economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the
    Company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented
    by these external factors.

Substantially all of our natural gas distribution revenues in
    the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009
    were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval
    by local or state authorities. Net operating income increases
    resulting from ratemaking activity totaling $72.4 million,
    $56.8 million and $54.4 million, became effective in
    fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 as summarized below:

Rate
    Case Filings

A rate case is a formal request from Atmos Energy to a
    regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to
    customers. Rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory
    authorities request us to justify our rates. This process is
    referred to as a “show cause” action. Adequate rates
    are intended to provide for recovery of the Company’s costs
    as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure
    that we continue to



safely deliver reliable, reasonably priced natural gas service
    to our customers. The following table summarizes our recent rate

In its final order, the RRC approved a $3.0 million
    increase in operating income from customers in the
    Dallas & Environs portion of the Mid-Tex Division.
    Operating income should increase $0.2 million, net of the
    GRIP 2008 rates that will be superseded. The ruling also
    provided for regulatory accounting treatment for certain costs
    related to storage assets and costs moving from our Mid-Tex
    Division within our natural gas distribution segment to our
    regulated transmission and storage segment.



Infrastructure
    Programs

As discussed above in “Natural Gas Distribution Segment
    Overview,” infrastructure programs such as GRIP allow
    natural gas distribution companies the opportunity to include in
    their rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the
    prior calendar year. We currently have infrastructure programs
    in Texas, Georgia, Missouri and Kentucky. The following table

Annual
    Rate Filing Mechanisms

As an instrument to reduce regulatory lag, annual rate filing
    mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on a periodic basis
    without filing a formal rate case. However, these filings still
    involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities
    prior to the final determination of rates under these
    mechanisms. As discussed above in “Natural Gas Distribution
    Segment Overview,” we currently have annual rate filing
    mechanisms in our Louisiana and Mississippi divisions and in
    significant portions of our Mid-Tex and West Texas divisions.
    These mechanisms are referred to as rate review mechanisms in
    our Mid-Tex and West Texas divisions, stable rate filings in the
    Mississippi Division and the rate stabilization clause in the
    Louisiana Division. The following table summarizes filings made
    under our various annual rate filing mechanisms:

In June 2011, we reached an agreement with the City of Dallas to
    enter into the DARR. This rate review provides for an annual
    rate review without the necessity of filing a general rate case.
    The first filing made under this mechanism will be in January
    2012.



In August 2010, we reached an agreement to extend the RRM in our
    Mid-Tex Division for an additional two-year period beginning
    October 1, 2010; however, the Mid-Tex Division will be
    required to file a general system-wide rate case on or before
    June 1, 2013. This extension provides for an annual rate
    adjustment to reflect changes in the Mid-Tex Division’s
    costs of service and additions to capital investment from year
    to year, without the necessity of filing a general rate case.

The settlement also allows us to expand our existing program to
    replace steel service lines in the Mid-Tex Division’s
    natural gas delivery system. On October 13, 2010, the City
    of Dallas approved the recovery of the return, depreciation and
    taxes associated with the replacement of 100,000 steel service
    lines across the Mid-Tex Division by September 30, 2012.
    The RRM in the Mid-Tex Division was entered into as a result of
    a settlement in the September 20, 2007 Statement of Intent
    case filed with all Mid-Tex Division cities. Of the 440
    incorporated cities served by the Mid-Tex Division, 439 of these
    cities are part of the RRM process.

The West Texas RRM was entered into in August 2008 as a result
    of a settlement with the West Texas Coalition of Cities. The
    Lubbock and Amarillo RRMs were entered into in the spring of
    2009. The West Texas Coalition of Cities agreed to extend its
    RRM for one additional cycle as part of the settlement of this
    fiscal year’s filing.

During fiscal 2011, the RRC’s Division of Public Safety
    issued a new rule requiring natural gas distribution companies
    to develop and implement a risk-based program for the renewal or
    replacement of distribution facilities, including steel service
    lines. The rule allows for the deferral of all expense
    associated with capital expenditures incurred pursuant to this
    rule, including the recording of interest on the deferred
    expenses.

Other
    Regulation

Each of our natural gas distribution divisions is regulated by
    various state or local public utility authorities. We are also
    subject to regulation by the United States Department of
    Transportation with respect to safety requirements in the
    operation and maintenance of our gas distribution facilities. In
    addition, our distribution operations are also subject to
    various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters.
    From time to time we receive inquiries regarding various
    environmental matters. We believe that our properties and
    operations substantially comply with, and are operated in
    substantial conformity with, applicable safety and environmental
    statutes and regulations. There are no administrative or
    judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality
    statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental
    agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our
    operations. Our environmental claims have arisen primarily from
    former manufactured gas plant sites in Tennessee, Iowa and
    Missouri.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allows, pursuant
    to Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, gas
    transportation services through our Atmos Pipeline —
    Texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or
    local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines,
    without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the FERC.
    Additionally, the FERC has regulatory authority over the sale of
    natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release
    of interstate pipeline and storage capacity, as well as
    authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to
    enforce compliance with FERC’s other rules, policies and
    orders by companies engaged in the sale, purchase,
    transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce.
    We have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate
    steps to comply with these regulations.

Competition

Although our natural gas distribution operations are not
    currently in significant direct competition with any other
    distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial
    customers within our service areas, we do compete with other
    natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for
    sales to industrial customers. We compete in all aspects of our
    business with alternative energy sources, including, in
    particular, electricity. Electric utilities offer electricity as
    a rival energy source and compete for the space heating, water
    heating and cooking markets. Promotional incentives, improved
    equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to
    the acceptability of electrical equipment. The principal means
    to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices, and
    natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in
    the residential, commercial and industrial markets.

Our regulated transmission and storage operations historically
    have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate
    pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange
    transportation, storage and other services for customers.
    However, in the last few years, several new pipelines have been
    completed, which has increased the level of competition in this
    segment of our business.

Within our nonregulated operations, AEM competes with other
    natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and
    other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring
    higher levels of balancing, scheduling and other related
    management services. AEM has experienced increased competition
    in recent years primarily from investment banks and major
    integrated oil and natural gas companies who offer lower cost,
    basic services. The increased competition has reduced margins
    most notably on its high-volume accounts.

Employees

At September 30, 2011, we had 4,949 employees,
    consisting of 4,817 employees in our regulated operations
    and 132 employees in our nonregulated operations.

Corporate
    Governance

In accordance with and pursuant to relevant related rules and
    regulations of the SEC as well as corporate governance-related
    listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the
    Board of Directors of the Company has established and
    periodically updated our Corporate Governance Guidelines and
    Code of Conduct, which is applicable to all directors, officers
    and employees of the Company. In addition, in accordance with
    and pursuant to such NYSE listing standards, our Chief Executive
    Officer during fiscal 2011, Kim R. Cocklin, certified to the New
    York Stock Exchange that he was not aware of any violations by
    the Company of NYSE corporate governance listing standards. The
    Board of Directors also annually reviews and updates, if
    necessary, the charters for each of its Audit, Human Resources
    and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees. All of the
    foregoing documents are posted on the Corporate Governance page
    of our website. We will also provide copies of all corporate
    governance documents free of charge upon request to Shareholder

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

Our financial and operating results are subject to a number of
    risk factors, many of which are not within our control. Although
    we have tried to discuss key risk factors below, please be aware
    that other or new risks may prove to be important in the future.
    Investors should carefully consider the following discussion of
    risk factors as well as other information appearing in this
    report. These factors include the following:

Further
    disruptions in the credit markets could limit our ability to
    access capital and increase our costs of capital.

We rely upon access to both short-term and long-term credit
    markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements. The global credit
    markets have experienced significant disruptions and volatility
    during the last few years to a greater degree than has been seen
    in decades. In some cases, the ability or willingness of
    traditional sources of capital to provide financing has been
    reduced.

Our long-term debt is currently rated as “investment
    grade” by Standard & Poor’s Corporation,
    Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. If
    adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation
    on our access to the private and public credit markets, we could
    see a reduction in our liquidity. A significant reduction in our
    liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings
    outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more
    of the three credit rating agencies. Such a downgrade could
    further limit our access to public

and/or

private credit markets and increase the costs of borrowing under
    each source of credit.

Further, if our credit ratings were downgraded, we could be
    required to provide additional liquidity to our nonregulated
    segment because the commodity financial instruments markets
    could become unavailable to us. Our nonregulated segment depends
    primarily upon a committed credit facility to finance its
    working capital needs, which it uses primarily to issue standby
    letters of credit to its natural gas suppliers. A significant
    reduction in the availability of this facility could require us
    to provide extra liquidity to support its operations or reduce
    some of the activities of our nonregulated segment. Our ability
    to provide extra liquidity is limited by the terms of our
    existing lending arrangements with AEH, which are subject to
    annual approval by one state regulatory commission.



While we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our
    operations and the sources of financing available to us, we can
    provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so
    in the future, especially if the market price of natural gas
    increases significantly in the near-term. The future effects on
    our business, liquidity and financial results of a further
    deterioration of current conditions in the credit markets could
    be material and adverse to us, both in the ways described above
    or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate.

The
    continuation of recent economic conditions could adversely
    affect our customers and negatively impact our financial
    results.

The slowdown in the U.S. economy in the last few years,
    together with increased mortgage defaults and significant
    decreases in the values of homes and investment assets, has
    adversely affected the financial resources of many domestic
    households. It is unclear whether the administrative and
    legislative responses to these conditions will be successful in
    improving current economic conditions, including the lowering of
    current high unemployment rates across the U.S. As a
    result, our customers may seek to use even less gas and it may
    become more difficult for them to pay their gas bills. This may
    slow collections and lead to higher than normal levels of
    accounts receivable. This in turn could increase our financing
    requirements and bad debt expense. Additionally, our industrial
    customers may seek alternative energy sources, which could
    result in lower sales volumes.

The
    costs of providing pension and postretirement health care
    benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes
    in pension fund values, changing demographics and fluctuating
    actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse effect on
    our financial results. In addition, the passage of the Health
    Care Reform Act in 2010 could significantly increase the cost of
    the health care benefits for our employees.

We provide a cash-balance pension plan and postretirement
    healthcare benefits to eligible full-time employees. Our costs
    of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are
    subject to changes in the market value of the assets funding our
    pension and postretirement healthcare plans. The fluctuations
    over the last few years in the values of investments that fund
    our pension and postretirement healthcare plans may
    significantly differ from or alter the values and actuarial
    assumptions we use to calculate our future pension plan expense
    and postretirement healthcare costs and funding requirements
    under the Pension Protection Act. Any significant declines in
    the value of these investments could increase the expenses of
    our pension and postretirement healthcare plans and related
    funding requirements in the future. Our costs of providing such
    benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to
    changing demographics, including longer life expectancy of
    beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible
    former employees over the next five to ten years, as well as
    various actuarial calculations and assumptions, which may differ
    materially from actual results due to changing market and
    economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates and
    interest rates and other factors. Also, our costs of providing
    such benefits are subject to the continuing recovery of these
    costs through rates.

In addition, the costs of providing health care benefits to our
    employees could significantly increase over the next five to ten
    years. Although the full effects of the Health Care Reform Act
    should not impact the Company until 2014, the future cost of
    compliance with the provisions of this legislation is difficult
    to measure at this time.

Our
    operations are exposed to market risks that are beyond our
    control which could adversely affect our financial results and
    capital requirements.

Our risk management operations are subject to market risks
    beyond our control, including market liquidity, commodity price
    volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics and
    counterparty creditworthiness. Although we maintain a risk
    management policy, we may not be able to completely offset the
    price risk associated with volatile gas prices, particularly in
    our nonregulated business segments, which could lead to
    volatility in our earnings.



Physical trading in our nonregulated business segments also
    introduces price risk on any net open positions at the end of
    each trading day, as well as volatility resulting from

intra-day

fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price
    movements between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for
    future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is
    hedged. The determination of our net open position as of the end
    of any particular trading day requires us to make assumptions as
    to future circumstances, including the use of gas by our
    customers in relation to our anticipated storage and market
    positions. Because the price risk associated with any net open
    position at the end of such day may increase if the assumptions
    are not realized, we review these assumptions as part of our
    daily monitoring activities. Although we manage our business to
    maintain no open positions, there are times when limited net
    open positions related to our physical storage may occur on a
    short-term basis. Net open positions may increase volatility in
    our financial condition or results of operations if market
    prices move in a significantly favorable or unfavorable manner
    before the open positions can be closed.

Further, the timing of the recognition for financial accounting
    purposes of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair
    value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges
    usually does not match the timing of the economic profits or
    losses on the item being hedged. This volatility may occur with
    a resulting increase or decrease in earnings or losses, even
    though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from
    the date the transactions were consummated. Also, if the local
    physical markets in which we trade do not move consistently with
    the NYMEX futures market upon which most of our commodity
    derivative financial instruments are valued, we could experience
    increased volatility in the financial results of our
    nonregulated segment.

Our nonregulated segment manages margins and limits risk
    exposure on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting
    fixed-price purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities
    of natural gas through the use of a variety of financial
    instruments. However, contractual limitations could adversely
    affect our ability to withdraw gas from storage, which could
    cause us to purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to
    obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts. We
    could also realize financial losses on our efforts to limit risk
    as a result of volatility in the market prices of the underlying
    commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a
    contract. Any significant tightening of the credit markets could
    cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform than
    expected. In addition, adverse changes in the creditworthiness
    of our counterparties could limit the level of trading
    activities with these parties and increase the risk that these
    parties may not perform under a contract. These circumstances
    could also increase our capital requirements.

We are also subject to interest rate risk on our borrowings. In
    recent years, we have been operating in a relatively low
    interest-rate environment compared to historical norms for both
    short and long-term interest rates. However, increases in
    interest rates could adversely affect our future financial
    results.

We are
    subject to state and local regulations that affect our
    operations and financial results.

Our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and
    storage segments are subject to various regulated returns on our
    rate base in each jurisdiction in which we operate. We monitor
    the allowed rates of return and our effectiveness in earning
    such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating changes as
    we believe they are needed. In addition, in the normal course of
    business in the regulatory environment, assets may be placed in
    service and historical test periods established before rate
    cases can be filed that could result in an adjustment of our
    allowed returns. Once rate cases are filed, regulatory bodies
    have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates
    while studying the cases. Because of this process, we must
    suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in
    service without the benefit of rate relief, which is commonly
    referred to as “regulatory lag.” Rate cases also
    involve a risk of rate reduction, because once rates have been
    approved, they are still subject to challenge for their
    reasonableness by appropriate regulatory authorities. In
    addition, regulators may review our purchases of natural gas and
    can adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to
    our customers. Finally, our debt and equity financings are also
    subject to approval by regulatory commissions in several states,
    which could limit our ability to access or take advantage of
    rapid changes in the capital markets.



We may
    experience increased federal, state and local regulation of the
    safety of our operations.

We are committed to constantly monitoring and maintaining our
    pipeline and distribution system to ensure that natural gas is
    delivered safely, reliably and efficiently through our network
    of more than 76,000 miles of pipeline and distribution
    lines. The pipeline replacement programs currently underway in
    several of our divisions typify the preventive maintenance and
    continual renewal that we perform on our natural gas
    distribution system in the 12 states in which we currently
    operate. The safety and protection of the public, our customers
    and our employees is our top priority. However, due primarily to
    the recent unfortunate pipeline incident in California, we
    anticipate companies in the natural gas distribution business
    may be subjected to even greater federal, state and local
    oversight of the safety of their operations in the future.
    Although we believe these costs are ultimately recoverable
    through our rates, costs of complying with such increased
    regulations may have at least a short-term adverse impact on our
    operating costs and financial results.

Some
    of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory
    oversight that could affect our operations and financial
    results.

FERC has regulatory authority that affects some of our
    operations, including sales of natural gas in the wholesale gas
    market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and
    storage capacity. Under legislation passed by Congress in 2005,
    FERC has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse
    and market manipulation and to promote compliance with
    FERC’s other rules, policies and orders by companies
    engaged in the sale, purchase, transportation or storage of
    natural gas in interstate commerce. These rules carry increased
    penalties for violations. We are currently under investigation
    by FERC for possible violations of its posting and competitive
    bidding regulations for pre-arranged released firm capacity on
    interstate natural gas pipelines. Should FERC conclude that we
    have committed such violations of its regulations and levies
    substantial fines and/or penalties against us, our business,
    financial condition or financial results could be adversely
    affected. Although we have taken steps to structure current and
    future transactions to comply with applicable current FERC
    regulations, changes in FERC regulations or their interpretation
    by FERC or additional regulations issued by FERC in the future
    could also adversely affect our business, financial condition or
    financial results.

We are
    subject to environmental regulations which could adversely
    affect our operations or financial results.

We are subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements
    enacted or adopted by federal, state and local governmental
    authorities relating to protection of the environment and health
    and safety matters, including those legal requirements that
    govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the
    management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, the

clean-up

of
    contaminated sites, groundwater quality and availability, plant
    and wildlife protection, as well as work practices related to
    employee health and safety. Environmental legislation also
    requires that our facilities, sites and other properties
    associated with our operations be operated, maintained,
    abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable
    regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with these laws,
    regulations, permits and licenses may expose us to fines,
    penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be
    significant to our financial results. In addition, existing
    environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may
    become subject to new regulations.

Our
    business may be subject in the future to additional regulatory
    and financial risks associated with global warming and climate
    change.

There have been a number of new federal and state legislative
    and regulatory initiatives proposed in an attempt to control or
    limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change,
    including greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide. For
    example, in June 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives
    approved

The American Clean Energy and Security Act of

, also known as the Waxman-Markey bill or “cap and
    trade” bill. However, neither this bill nor a related bill
    in the U.S. Senate, the Clean Energy and Emissions Power
    Act was passed by Congress. The adoption of this type of
    legislation by Congress or similar legislation by states or the
    adoption of related regulations by federal or state governments
    mandating a substantial



reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the future could have
    far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry.
    Such new legislation or regulations could result in increased
    compliance costs for us or additional operating restrictions on
    our business, affect the demand for natural gas or impact the
    prices we charge to our customers. At this time, we cannot
    predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations that
    may be adopted on our future business, financial condition or
    financial results.

The
    concentration of our distribution, pipeline and storage
    operations in the State of Texas exposes our operations and
    financial results to economic conditions and regulatory
    decisions in Texas.

Over 50 percent of our natural gas distribution customers
    and most of our pipeline and storage assets and operations are
    located in the State of Texas. This concentration of our
    business in Texas means that our operations and financial
    results may be significantly affected by changes in the Texas
    economy in general and regulatory decisions by state and local
    regulatory authorities in Texas.

Adverse
    weather conditions could affect our operations or financial
    results.

Since the

2006-2007

winter heating season, we have had weather-normalized rates for
    over 90 percent of our residential and commercial meters,
    which has substantially mitigated the adverse effects of

warmer-than-normal

weather for meters in those service areas. However, there is no
    assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory
    protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future. The
    loss of such weather — normalized rates could have an
    adverse effect on our operations and financial results. In
    addition, our natural gas distribution and regulated
    transmission and storage operating results may continue to vary
    somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating
    season. Sustained cold weather could adversely affect our
    nonregulated operations as we may be required to purchase gas at
    spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to
    fulfill some customer contracts. Additionally, sustained cold
    weather could challenge our ability to adequately meet customer
    demand in our natural gas distribution and regulated
    transmission and storage operations.

Inflation
    and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base
    and customer collections and increase our level of
    indebtedness.

Inflation has caused increases in some of our operating expenses
    and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs. We have
    a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our
    natural gas distribution gas rates in relation to the increasing
    cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in
    adjusting those gas rates. Historically, we have been able to
    budget and control operating expenses and investments within the
    amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to
    continue to do so. However, the ability to control expenses is
    an important factor that could impact future financial results.

Rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to
    experience a significant increase in short-term debt. We must
    pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased, which can be
    significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered
    through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas
    delivered. Increases in purchased gas costs also slow our
    natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are
    more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills, leading to
    higher than normal accounts receivable. This could result in
    higher short-term debt levels, greater collection efforts and
    increased bad debt expense.

Our
    growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our
    business, which requires extensive capital
    spending.

We must continually build additional capacity in our natural gas
    distribution system to enable us to serve any growth in the
    number of our customers. The cost of adding this capacity may be
    affected by a number of factors, including the general state of
    the economy and weather. In addition, although we should
    ultimately recover the cost of the expenditures through rates,
    we must make significant capital expenditures during the next
    fiscal year in executing our steel service line replacement
    program in the Mid-Tex Division. Our cash flows from operations
    generally are sufficient to supply funding for all our capital
    expenditures, including the financing of the costs of new
    construction along with capital expenditures necessary to
    maintain our existing



natural gas system. Due to the timing of these cash flows and
    capital expenditures, we often must fund at least a portion of
    these costs through borrowing funds from third party lenders,
    the cost and availability of which is dependent on the liquidity
    of the credit markets, interest rates and other market
    conditions. This in turn may limit our ability to connect new
    customers to our system due to constraints on the amount of
    funds we can invest in our infrastructure.

Our
    operations are subject to increased competition.

In residential and commercial customer markets, our natural gas
    distribution operations compete with other energy products, such
    as electricity and propane. Our primary product competition is
    with electricity for heating, water heating and cooking.
    Increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact
    our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of
    natural gas to the consumer. This could adversely impact our
    business if, as a result, our customer growth slows, reducing
    our ability to make capital expenditures, or if our customers
    further conserve their use of gas, resulting in reduced gas
    purchases and customer billings.

In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing
    plants, adverse economic conditions, including higher gas costs,
    could cause these customers to use alternative sources of
    energy, such as electricity, or bypass our systems in favor of
    special competitive contracts with lower

per-unit

costs. Our regulated transmission and storage operations
    historically have faced limited competition from other existing
    intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or
    arrange transportation, storage and other services for
    customers. However, in the last few years, several new pipelines
    have been completed, which has increased the level of
    competition in this segment of our business. Within our
    nonregulated operations, AEM competes with other natural gas
    marketers to provide natural gas management and other related
    services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels
    of balancing, scheduling and other related management services.
    AEM has experienced increased competition in recent years
    primarily from investment banks and major integrated oil and
    natural gas companies who offer lower cost, basic services.

Distributing
    and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in
    accidents and additional operating costs.

Our natural gas distribution business involves a number of
    hazards and operating risks that cannot be completely avoided,
    such as leaks, accidents and operational problems, which could
    cause loss of human life, as well as substantial financial
    losses resulting from property damage, damage to the environment
    and to our operations. We do have liability and property
    insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks.
    However, because our pipeline, storage and distribution
    facilities are near or are in populated areas, any loss of human
    life or adverse financial results resulting from such events
    could be large. If these events were not fully covered by
    insurance, our operations or financial results could be
    adversely affected.

Natural
    disasters, terrorist activities or other significant events
    could adversely affect our operations or financial
    results.

Natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and
    operations. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities
    could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in
    the price of natural gas that could affect our operations. Also,
    companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure
    to actual acts of terrorism, which could subject our operations
    to increased risks. As a result, the availability of insurance
    covering such risks may be more limited, which could increase
    the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or
    financial results.

Properties.

Distribution,
    transmission and related assets

At September 30, 2011, our natural gas distribution segment
    owned an aggregate of 70,869 miles of underground
    distribution and transmission mains throughout our gas
    distribution systems. These mains are located on easements or

rights-of-way

which generally provide for perpetual use. We maintain our mains
    through a program of continuous inspection and repair and
    believe that our system of mains is in good condition. Our
    regulated transmission and storage segment owned
    5,861 miles of gas transmission and gathering lines and our
    nonregulated segment owned 105 miles of gas transmission
    and gathering lines.

Storage
    Assets

We own underground gas storage facilities in several states to
    supplement the supply of natural gas in periods of peak demand.

ITEM 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

INTRODUCTION

This section provides management’s discussion of the
    financial condition, changes in financial condition and results
    of operations of Atmos Energy Corporation and its consolidated
    subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations
    and liquidity and capital resources. It includes
    management’s interpretation of our financial results, the
    factors affecting these results, the major factors expected to
    affect future operating results and future investment and
    financing plans. This discussion should be read in conjunction
    with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

Several factors exist that could influence our future financial
    performance, some of which are described in Item 1A above,
    “Risk Factors”. They should be considered in
    connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained
    in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since
    these factors could cause actual results and conditions to
    differ materially from those set out in such forward-looking
    statements.

Cautionary
    Statement for the Purposes of the Safe Harbor under the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

The statements contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

may contain “forward-looking statements” within the
    meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All
    statements other than statements of historical fact included in
    this Report are forward-looking statements made in good faith by
    us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from
    liability established by the Private Securities Litigation
    Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, or any other of
    our documents or oral presentations, the words
    “anticipate”, “believe”,
    “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”,
    “goal”, “intend”, “objective”,
    “plan”, “projection”, “seek”,
    “strategy” or similar words are intended to identify
    forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are
    subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
    results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in
    the statements relating to our strategy, operations, markets,
    services, rates, recovery of costs, availability of gas supply
    and other factors. These risks and uncertainties include the
    following: our ability to continue to access the credit markets
    to satisfy our liquidity requirements; the impact of adverse
    economic conditions on our customers; increased costs of
    providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and
    increased funding requirements along with increased costs of
    health care benefits; market risks beyond our control affecting
    our risk management activities including market liquidity,
    commodity price volatility, increasing interest rates and
    counterparty creditworthiness; regulatory trends and decisions,
    including the impact of rate proceedings before various state
    regulatory commissions; possible increased federal, state and
    local regulation of the safety of our operations; increased
    federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties; the impact
    of environmental regulations on our business; the impact of
    possible future additional regulatory and financial risks
    associated with global warming and climate change on our
    business; the concentration of our distribution, pipeline and
    storage operations in Texas; adverse weather conditions; the
    effects of inflation and changes in the availability and price
    of natural gas; the capital-intensive nature of our gas
    distribution business; increased competition from energy
    suppliers and alternative forms of energy; the inherent hazards
    and risks involved in operating our gas distribution business,
    natural disasters, terrorist activities or other events, and
    other risks and uncertainties discussed herein, all of which are
    difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.
    Accordingly, while we believe these forward-looking statements
    to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they will
    approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived
    from them will be realized. Further, we undertake no obligation
    to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements
    whether as a result of new information, future events or
    otherwise.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States. Preparation of these financial statements
    requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
    and the related disclosures of contingent assets and
    liabilities. We based our estimates on historical experience and
    various



other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
    circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates,
    including those related to risk management and trading
    activities, fair value measurements, allowance for doubtful
    accounts, legal and environmental accruals, insurance accruals,
    pension and postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes
    and valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets
    and other long-lived assets. Our critical accounting policies
    are reviewed by the Audit Committee periodically. Actual results
    may differ from estimates.

Regulation

— Our natural gas distribution and
    regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to
    regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of
    accounting records and various other matters by the respective
    regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. We
    meet the criteria established within accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of a cost-based,
    rate-regulated entity, which requires us to reflect the
    financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and
    policies of the various regulatory commissions in our financial
    statements in accordance with applicable authoritative
    accounting standards. We apply the provisions of this standard
    to our regulated operations and record regulatory assets for
    costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through
    customer rates is considered probable and regulatory liabilities
    when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts
    that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking
    process. As a result, certain costs that would normally be
    expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the
    balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered
    through rates. Discontinuing the application of this method of
    accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could
    significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs
    would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet,
    which could reduce our net income. Further, regulation may
    impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized.
    The amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon
    historical experience and our understanding of the regulations.
    The impact of regulation on our regulated operations may be
    affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the
    issuance of new regulations.

Revenue recognition

— Sales of natural gas to
    our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly
    basis; however, the billing cycle periods for certain classes of
    customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods
    used for financial reporting purposes. We follow the revenue
    accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution
    segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to
    customers, but not yet billed under the cycle billing method,
    are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to
    expense.

On occasion, we are permitted to implement new rates that have
    not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities, which
    are subject to refund. We recognize this revenue and establish a
    reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our
    experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were
    implemented.

Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for
    increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through
    purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas cost
    adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of
    recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without
    filing a rate case to address all of the utility company’s
    non-gas costs. These mechanisms are commonly utilized when
    regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of cost, such
    as purchased gas costs, that (i) is subject to significant
    price fluctuations compared to the utility company’s other
    costs, (ii) represents a large component of the utility
    company’s cost of service and (iii) is generally
    outside the control of the gas utility company. There is no
    gross profit generated through purchased gas cost adjustments,
    but they provide a

dollar-for-dollar

offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs. Although
    substantially all natural gas distribution sales to our
    customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase, our
    gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the
    cost of gas as a result of the purchased gas cost adjustment
    mechanism. The effects of these purchased gas cost adjustment
    mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance
    sheet.

Operating revenues for our regulated transmission and storage
    and nonregulated segments are recognized in the period in which
    actual volumes are transported and storage services are provided.

Operating revenues for our nonregulated segment and the
    associated carrying value of natural gas inventory (inclusive of
    storage costs) are recognized when we sell the gas and
    physically deliver it to our



customers. Operating revenues include realized gains and losses
    arising from the settlement of financial instruments used in our
    natural gas marketing activities and unrealized gains and losses
    arising from changes in the fair value of natural gas inventory
    designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge and the
    associated financial instruments.

Allowance for doubtful accounts

— Accounts
    receivable arise from natural gas sales to residential,
    commercial, industrial, municipal and other customers. For the
    majority of our receivables, we establish an allowance for
    doubtful accounts based on our collections experience. On
    certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific
    customer’s inability or reluctance to pay, we record an
    allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce
    the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to
    collect. However, if circumstances change, our estimate of the
    recoverability of accounts receivable could be affected.
    Circumstances which could affect our estimates include, but are
    not limited to, customer credit issues, the level of natural gas
    prices, customer deposits and general economic conditions.
    Accounts are written off once they are deemed to be
    uncollectible.

Financial instruments and hedging activities

— We currently use financial instruments to
    mitigate commodity price risk. Additionally, we periodically use
    financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. The
    objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have
    been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and
    nonregulated businesses.

We record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet
    at fair value as required by accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States

,

with changes in fair value
    ultimately recorded in the income statement. The timing of when
    changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recorded
    in the income statement depends on whether the financial
    instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a
    hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a
    different accounting treatment. Changes in fair value for
    financial instruments that do not meet one of these criteria are
    recognized in the income statement as they occur.

Financial
    Instruments Associated with Commodity Price Risk

In our natural gas distribution segment, our customers are
    exposed to the effect of volatile natural gas prices. We manage
    this exposure through a combination of physical storage,
    fixed-price forward contracts and financial instruments,
    primarily

over-the-counter

swap and option contracts, in an effort to minimize the impact
    of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the
    winter heating season. The costs associated with and the gains
    and losses arising from the use of financial instruments to
    mitigate commodity price risk in this segment are included in
    our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms in accordance with
    regulatory requirements. Therefore, changes in the fair value of
    these financial instruments are initially recorded as a
    component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the
    consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas
    cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and
    recognized in revenue in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, there is
    no earnings impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a
    result of the use of financial instruments.

Our nonregulated segment aggregates and purchases gas supply,
    arranges transportation

and/or

storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers
    at competitive prices. We also perform asset optimization
    activities in which we seek to maximize the economic value
    associated with storage and transportation capacity we own or
    control in both our natural gas distribution and nonregulated
    businesses. As a result of these activities, our nonregulated
    operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in the
    market price of natural gas. We manage our exposure to the risk
    of natural gas price changes through a combination of physical
    storage and financial instruments, including futures,

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with
    counterparties.

In our nonregulated segment, we have designated the natural gas
    inventory held by this operating segment as the hedged item in a
    fair-value hedge. This inventory is marked to market at the end
    of each month based on the Gas Daily index, with changes in fair
    value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the
    period of change. The financial instruments associated with this
    natural gas inventory have been designated as fair-value hedges
    and are marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price
    with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or
    losses in revenue in the period of change. Changes in the
    spreads



between the forward natural gas prices used to value the
    financial instruments designated against our physical inventory
    (NYMEX) and the market (spot) prices used to value our physical
    storage (Gas Daily) result in unrealized margins until the
    underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial
    instruments are settled. The difference in the spot price used
    to value our physical inventory and the forward price used to
    value the related financial instruments can result in volatility
    in our reported income as a component of unrealized margins. We
    have elected to exclude this spot/forward differential for
    purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fair-value
    hedges. Once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments
    are settled, the previously unrealized margins associated with
    these net positions are realized. Over time, we expect gains and
    losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be offset by
    gains and losses on the fair-value hedges, resulting in the
    realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated
    at the time we structured the original transaction.

We have elected to treat fixed-price forward contracts used in
    our nonregulated segment to deliver gas as normal purchases and
    normal sales. As such, these deliveries are recorded on an
    accrual basis in accordance with our revenue recognition policy.
    Financial instruments used to mitigate the commodity price risk
    associated with these contracts have been designated as cash
    flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at indexed
    prices. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses on open
    financial instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a
    component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold. Hedge
    ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred, is reported as a
    component of revenue.

We also use storage swaps and futures to capture additional
    storage arbitrage opportunities in our nonregulated segment that
    arise after the execution of the original fair value hedge
    associated with our physical natural gas inventory, basis swaps
    to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price
    and storage books and various

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options. These financial instruments have
    not been designated as hedges.

Financial
    Instruments Associated with Interest Rate Risk

We periodically manage interest rate risk, typically when we
    issue new or refinance existing long-term debt with Treasury
    lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the
    interest cost associated with anticipated financings. We
    designate these Treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges at
    the time the agreements are executed. Accordingly, unrealized
    gains and losses associated with the Treasury lock agreements
    are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss). The realized gain or loss recognized upon
    settlement of each Treasury lock agreement is initially recorded
    as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
    and is recognized as a component of interest expense over the
    life of the related financing arrangement. Hedge
    ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred, is reported as a
    component of interest expense.

Impairment assessments

— We perform impairment
    assessments of our goodwill, intangible assets subject to
    amortization and long-lived assets. As of September 30,
    2011, we had no indefinite-lived intangible assets.

We annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during
    our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise. We
    use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to
    estimate the fair value of our reporting units. We have
    determined our reporting units to be each of our natural gas
    distribution divisions and wholly-owned subsidiaries and
    goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the
    acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill. The discounted cash
    flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are
    dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of
    future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rate. An
    impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a
    reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value.

We annually assess whether the cost of our intangible assets
    subject to amortization or other long-lived assets is
    recoverable or that the remaining useful lives may warrant
    revision. We perform this assessment more frequently when
    specific events or circumstances have occurred that suggest the
    recoverability of the cost of the intangible and other
    long-lived assets is at risk.



When such events or circumstances are present, we assess the
    recoverability of these assets by determining whether the
    carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash
    flows from the operating division or subsidiary to which these
    assets relate. These cash flow projections consider various
    factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the
    discount rate and are based upon the best information available
    at the time the estimate is made. Changes in these factors could
    materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the
    recognition of an impairment charge. An impairment charge is
    recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the
    fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less
    than the carrying value of the related asset.

Pension and other postretirement plans

—
    Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are
    determined on an actuarial basis using a September 30
    measurement date and are affected by numerous assumptions and
    estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates
    of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates
    and current demographic and actuarial mortality data. The
    assumed discount rate and the expected return are the
    assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on
    our pension costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate,
    the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of
    retirement generally have the most significant impact on our
    postretirement plan costs and liabilities.

The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the
    actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement
    obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement benefit
    plan costs. When establishing our discount rate, we consider
    high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in
    the marketplace that are suitable for settling the obligations,
    changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied
    discount rate that is derived from matching our projected
    benefit disbursements with currently available high quality
    corporate bonds.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in
    calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our
    annual pension and postretirement plan costs. We estimate the
    expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond
    returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of
    active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset
    rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the
    guidance from our investment advisors in making a final
    determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the
    extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the
    course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate,
    that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan costs are
    not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases
    future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of
    approximately ten to twelve years.

The market-related value of our plan assets represents the fair
    market value of the plan assets, adjusted to smooth out
    short-term market fluctuations over a five-year period. The use
    of this calculation will delay the impact of current market
    fluctuations on the pension expense for the period.

We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in
    determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual
    health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted
    legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of
    retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our
    participant census information as of the measurement date.

Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and
    differences between the actual and expected return on plan
    assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension
    costs ultimately recognized. A 0.25 percent change in our
    discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs
    by approximately $1.9 million. A 0.25 percent change
    in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and
    postretirement costs by approximately $0.8 million.

Fair Value Measurements

— We report certain
    assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the
    price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
    transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants at the measurement date (exit price). We primarily
    use quoted market prices and other observable market pricing
    information in valuing our financial assets and liabilities and
    minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our
    measurements.

Prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to
    determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities
    recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. Within our
    nonregulated operations, we utilize a



mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point between the bid and
    ask prices) as a practical expedient for determining fair value
    measurement, as permitted under current accounting standards.
    Values derived from these sources reflect the market in which
    transactions involving these financial instruments are executed.
    We utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair
    value when external sources are not available. Values are
    adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly
    liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time
    under then-current market conditions. We believe the market
    prices and models used to value these assets and liabilities
    represent the best information available with respect to closing
    exchange and

over-the-counter

quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the
    assets and liabilities.

Fair-value estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and
    the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved. Our
    counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and
    major energy companies. This concentration of counterparties may
    materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from
    market, economic or regulatory conditions. Adverse developments
    in the global financial and credit markets in the last few years
    have made it more difficult and more expensive for companies to
    access the short-term capital markets, which may negatively
    impact the creditworthiness of our counterparties. A further
    tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our
    counterparties to fail to perform. We seek to minimize
    counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their
    financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral
    requirements under certain circumstances.

Amounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially
    significant volatility based upon changes in market prices, the
    valuation of the portfolio of our contracts, maturity and
    settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions,
    each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our
    financial instruments. We believe the market prices and models

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

Overview

Atmos Energy Corporation is involved in the distribution,
    marketing and transportation of natural gas. Accordingly, our
    results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural
    gas, particularly during the winter heating season, and the
    volatility of the natural gas markets. This generally results in
    higher operating revenues and net income during the period from
    October through March of each fiscal year and lower operating
    revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the
    period from April through September of each fiscal year. As a
    result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry, our
    second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical
    earnings quarter with an average of approximately
    62 percent of our consolidated net income having been
    earned in the second quarter during the three most recently
    completed fiscal years.

Additionally, the seasonality of our business impacts our
    working capital differently at various times during the year.
    Typically, our accounts receivable, accounts payable and
    short-term debt balances peak by the end of January and then
    start to decline, as customers begin to pay their winter heating
    bills. Gas stored underground, particularly in our natural gas
    distribution segment, typically peaks in November and declines
    as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers.

During fiscal 2011, we earned $207.6 million, or $2.27 per
    diluted share, which represents a one percent increase in net
    income and a three percent increase in diluted net income per
    share over fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2011, recent improvements
    in rate designs in our natural gas distribution segment and a
    successful regulatory outcome in our regulated transmission and
    storage segment offset a seven percent

year-over-year

decline in consolidated natural gas distribution throughput due
    to warmer weather and a 108 percent decrease in asset
    optimization margins as a result of weak natural gas market
    fundamentals. Results for fiscal 2011 were influenced by several
    non-recurring items, which increased diluted earnings per share
    by $0.03. The increase in fiscal 2011 earnings per share also
    reflects the favorable impact of our accelerated share buyback



agreement initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and
    completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, which increased
    diluted earnings per share by $0.08.

On May 12, 2011, we entered into a definitive agreement to
    sell all of our natural gas distribution assets located in
    Missouri, Illinois and Iowa to Liberty Energy (Midstates)
    Corporation, an affiliate of Algonquin Power &
    Utilities Corp. for a cash price of approximately
    $124 million. The agreement contains terms and conditions
    customary for transactions of this type, including typical
    adjustments to the purchase price at closing, if applicable. The
    closing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of
    customary conditions including the receipt of applicable
    regulatory approvals. Due to the pending sales transaction, the
    results of operations for these three service areas are shown in
    discontinued operations.

On June 10, 2011 we issued $400 million of
    5.50% senior notes. The effective interest rate on these
    notes is 5.381 percent, after giving effect to offering
    costs and the settlement of the $300 million Treasury locks
    associated with the offering. Substantially all of the net
    proceeds of approximately $394 million were used to repay
    $350 million of outstanding commercial paper. The remainder
    of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes. The
    Treasury locks were settled on June 7, 2011 with the
    receipt of $20.1 million from the counterparties due to an
    increase in the

30-year

Treasury lock rates between inception of the Treasury locks and
    settlement. Because the Treasury locks were effective, the net
    $12.6 million unrealized gain was recorded as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized
    as a component of interest expense over the

30-year

life
    of the senior notes.

During the year ended September 30, 2011, we executed on
    our strategy to streamline our credit facilities, as follows:

•

On May 2, 2011, we replaced our five-year
    $566.7 million unsecured credit facility, due to expire in
    December 2011, with a five-year $750 million unsecured
    credit facility with an accordion feature that could increase
    our borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion.

•

In December 2010, we replaced AEM’s $450 million

364-day

facility with a $200 million, three-year facility. The
    reduced amount of the new facility is due to the current low
    cost of gas and AEM’s ability to access an intercompany
    facility that was increased in fiscal 2011; however, this
    facility contains an accordion feature that could increase our
    borrowing capacity to $500 million.

•

In October 2010, we replaced our $200 million

364-day

revolving credit agreement with a $200 million

180-day

revolving credit agreement that expired in April 2011. As
    planned, we did not replace or extend this agreement.

After giving effect to these changes, we now have
    $985 million of liquidity available to us from our
    commercial paper program and four committed credit facilities
    and have reduced our financing costs. We believe this
    availability provides sufficient liquidity to fund our working
    capital needs.

We reported net income of $207.6 million, or $2.27 per
    diluted share for the year ended September 30, 2011,
    compared with net income of $205.8 million or $2.20 per
    diluted share in the prior year. Income from continuing
    operations was $198.9 million, or $2.17 per diluted share
    compared with $198.3 million, or $2.12 per diluted share in
    the prior-year period. Income from discontinued operations was
    $8.7 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the year,
    compared with $7.6 million or $0.08 per diluted share in
    the prior year. Unrealized losses in our nonregulated operations
    during the current year reduced net income by $6.6 million
    or $0.07 per diluted share compared with net losses recorded in
    the prior year of $4.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share.
    Additionally, net income in both periods was impacted by
    nonrecurring items. In the prior year, net income included the
    net positive impact of a state sales tax refund of
    $4.6 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. In the current
    year, net income includes the net positive impact of several
    one-time items totaling $3.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted
    share related to the following pre-tax amounts:

•

$27.8 million favorable impact related to the cash gain
    recorded in association with the unwinding of two Treasury locks
    in conjunction with the cancellation of a planned debt offering
    in November 2011.

•

$30.3 million unfavorable impact related to the non-cash
    impairment of certain assets in our nonregulated business.

•

$5.0 million favorable impact related to the administrative
    settlement of various income tax positions.

Net income during fiscal 2010 increased eight percent over
    fiscal 2009. Net income from our regulated operations increased
    six percent during fiscal 2010. The increase primarily reflects
    colder than normal weather in most of our service areas during
    fiscal 2010 as well as the net favorable impact of various
    ratemaking activities in our natural gas distribution segment.
    Net income in our nonregulated operations increased
    $5.3 million during fiscal 2010 primarily due to the impact
    of unrealized margins. Non-cash, net unrealized losses totaled
    $4.3 million which reduced earnings per share by $0.05 per
    diluted share in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, when net
    unrealized losses totaled $21.6 million, which reduced
    earnings per share by $0.23 per diluted share.

See the following discussion regarding the results of operations
    for each of our business operating segments.

Natural
    Gas Distribution Segment

The primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas
    distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized
    rates of return, the cost of natural gas, competitive factors in
    the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas.

Our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on
    our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking
    jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and,
    ultimately, separating the recovery of our approved margins from
    customer usage patterns. Improving rate design is a long-term
    process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate
    in multiple rate jurisdictions. The “Ratemaking
    Activity” section of this

Form 10-K

describes our current rate strategy, progress towards
    implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in
    more detail.

We are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our
    customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment
    mechanisms; therefore the cost of gas typically does not have an
    impact on our gross profit as increases in the cost of gas are
    offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. Accordingly, we
    believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial
    performance than revenues. However, gross profit in our Texas
    and Mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross
    receipts taxes, which are calculated as a percentage of revenue
    (inclusive of gas costs). Therefore, the amount of these taxes
    included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the
    level of gas sales volumes. We record the tax expense as a
    component of taxes, other than income. Although changes in
    revenue-related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect
    gross profit, over time the impact is offset within operating
    income.

As discussed above, the cost of gas typically does not have a
    direct impact on our gross profit. However, higher gas costs may
    adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting
    in higher bad debt



expense, and may require us to increase borrowings under our
    credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. In
    addition, higher gas costs, as well as competitive factors in
    the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers
    to conserve or, in the case of industrial consumers, to use
    alternative energy sources. However, gas cost risk has been
    mitigated in recent years through improvements in rate design
    that allow us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion
    of our bad debt expense on approximately 73 percent of our
    residential and commercial margins.

In May 2011, we announced that we had entered into a definitive
    agreement to sell our natural gas distribution operations in
    Missouri, Illinois and Iowa. The results of these operations
    have been separately reported in the following tables and
    exclude general corporate overhead and interest expense that
    would normally be allocated to these operations.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2011 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2010

The $22.4 million increase in natural gas distribution
    gross profit primarily reflects a $40.4 million net
    increase in rate adjustments, primarily in the Mid-Tex,
    Louisiana, Kentucky and Kansas service areas.

These increases were partially offset by:

•

$12.0 million decrease due to a seven percent decrease in
    consolidated throughput caused principally by lower residential
    and commercial consumption combined with warmer weather this
    fiscal year compared to the same period last year in most of our
    service areas.

•

$8.1 million decrease in revenue-related taxes, primarily
    due to lower revenues on which the tax is calculated.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
    expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
    amortization expense and taxes, other than income decreased
    $5.5 million, primarily due to the following:

•

$10.0 million decrease in taxes, other than income, due to
    lower revenue-related taxes.

•

$6.4 million decrease in employee-related expenses.

These decreases were partially offset by:

•

$5.4 million increase due to the absence of a state sales
    tax reimbursement received in the prior year.

•

$11.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization
    expense.

•

$1.8 million increase in vehicles and equipment expense.

Net income for this segment for the

year-to-date

period was also favorably impacted by a $21.8 million
    pre-tax gain recognized in March 2011 as a result of unwinding
    two Treasury locks and a $5.0 million income tax benefit
    related to the administrative settlement of various income tax
    positions.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2010 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2009

The $24.4 million increase in natural gas distribution
    gross profit primarily reflects rate adjustments and increased
    throughput as follows:

•

$33.4 million net increase in rate adjustments, primarily
    in the West Texas, Mid-Tex, Louisiana, Kentucky, Tennessee,
    Virginia and Mississippi service areas.



•

$10.6 million increase as a result of an 11 percent
    increase in consolidated throughput primarily associated with
    higher residential and commercial consumption and colder weather
    in most of our service areas.

These increases were partially offset by:

•

$7.6 million decrease due to a non-recurring adjustment
    recorded in the prior-year period to update the estimate for gas
    delivered to customers but not yet billed to reflect base rate
    changes.

•

$7.0 million decrease related to a prior-year reversal of
    an accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs that did not
    recur in the current year.

•

$1.6 million decrease in revenue-related taxes, primarily
    due to a decrease in revenues on which the tax is calculated.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
    expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
    amortization expense, taxes, other than income and asset
    impairments decreased $7.8 million, primarily due to the
    following:

•

$5.4 million decrease due to a state sales tax
    reimbursement received in March 2010.

•

$4.6 million decrease due to the absence of an impairment
    charge for

available-for-sale

securities recorded in the prior year.

•

$4.5 million decrease in contract labor expenses.

•

$4.6 million decrease in travel, legal and other
    administrative costs.

These decreases were partially offset by:

•

$7.5 million increase in employee-related expenses.

•

$4.5 million increase in taxes, other than income.

Miscellaneous income decreased $4.4 million due to lower
    interest income. Interest charges decreased $5.5 million
    primarily due to lower short-term debt balances and interest
    rates.

Additionally, results for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2009, were favorably impacted by a one-time
    tax benefit of $10.5 million. During the second quarter of
    fiscal 2009, the Company completed a study of the calculations
    used to estimate its deferred tax rate, and concluded that
    revisions to these calculations to include more specific
    jurisdictional tax rates would result in a more accurate
    calculation of the tax rate at which deferred taxes would
    reverse in the future. Accordingly, the Company modified the tax
    rate used to calculate deferred taxes from 38 percent to an
    individual rate for each legal entity. These rates vary from

36-41 percent

depending on the jurisdiction of the legal entity.

Regulated
    Transmission and Storage Segment

Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the
    regulated pipeline and storage operations of the Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division. The Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division transports natural gas to
    our Mid-Tex Division and third parties and manages five
    underground storage reservoirs in Texas. We also provide
    ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including
    parking arrangements, lending and sales of excess gas.

Similar to our natural gas distribution segment, our regulated
    transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather
    patterns, competitive factors in the energy industry and
    economic conditions in our Mid-Tex service area. Natural gas
    prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as
    revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas.
    However, natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could
    influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we
    serve, which may influence the level of throughput we may be
    able to transport on our pipeline. Further, natural gas price
    differences between the various hubs that we serve could
    influence customers to transport gas through our pipeline to
    capture arbitrage gains.



The results of Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division are
    also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of
    the Mid-Tex Division because it is the primary supplier of
    natural gas for our Mid-Tex Division.

Finally, as a regulated pipeline, the operations of the Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division may be impacted by the
    timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these
    costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs.

    Financial and Operating Results

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2011 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2010

On April 18, 2011, the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC)
    issued an order in the rate case of Atmos Pipeline —
    Texas (APT) that was originally filed in September 2010. The RRC
    approved an annual operating income increase of
    $20.4 million as well as the following major provisions
    that went into effect with bills rendered on and after
    May 1, 2011:

•

Authorized return on equity of 11.8 percent.

•

A capital structure of 49.5 percent debt/50.5 percent
    equity

•

Approval of a rate base of $807.7 million, compared to the
    $417.1 million rate base from the prior rate case.

•

An annual adjustment mechanism, which was approved for a
    three-year pilot program, that will adjust regulated rates up or
    down by 75 percent of the difference between APT’s
    non-regulated annual revenue and a pre-defined base credit.

•

Approval of a straight fixed variable rate design, under which
    all fixed costs associated with transportation and storage
    services are recovered through monthly customer charges.



The $16.4 million increase in regulated transmission and
    storage gross profit was attributable primarily to the following:

•

$23.4 million net increase as a result of the rate case
    that was finalized and became effective in May 2011.

•

$3.2 million increase associated with our most recent GRIP
    filing.

These increases were partially offset by the following:

•

$4.8 million decrease due to the absence of the sale of
    excess gas, which occurred in the prior year.

•

$4.4 million decrease due to a decline in throughput to our
    Mid-Tex Division primarily due to warmer than normal weather
    during fiscal 2011.

Operating expenses increased $5.1 million primarily due to
    the following:

•

$4.6 million increase due to higher depreciation expense.

•

$2.0 million increase due to the absence of a state sales
    tax reimbursement received in the prior year.

These increases were partially offset by the following:

•

$0.8 million decrease related to lower levels of pipeline
    maintenance activities.

•

$0.7 million decrease due to lower employee-related
    expenses.

Miscellaneous income includes a $6.0 million gain
    recognized in March 2011 as a result of unwinding two Treasury
    locks.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2010 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2009

The $6.6 million decrease in regulated transmission and
    storage gross profit was attributable primarily to the following
    factors:

•

$13.3 million decrease due to lower transportation fees on
    through-system deliveries due to narrower basis spreads.

•

$2.6 million decrease due to decreased through-system
    volumes primarily associated with market conditions that
    resulted in reduced wellhead production, decreased drilling
    activity and increased competition, partially offset by
    increased deliveries to our Mid-Tex Division.

•

$1.6 million net decrease in market-based demand fees,
    priority reservation fees and compression activity associated
    with lower throughput.

These decreases were partially offset by the following:

•

$9.3 million increase associated with our GRIP filings.

•

$2.0 million increase of excess inventory sales in the
    current-year period.

Operating expenses decreased $10.5 million primarily due to:

•

$11.8 million decrease related to reduced contract labor.

•

$2.0 million decrease due to a state sales tax
    reimbursement received in March 2010.

These decreases were partially offset by a $2.1 million
    increase in taxes, other than income due to higher ad valorem
    and payroll taxes.

Miscellaneous income decreased $1.3 million due primarily
    to a decline in intercompany interest income.



Nonregulated
    Segment

Our nonregulated activities are conducted through Atmos Energy
    Holdings, Inc. (AEH), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Atmos Energy Corporation and operates primarily in the Midwest
    and Southeast areas of the United States.

AEH’s primary business is to deliver gas and provide
    related services by aggregating and purchasing gas supply,
    arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately
    delivering gas to customers at competitive prices. In addition,
    AEH utilizes proprietary and customer-owned transportation and
    storage assets to provide various delivered gas services our
    customers request, including furnishing natural gas supplies at
    fixed and market-based prices, contract negotiation and
    administration, load forecasting, gas storage acquisition and
    management services, transportation services, peaking sales and
    balancing services, capacity utilization strategies and gas
    price hedging through the use of financial instruments. As a
    result, AEH’s gas delivery and related services margins
    arise from the types of commercial transactions we have
    structured with our customers and our ability to identify the
    lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies,
    transportation and markets to which it has access to serve those
    customers.

AEH’s storage and transportation margins arise from
    (i) utilizing its proprietary

21-mile

pipeline located in New Orleans, Louisiana to aggregate gas
    supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in
    Louisiana, its gas delivery activities and, on a more limited
    basis, for third parties and (ii) managing proprietary
    storage in Kentucky and Louisiana to supplement the natural gas
    needs of our natural gas distribution divisions during peak
    periods.

AEH also seeks to enhance its gross profit margin by maximizing,
    through asset optimization activities, the economic value
    associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns
    or controls in our natural gas distribution and by its
    subsidiaries. We attempt to meet these objectives by engaging in
    natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and
    profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various
    locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over
    time. This process involves purchasing physical natural gas,
    storing it in the storage and transportation assets to which AEH
    has access and selling financial instruments at advantageous
    prices to lock in a gross profit margin.

AEH continually manages its net physical position to attempt to
    increase the future economic profit that was created when the
    original transaction was executed. Therefore, AEH may
    subsequently change its originally scheduled storage injection
    and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on
    market conditions. If AEH elects to accelerate the withdrawal of
    physical gas, it will execute new financial instruments to
    offset the original financial instruments. If AEH elects to
    defer the withdrawal of gas, it will execute new financial
    instruments to correspond to the revised withdrawal schedule and
    allow the original financial instrument to settle as contracted.

We use financial instruments, designated as fair value hedges,
    to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our natural gas
    marketing storage activities. These financial instruments are
    marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with
    changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses
    in the period of change. The hedged natural gas inventory is
    marked to market at the end of each month based on the Gas Daily
    index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains
    and losses in the period of change. Changes in the spreads
    between the forward natural gas prices used to value the
    financial hedges designated against our physical inventory and
    the market (spot) prices used to value our physical storage
    result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas
    is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled.
    Once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are
    settled, the previously unrealized margins associated with these
    net positions are realized.

AEH also uses financial instruments to capture additional
    storage arbitrage opportunities that may arise after the
    original physical inventory hedge and to attempt to insulate and
    protect the economic value within its asset optimization
    activities. Changes in fair value associated with these
    financial instruments are recognized as a component of
    unrealized margins until they are settled.

Due to the nature of these operations, natural gas prices and
    differences in natural gas prices between the various markets
    that we serve (commonly referred to as basis differentials),
    have a significant impact on our



nonregulated businesses. Within our delivered gas activities,
    basis differentials impact our ability to create value from
    identifying the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas
    supplies, transportation and markets to which we have access.
    Further, higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our
    accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt
    expense, and may require us to increase borrowings under our
    credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. Higher
    gas prices, as well as competitive factors in the industry and
    general economic conditions may also cause customers to conserve
    or use alternative energy sources. Within our asset optimization
    activities, higher gas prices could also lead to increased
    borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher
    interest expense.

Volatility in natural gas prices also has a significant impact
    on our nonregulated segment. Increased price volatility often
    has a significant impact on the spreads between the market
    (spot) prices and forward natural gas prices, which creates
    opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads within our asset
    optimization activities. Volatility could also impact the basis
    differentials we capture in our delivered gas activities.
    However, increased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized
    margins recorded in our gross profit and could cause an increase
    in the amount of cash required to collateralize our risk
    management liabilities.

Review of
    Financial and Operating Results

Financial and operational highlights for our nonregulated
    segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010
    and 2009 are presented below. Gross profit margin consists
    primarily of margins earned from the delivery of gas and related
    services requested by our customers, margins earned from storage
    and transportation services and margins earned from asset
    optimization activities, which are derived from the utilization
    of our proprietary and managed third-party storage and
    transportation assets to capture favorable arbitrage spreads
    through natural gas trading activities.

Unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses on
    our net physical gas position and the related financial
    instruments used to manage commodity price risk as described
    above. These margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads
    between the physical and forward natural gas prices. Generally,
    if the physical/financial spread narrows, we will record
    unrealized gains or lower unrealized losses. If the
    physical/financial spread widens, we will record unrealized
    losses or lower unrealized gains. The magnitude of the
    unrealized gains and losses is also contingent upon the levels
    of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2011 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2010

Realized margins for gas delivery, storage and transportation
    services and other services were $78.8 million during the
    year ended September 30, 2011 compared with
    $78.1 million for the prior-year period. The increase
    primarily reflects the following:

•

$1.4 million increase in margins from storage and
    transportation services, primarily attributable to new drilling
    projects in the Barnett Shale area.

•

$0.6 million decrease in gas delivery and other services
    primarily due to lower

per-unit

margins partially offset by a nine percent increase in
    consolidated delivered gas sales volumes due to new customers in
    the power generation market.

Per-unit

margins were $0.13/Mcf in the current year compared with
    $0.14/Mcf in the prior year. The

year-over-year

decrease in

per-unit

margins reflects the impact of increased competition and lower
    basis spreads.

The $47.2 million decrease in realized asset optimization
    margins from the prior year primarily reflects the unfavorable
    impact of weak natural gas market fundamentals which provided
    fewer favorable trading opportunities.



Unrealized margins decreased $2.6 million in the current
    period compared to the prior-year period primarily due to the
    timing of

year-over-year

realized margins.

Operating expenses decreased $5.0 million primarily due to
    lower employee-related expenses and ad valorem taxes.

During fiscal 2011, our nonregulated segment recognized
    $30.3 million of non-cash asset impairment charges
    associated with two projects. In March 2011, we recorded a
    $19.3 million charge to substantially write off our
    investment in Fort Necessity. This project began in
    February 2008 when Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC, a subsidiary
    of AEH, announced plans to construct and operate a salt-cavern
    storage project in Franklin Parish, Louisiana. In March 2010, we
    entered into an option and acquisition agreement with a third
    party, which provided the third party with the exclusive option
    to develop the proposed Fort Necessity salt-dome natural
    gas storage project. In July 2010, we agreed with the third
    party to extend the option period to March 2011. In January
    2011, the third party developer notified us that it did not plan
    to commence the activities required to allow it to exercise the
    option by March 2011; accordingly, the option was terminated. At
    that time, we evaluated our strategic alternatives and concluded
    the project’s returns did not meet our investment
    objectives. Additionally, during the third quarter of fiscal
    2011, we recorded an $11.0 million non-cash charge to
    impair certain natural gas gathering assets of Atmos Gathering
    Company. The charge reflected a reduction in the value of the
    project due to the current low natural gas price environment and
    the adverse impact of an ongoing lawsuit associated with the
    project.

Interest charges decreased $6.6 million primarily due to a
    decrease in intercompany borrowings.

Asset
    Optimization Activities

AEH monitors the impact of its asset optimization efforts by
    estimating the gross profit, before related fees, that it
    captured through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas
    and the execution of the associated financial instruments. This
    economic value, combined with the effect of the future reversal
    of unrealized gains or losses currently recognized in the income
    statement and related fees is referred to as the potential gross
    profit.

We define potential gross profit as the change in AEH’s
    gross profit in future periods if its optimization efforts are
    executed as planned. This amount does not include other
    operating expenses and associated income taxes that will be
    incurred to realize this amount. Therefore, it does not
    represent an estimated increase in future net income. There is
    no assurance that the economic value or the potential gross
    profit will be fully realized in the future.

We consider this measure a non-GAAP financial measure as it is
    calculated using both forward-looking storage
    injection/withdrawal and hedge settlement estimates and
    historical financial information. This measure is presented
    because we believe it provides a more comprehensive view to
    investors of our asset optimization efforts and thus a better
    understanding of these activities than would be presented by
    GAAP measures alone. Because there is no assurance that the
    economic value or potential gross profit will be realized in the
    future, corresponding future GAAP amounts are not available.



The following table presents AEH’s economic value and its
    potential gross profit (loss) at September 30, 2011 and
    2010.

Related fees represent the contractual costs to acquire the
    storage capacity utilized in our nonregulated segment’s
    asset optimization operations. The fees primarily consist of
    demand fees and contractual obligations to sell gas below market
    index in exchange for the right to manage and optimize third
    party storage assets for the positions we have entered into as
    of September 30, 2011 and 2010.

During the 2011 fiscal year, our nonregulated segment’s
    economic value increased from a negative economic value of
    ($7.5) million, or ($0.48)/Mcf at September 30, 2010
    to $4.9 million, or $0.23/Mcf at September 30, 2011.

The increase in economic value was attributable to several
    factors including an increase in the captured spread value
    resulting from realizing financial instruments with lower spread
    values, entering into financial hedges with higher average
    prices and rolling financial instruments to forward periods to
    capture incremental value. Additionally, as a result of falling
    gas prices throughout the year, we injected a net 5.3 Bcf,
    which reduced the overall weighted average cost of gas held in
    storage.

The economic value is based upon planned storage injection and
    withdrawal schedules and its realization is contingent upon the
    execution of this plan, weather and other execution factors.
    Since AEH actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to
    attempt to enhance the future profitability of its storage
    position, it may change its scheduled storage injection and
    withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market
    conditions. Therefore, we cannot ensure that the economic value
    or the potential gross profit as of September 30, 2011 will
    be fully realized in the future nor can we predict in what time
    periods such realization may occur. Further, if we experience
    operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally
    manage our stored gas positions, our earnings could be adversely
    impacted.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2010 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2009

Realized margins for gas delivery, storage and transportation
    services and other services contributed 64 percent to total
    realized margins during fiscal 2010, with asset optimization
    activities contributing the remaining 36 percent. In fiscal
    2009, gas delivery, storage and transportation services and
    other services represented 65 percent of the nonregulated
    segment’s realized margins with asset optimization
    contributing the remaining 35 percent. The
    $28.1 million decrease in realized gross profit reflected:

•

$19.4 million decrease in gas delivery, storage and
    transportation services and other services as a result of
    narrowing basis spreads, combined with lower delivered sales
    volumes.

Per-unit

delivered gas margins were $0.14/Mcf in fiscal 2010, compared
    with $0.17/Mcf in fiscal 2009, while delivered gas volumes were
    5 percent lower in fiscal 2010 when compared with fiscal
    2009.

•

$8.7 million decrease in asset optimization due to lower
    margins earned on storage optimization activities, lower basis
    gains earned from utilizing leased capacity and lower margins
    earned on asset management plans, partially offset by higher
    realized storage and trading gains during fiscal 2010.



The decrease in realized gross profit was offset by a
    $28.1 million increase in unrealized margins due to the

period-over-period

timing of storage withdrawal gains and the associated reversal
    of unrealized gains into realized gains.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
    expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
    amortization expense, taxes, other than income taxes, and asset
    impairments decreased $5.1 million primarily due a decrease
    in employee and other administrative costs, partially offset by
    an increase in gas gathering activities.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital
    expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of
    sources, including internally generated funds and borrowings
    under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities.
    Additionally, we have various uncommitted trade credit lines
    with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas
    on a monthly basis. Finally, from time to time, we raise funds
    from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our
    liquidity needs.

We regularly evaluate our funding strategy and profile to ensure
    that we have sufficient liquidity for our short-term and
    long-term needs in a cost-effective manner. We also evaluate the
    levels of committed borrowing capacity that we require. During
    fiscal 2011, we executed on our strategy of consolidating our
    short-term facilities used for our regulated operations into a
    single line of credit, including the following:

•

On May 2, 2011, we replaced our five-year
    $566.7 million unsecured credit facility, due to expire in
    December 2011, with a five-year $750 million unsecured
    credit facility with an accordion feature that could increase
    our borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion.

•

In December 2010, we replaced AEM’s $450 million

364-day

facility with a $200 million, three-year facility. The
    reduced amount of the new facility is due to the current low
    cost of gas and AEM’s ability to access an intercompany
    facility that was increased during fiscal 2011; however, this
    facility contains an accordion feature that could increase our
    borrowing capacity to $500 million.

•

In October 2010, we replaced our $200 million

364-day

revolving credit agreement with a $200 million

180-day

revolving credit agreement that expired in April 2011. As
    planned, we did not replace or extend this agreement.

As a result of these changes, we now have $985 million of
    availability from our commercial paper program and four
    committed revolving credit facilities with third parties.

Our $350 million 7.375% senior notes were paid on
    their maturity date on May 15, 2011 using commercial paper
    borrowings. In effect, we refinanced this debt on a long-term
    basis through the issuance of $400 million 5.50%

30-year

unsecured senior notes on June 10, 2011. On
    September 30, 2010, we entered into three Treasury lock
    agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest
    cost of financing the anticipated issuances of senior notes. The
    Treasury locks were settled on June 7, 2011 with the
    receipt of $20.1 million from the counterparties due to an
    increase in the

30-year

Treasury lock rates between inception of the Treasury lock and
    settlement. The effective interest rate on these notes is
    5.381 percent, after giving effect to offering costs and
    the settlement of the $300 million Treasury locks.
    Substantially all of the net proceeds of approximately
    $394 million were used to repay $350 million of
    outstanding commercial paper. The remainder of the net proceeds
    was used for general corporate purposes.

Additionally, we had planned to issue $250 million of

30-year

unsecured notes in November 2011 to fund our capital expenditure
    program. In September 2010, we entered into two Treasury lock
    agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest
    cost associated with the anticipated issuance of these senior
    notes, which were designated as cash flow hedges. Due primarily
    to stronger than anticipated cash flows primarily resulting from
    the extension of the Bush tax cuts that allow the continued use
    of bonus depreciation on qualifying expenditures through
    December 31, 2011, the need to issue $250 million of
    debt in November was eliminated and the related Treasury lock
    agreements were unwound. A pretax cash gain of approximately
    $28 million was recorded in March 2011.



Finally, we intend to refinance our $250 million unsecured
    5.125% Senior Notes that mature in January 2013 through the
    issuance of $350 million

30-year

unsecured notes. In August 2011, we entered into three Treasury
    lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the
    interest cost associated with the anticipated issuances of these
    senior notes. We designated all of these Treasury locks as cash
    flow hedges.

We believe the liquidity provided by our senior notes and
    committed credit facilities, combined with our operating cash
    flows, will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and
    capital expenditure program for fiscal year 2012.

Cash
    Flows

Our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a
    number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These
    include regulatory changes, the price for our services, the
    demand for such products and services, margin requirements
    resulting from significant changes in commodity prices,
    operational risks and other factors.

Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities
    for the years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are

Cash
    flows from operating activities

Year-over-year

changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable
    to changes in net income, working capital changes, particularly
    within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the
    price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections,
    payments for natural gas purchases and purchased gas cost
    recoveries. The significant factors impacting our operating cash
    flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below.

Fiscal
    Year ended September 30, 2011 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2010

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, we generated
    operating cash flow of $582.8 million from operating
    activities compared with $726.5 million in the prior year.
    The

year-over-year

decrease reflects the absence of an $85 million income tax
    refund received in the prior year coupled with the timing of gas
    cost recoveries under our purchased gas cost mechanisms and
    other net working capital changes.

Fiscal
    Year ended September 30, 2010 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2009

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we generated
    operating cash flow of $726.5 million from operating
    activities compared with $919.2 million in fiscal 2009,
    primarily due to the fluctuation in gas costs. Gas costs, which
    reached historically high levels during the 2008 injection
    season, declined sharply when the economy slipped into the
    recession and have remained relatively stable since that time.
    Operating cash flows for the fiscal 2010 period reflect the
    recovery of lower gas costs through purchased gas recovery
    mechanisms



and sales. This is in contrast to the fiscal 2009 period, where
    operating cash flows were favorably influenced by the recovery
    of high gas costs during a period of falling prices.

Cash
    flows from investing activities

In recent fiscal years, a substantial portion of our cash
    resources has been used to fund our ongoing construction program
    and improvements to information technology systems. Our ongoing
    construction program enables us to provide safe and reliable
    natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base,
    expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets,
    enhance the integrity of our pipelines and, more recently,
    expand our intrastate pipeline network. In executing our current
    rate strategy, we are focusing our capital spending in
    jurisdictions that permit us to earn an adequate return timely
    on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability
    of our system. Currently, our Mid-Tex, Louisiana, Mississippi
    and West Texas natural gas distribution divisions and our Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division have rate designs that
    provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved
    capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file
    a rate case.

In early fiscal 2010, two coalitions of cities, representing the
    majority of the cities our Mid-Tex Division serves, agreed to a
    program of installing, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal
    2011, 100,000 steel service line replacements during fiscal 2011
    and 2012, with approved recovery of the associated return,
    depreciation and taxes. During fiscal 2011, we replaced 35,852
    lines for a cost of $49.7 million. The program is
    progressing on schedule for completion in September 2012. As a
    result of this project and spending to replace our regulated
    customer service systems and our nonregulated energy trading
    risk management system, we anticipate capital expenditures will
    remain elevated during the next fiscal year.

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, we incurred
    $623.0 million for capital expenditures compared with
    $542.6 million for the fiscal year ended September 30,
    2010 and $509.5 million for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2009.

The $80.4 million increase in capital expenditures in
    fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily reflects spending
    for the steel service line replacement program in the Mid-Tex
    Division, the development of new customer billing and
    information systems for our natural gas distribution and our
    nonregulated segments and the construction of a new customer
    contact center in Amarillo, Texas, partially offset by costs
    incurred in the prior fiscal year to relocate the company’s
    information technology data center.

The $33.1 million increase in capital expenditures in
    fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily reflects spending
    for the relocation of our information technology data center to
    a new facility, the construction of two service centers and the
    steel service line replacement program in our Mid-Tex Division.

Cash
    flows from financing activities

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, our financing
    activities generated $44.0 million in cash, while financing
    activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010
    used $163.0 million in cash compared with cash of
    $337.5 million used for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2009. Our significant financing activities
    for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and
    2009 are summarized as follows:


During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, we:

•

Received $394.5 million net cash proceeds in June 2011
    related to the issuance of $400 million 5.50% senior
    notes due 2041.

•

Borrowed a net $83.3 million under our short-term
    facilities to fund working capital needs.

•

Received $27.8 million cash in March 2011 related to the
    unwinding of two Treasury locks.

•

Received $20.1 million cash in June 2011 related to the
    settlement of three Treasury locks associated with the
    $400 million 5.50% senior notes offering.

•

Received $7.8 million net proceeds related to the issuance
    of 0.3 million shares of common stock.



•

Paid $360.1 million for scheduled long-term debt
    repayments, including our $350 million 7.375% senior
    notes that were paid on their maturity date on May 15, 2011.

•

Paid $124.0 million in cash dividends which reflected a
    payout ratio of 60 percent of net income.

•

Paid $5.3 million for the repurchase of equity awards.


During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we:

•

Paid $124.3 million in cash dividends which reflected a
    payout ratio of 61 percent of net income.

•

Paid $100.5 million for the repurchase of common stock
    under an accelerated share repurchase agreement.

•

Borrowed a net $54.3 million under our short-term
    facilities due to the impact of seasonal natural gas purchases.

•

Received $8.8 million net proceeds related to the issuance
    of 0.4 million shares of common stock, which is a
    68 percent decrease compared to the prior year due
    primarily to the fact that beginning in fiscal 2010 shares
    were purchased on the open market rather than being issued by us
    to the Direct Stock Purchase Plan and the Retirement Savings
    Plan.

•

Paid $1.2 million to repurchase equity awards.


During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, we:

•

Paid $407.4 million to repay our $400 million 4.00%
    unsecured notes.

•

Repaid a net $284.0 million short-term borrowings under our
    credit facilities.

•

Paid $121.5 million in cash dividends which reflected a
    payout ratio of 64 percent of net income.

•

Received $445.6 million in net proceeds related to the
    March 2009 issuance of $450 million of 8.50% Senior
    Notes due 2019. The net proceeds were used to repay the
    $400 million 4.00% unsecured notes.

•

Received $27.7 million net proceeds related to the issuance
    of 1.2 million shares of common stock.

•

Received $1.9 million net proceeds related to the
    settlement of the Treasury lock agreement associated with the
    March 2009 issuance of the $450 million of
    8.50% Senior Notes due 2019.

The following table shows the number of shares issued for the
    fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009:

The number of shares issued in fiscal 2011 compared with the
    number of shares issued in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects an
    increased number of shares issued under our 1998 Long-Term
    Incentive Plan due to the exercise of stock options during the
    current fiscal year. This increase was partially offset by the
    fact that we



are purchasing shares in the open market rather than issuing new
    shares for the Direct Stock Purchase Plan and the Retirement
    Savings Plan. During fiscal 2011, we cancelled and retired
    169,793 shares attributable to federal withholdings on
    equity awards and repurchased and retired 375,468 shares
    attributable to our 2010 accelerated share repurchase agreement
    described below, which are not included in the table above.

The

year-over-year

decrease in the number of shares issued in fiscal 2010 compared
    with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2009, primarily
    reflects the fact that in fiscal 2010, we began to purchase
    shares in the open market rather than issuing new shares for the
    Direct Stock Purchase Plan and the Retirement Savings Plan.
    Further, a higher average stock price during the second and
    third quarters of fiscal 2010 compared to the second and third
    quarters of 2009 enabled us to issue fewer shares during fiscal
    2010. Additionally, during fiscal 2010, we cancelled and retired
    37,365 shares attributable to federal withholdings on
    equity awards and repurchased and retired 2,958,580 common
    shares as part of our 2010 accelerated share repurchase
    agreement described below, which are not included in the table
    above.

Share
    Repurchase Agreement

On, July 1, 2010, we entered into an accelerated share
    repurchase agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. under
    which we repurchased $100 million of our outstanding common
    stock in order to offset stock grants made under our various
    employee and director incentive compensation plans.

We paid $100 million to Goldman Sachs & Co. on
    July 7, 2010 for shares of Atmos Energy common stock in a
    share forward transaction and received 2,958,580 shares. On
    March 4, 2011, we received and retired an additional
    375,468 common shares, which concluded our share repurchase
    agreement. In total, we received and retired 3,334,048 common
    shares under the repurchase agreement. The final number of
    shares we ultimately repurchased in the transaction was based
    generally on the average of the effective share repurchase price
    of our common stock over the duration of the agreement, which
    was $29.99. As a result of this transaction, beginning in our
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the number of outstanding shares
    used to calculate our earnings per share was reduced by the
    number of shares received and the $100 million purchase
    price was recorded as a reduction in shareholders’ equity.

Share
    Repurchase Program

On September 28, 2011 the Board of Directors approved a new
    program authorizing the repurchase of up to five million shares
    of common stock over a five-year period. Although the program is
    authorized for a five-year period, it may be terminated or
    limited at any time. Shares may be repurchased in the open
    market or in privately negotiated transactions in amounts the
    company deems appropriate. The program is primarily intended to
    minimize the dilutive effect of equity grants under various
    benefit related incentive compensation plans of the company.

Credit
    Facilities

Our short-term borrowing requirements are affected by the
    seasonal nature of the natural gas business. Changes in the
    price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to
    supply to meet our customers’ needs could significantly
    affect our borrowing requirements. However, our short-term
    borrowings typically reach their highest levels in the winter
    months.

As of September 30, 2011, we financed our short-term
    borrowing requirements through a combination of a
    $750.0 million commercial paper program and four committed
    revolving credit facilities with third-party lenders that
    provided $985 million of working capital funding. As of
    September 30, 2011, the amount available to us under our
    credit facilities, net of outstanding letters of credit, was
    $702.5 million. These facilities are described in further
    detail in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.

On May 2, 2011, we replaced our five-year
    $566.7 million unsecured credit facility, due to expire in
    December 2011, with a five-year $750 million unsecured
    credit facility with an accordion feature that could increase
    our borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion.



In December 2010, we replaced AEM’s $450 million

364-day

facility with a $200 million, three-year facility. The
    reduced amount of the new facility is due to the current low
    cost of gas and AEM’s ability to access an intercompany
    facility that was increased in fiscal 2011; however, this
    facility contains an accordion feature that could increase our
    borrowing capacity to $500 million.

In October 2010, we replaced our $200 million

364-day

revolving credit agreement with a $200 million

180-day

revolving credit agreement that expired in April 2011. As
    planned, we did not replace or extend this agreement.

Shelf
    Registration

We have an effective shelf registration statement with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that permits us to
    issue a total of $1.3 billion in common stock

and/or

debt
    securities. The shelf registration statement has been approved
    by all requisite state regulatory commissions. Due to certain
    restrictions imposed by one state regulatory commission on our
    ability to issue securities under the new registration
    statement, we were able to issue a total of $950 million in
    debt securities and $350 million in equity securities. At
    September 30, 2011, $900 million was available for
    issuance. Of this amount, $550 million is available for the
    issuance of debt securities and $350 million remains
    available for the issuance of equity securities under the shelf
    until March 2013.

Credit
    Ratings

Our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain
    short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the cost of
    such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating
    agencies consider a number of quantitative factors, including
    debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to
    outstanding debt, operating cash flow coverage of interest and
    pension liabilities and funding status. In addition, the rating
    agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our
    earnings over time, the quality of our management and business
    strategy, the risks associated with our regulated and
    nonregulated businesses and the regulatory environment in the
    states where we operate.

Our debt is rated by three rating agencies: Standard &
    Poor’s Corporation (S&P), Moody’s Investors
    Service (Moody’s) and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (Fitch). On
    May 11, 2011, Moody’s upgraded our senior unsecured
    debt rating to Baa1 from Baa2, with a ratings outlook of stable,
    citing steady rate increases, improving credit metrics and a
    strategic focus on lower risk regulated activities as reasons
    for the upgrade. On June 2, 2011, Fitch upgraded our senior
    unsecured debt rating to A- from BBB+, with a ratings outlook of
    stable, citing a constructive regulatory environment, strategic
    focus on lower risk regulated activities and the geographic
    diversity of our regulated operations as key rating factors. As
    of September 30, 2011, S&P maintained a stable
    outlook. Our current debt ratings are all considered investment
    grade and are as follows:

S&P

Moody’s

Fitch

Unsecured senior long-term debt

BBB+

Baa1

A-

Commercial paper

A-2

P-2

F-2

A significant degradation in our operating performance or a
    significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited
    access to the private and public credit markets as a result of
    deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions
    could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a
    reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating
    agencies. This would mean more limited access to the private and
    public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such
    borrowings.

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
    securities. The highest investment grade credit rating is AAA
    for S&P, Aaa for Moody’s and AAA for Fitch. The lowest
    investment grade credit rating is BBB-for S&P, Baa3 for
    Moody’s and BBB- for Fitch. Our credit ratings may be
    revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies, and
    each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
    rating. There can be no assurance that a rating will remain in
    effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be
    lowered, or withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its
    judgment, circumstances so warrant.



Debt
    Covenants

We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of
    September 30, 2011. Our debt covenants are described in
    Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.

Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, including

    September 30, 2011 and 2010. The increase in the debt to
    capitalization ratio primarily reflects an increase in
    short-term debt as of September 30, 2011 compared to the
    prior year. Our ratio of total debt to capitalization is
    typically greater during the winter heating season as we make
    additional short-term borrowings to fund natural gas purchases
    and meet our working capital requirements. We intend to continue
    to maintain our debt to capitalization ratio in a target range
    of 50 to 55 percent.

AEH has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural
    gas under contracts indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed
    price contracts. At September 30, 2011, AEH was committed
    to purchase 103.3 Bcf within one year, 46.4 Bcf within
    one to three years and 0.9 Bcf after three years under
    indexed contracts. AEH is committed to purchase 4.2 Bcf
    within one year and 0.3 Bcf within one to three years under
    fixed price contracts with prices ranging from $3.49 to $6.36
    per Mcf.

With the exception of our Mid-Tex Division, our natural gas
    distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several
    vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year.
    Commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under
    these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated
    prices. Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as
    necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the
    individual contract. Our Mid-Tex Division maintains long-term
    supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of natural gas for
    our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase
    specified volumes at market prices. The estimated commitments
    under these contract terms as of September 30, 2011 are
    reflected in the table above.

Risk
    Management Activities

We use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk
    and, periodically, to manage interest rate risk. We conduct risk
    management activities through our natural gas distribution and
    nonregulated segments. In our natural gas distribution segment,
    we use a combination of physical storage, fixed physical
    contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure
    to unusually large winter-period gas price increases. In our
    nonregulated segments, we manage our exposure to the risk of
    natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin
    through a combination of storage and financial instruments,
    including futures,

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with
    counterparties. To the extent our inventory cost and actual
    sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in
    the market indices we use in our hedges, we could experience
    ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting
    requirements for hedge accounting, resulting in the financial
    instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through
    earnings.

We use financial instruments, designated as cash flow hedges of
    anticipated purchases and sales at index prices, to mitigate the
    commodity price risk in our nonregulated segment associated with
    deliveries under fixed-priced forward contracts to deliver gas
    to customers, and we use financial instruments, designated as
    fair value hedges, to hedge our natural gas inventory used in
    our asset optimization activities in our nonregulated segment.

Also, in our nonregulated segment, we use storage swaps and
    futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities
    that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair
    value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory,
    basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our
    fixed price and storage books and various

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options. These financial instruments have
    not been designated as hedges.



We record our financial instruments as a component of risk
    management assets and liabilities, which are classified as
    current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date
    of the underlying financial instrument. Substantially all of our
    financial instruments are valued using external market quotes
    and indices.

Employee
    Benefit Programs

An important element of our total compensation program, and a
    significant component of our operation and maintenance expense,
    is the offering of various benefit programs to our employees.
    These programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and
    pension and postretirement programs.

Medical
    and Dental Insurance

We offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially
    all of our employees, and we believe these programs are
    consistent with other programs in our industry. Since 2005, we
    have experienced medical and prescription inflation of
    approximately seven percent. In recent years, we have strived to
    actively manage our health care costs through the introduction
    of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to
    identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved
    lifestyle choices.

In March 2010, President Obama signed

The Patient Protection
    and Affordable Care Act

into law (the “Health Care
    Reform Act”). The Health Care Reform Act will be phased in
    over an eight-year period. Although we are still assessing the
    impact of the Health Care Reform Act on the health care benefits
    we provide to our employees, the design of our health care plans
    has already changed in order to comply with provisions of the
    Health Care Reform Act that have already gone into effect or
    will be going into effect in fiscal 2012. For example, lifetime
    maximums on benefits have been eliminated, coverage for
    dependent children has been extended to age 26 and all
    costs of preventive coverage must be paid for by the insurer. In
    2014, health insurance exchanges will open in each state in
    order to provide a competitive marketplace for purchasing health
    insurance by individuals. Companies who offer health insurance
    to their employees could face a substantial increase in premiums
    at that time if they choose to continue to provide such
    coverage. However, companies who elect to cease providing health
    insurance to their employees will be faced with paying
    significant penalties to the federal government for each
    employee who receives coverage through an exchange. We will
    continue to monitor all developments on health care reform and
    continue to comply with all existing relevant laws and
    regulations.

For fiscal 2012, we anticipate an approximate 10 percent
    medical and prescription drug inflation rate, primarily due to
    anticipated higher claims costs and the implementation of the
    Health Care Reform Act.

Net
    Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit Costs

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, our total net
    periodic pension and other benefits costs was
    $56.6 million, compared with $50.8 million and
    $50.2 million for the fiscal years ended September 30,
    2010 and 2009. These costs relating to our natural gas
    distribution operations are recoverable through our gas
    distribution rates. A portion of these costs is capitalized into
    our gas distribution rate base, and the remaining costs are
    recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense.

Our fiscal 2011 costs were determined using a September 30,
    2010 measurement date. As of September 30, 2010, interest
    and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount
    rates were significantly higher than the interest and corporate
    bond rates as of September 30, 2009, the measurement date
    for our fiscal 2010 net periodic cost. Accordingly, we
    decreased our discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2011
    pension and benefit costs to 5.39 percent. Our expected
    return on our pension plan assets remained constant at
    8.25 percent. Accordingly, our fiscal 2011 pension and
    postretirement medical costs were higher than in the prior year.

The increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits
    costs during fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 primarily
    reflects the decline in fair value of our plan assets. The
    discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan’s
    liabilities generally is based on rates of high-grade corporate
    bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which
    the benefits will be paid. At our September 30, 2009
    measurement date, the interest rates were slightly lower than
    the interest rates at September 30, 2008, the measurement
    date used to determine our fiscal 2009 net periodic cost.
    Our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant
    at 8.25 percent.



Pension
    and Postretirement Plan Funding

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an
    amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to
    comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
    However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time
    to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to
    provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but
    also for those expected to be earned in the future.

In accordance with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), we
    determined the funded status of our plans as of January 1,
    2011. Based on this valuation, we were required to contribute
    cash of $0.9 million to our pension plans during fiscal
    2011. The need for this funding reflects the decline in the fair
    value of the plans’ assets resulting from the unfavorable
    market conditions experienced during 2008 and 2009. This
    contribution will increase the level of our plan assets to
    achieve a desirable PPA funding threshold.

During fiscal 2010, we did not contribute cash to our pension
    plans as the fair value of the plans’ assets recovered
    somewhat during the year from the unfavorable market conditions
    experienced in the latter half of calendar year 2008 and our
    plan assets were sufficient to achieve a desirable funding
    threshold as established by the PPA. During fiscal 2009, we
    contributed $21.0 million to our pension plans to achieve
    the same desired level of funding as established by the PPA.

We contributed $11.3 million, $11.8 million and
    $10.1 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the
    fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The
    contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs
    we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum
    funding required by state regulatory commissions.

Outlook
    for Fiscal 2012 and Beyond

As of September 30, 2011, interest and corporate bond rates
    utilized to determine our discount rates, which impacted our
    fiscal 2012 net periodic pension and postretirement costs,
    were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of
    September 30, 2010, the measurement date for our fiscal
    2011 net periodic cost. As a result of the lower interest
    and corporate bond rates, we decreased the discount rate used to
    determine our fiscal 2012 pension and benefit costs to
    5.05 percent. We reduced the expected return on our pension
    plan assets to 7.75 percent, based on historical experience
    and the current market projection of the target asset
    allocation. Although the fair value of our plan assets has
    declined as the financial markets have declined, the impact of
    this decline is partially mitigated by the fact that assets are
    smoothed for purposes of determining net periodic pension cost
    which results in asset gains and losses that are recognized over
    time as a component of net periodic pension and benefit costs
    for our Pension Account Plan, our largest funded plan. Due to
    the decrease in our discount rate and our expected return on
    plan assets as well as the decline in the fair value of our plan
    assets, we expect our fiscal 2012 pension and postretirement
    medical costs to increase compared to fiscal 2011.

Based upon market conditions subsequent to September 30,
    2011 the current funded position of the plans and the new
    funding requirements under the PPA, we anticipate contributing
    between $25 million and $30 million to the Plans in
    fiscal 2012. Further, we will consider whether an additional
    voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain PPA
    funding thresholds. With respect to our postretirement medical
    plans, we anticipate contributing approximately $32 million
    during fiscal 2012.

The projected pension liability, future funding requirements and
    the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the Plan
    are subject to change, depending upon the actuarial value of
    plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations
    as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date. These amounts
    are impacted by actual investment returns, changes in interest
    rates and changes in the demographic composition of the
    participants in the plan.

In August 2010, the Board of Directors of Atmos Energy approved
    a proposal to close the Pension Account Plan (PAP) to new
    participants, effective October 1, 2010. Employees
    participating in the PAP as of October 1, 2010 were allowed
    to make a one-time election to migrate from the PAP into our
    defined contribution plan with enhanced features, effective
    January 1, 2011. Participants who chose to remain in the
    PAP will continue to earn benefits and interest allocations with
    no changes to their existing benefits.



RECENT
    ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

Recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows are described in
    Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and
    interest rates. Commodity price risk is the potential loss that
    we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a
    particular instrument or commodity. Interest-rate risk results
    from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue
    to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities.

We conduct risk management activities through both our natural
    gas distribution and nonregulated segments. In our natural gas
    distribution segment, we use a combination of physical storage,
    fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to
    protect us and our customers against unusually large winter
    period gas price increases. In our nonregulated segment, we
    manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and
    lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage
    and financial instruments including futures,

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with
    counterparties. Our risk management activities and related
    accounting treatment are described in further detail in
    Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
    Additionally, our earnings are affected by changes in short-term
    interest rates as a result of our issuance of short-term
    commercial paper and our other short-term borrowings.

Commodity
    Price Risk

Natural
    gas distribution segment

We purchase natural gas for our natural gas distribution
    operations. Substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for
    natural gas distribution operations are recovered from our
    customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms.
    Therefore, our natural gas distribution operations have limited
    commodity price risk exposure.

Nonregulated
    segment

Our nonregulated segment is also exposed to risks associated
    with changes in the market price of natural gas. For our
    nonregulated segment, we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate
    commodity price risk. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate
    commodity price risk by applying a $0.50 change in the forward
    NYMEX price to our net open position (including existing storage
    and related financial contracts) at the end of each period.
    Based on AEH’s net open position (including existing
    storage and related financial contracts) at September 30,
    2011 of 0.1 Bcf, a $0.50 change in the forward NYMEX price
    would have had a $0.1 million impact on our consolidated
    net income.

Changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to
    market our physical inventory (Gas Daily) and the related
    fair-value hedge (NYMEX) can result in volatility in our
    reported net income; but, over time, gains and losses on the
    sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses
    on the fair-value hedges. Based upon our net physical position
    at September 30, 2011 and assuming our hedges would still
    qualify as highly effective, a $0.50 change in the difference
    between the Gas Daily and NYMEX indices would impact our
    reported net income by approximately $6.7 million.

Additionally, these changes could cause us to recognize a risk
    management liability, which would require us to place cash into
    an escrow account to collateralize this liability position.
    This, in turn, would reduce the amount of cash we would have on
    hand to fund our working capital needs.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our earnings are exposed to changes in short-term interest rates
    associated with our short-term commercial paper program and
    other short-term borrowings. We use a sensitivity analysis to
    estimate our short-term interest rate risk. For purposes of this
    analysis, we estimate our short-term interest rate risk as the
    difference between our actual interest expense for the period
    and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a
    hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates
    associated with our short-term borrowings. Had interest rates
    associated with our short-term borrowings increased by an
    average of one percent, our interest expense would have
    increased by approximately $1.2 million during 2011.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Atmos Energy Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Atmos Energy Corporation as of September 30, 2011 and 2010,
    and the related consolidated statements of income,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended September 30, 2011. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    Index at Item 8. These financial statements and schedule
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Atmos Energy Corporation at
    September 30, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results
    of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
    in the period ended September 30, 2011, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the financial statements taken as a
    whole, presents fairly, in all material respects the financial
    information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Atmos
    Energy Corporation’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of September 30, 2011, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated November 22, 2011
    expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Nature of
    Business

Atmos Energy Corporation (“Atmos Energy” or the
    “Company”) and our subsidiaries are engaged primarily
    in the regulated natural gas distribution and transmission and
    storage businesses as well as certain other nonregulated
    businesses. Through our natural gas distribution business, we
    deliver natural gas through sales and transportation
    arrangements to over three million residential, commercial,
    public-authority and industrial customers through our six
    regulated natural gas distribution divisions in the service
    areas described below:

Denotes locations where we have more limited service areas.

In addition, we transport natural gas for others through our
    distribution system. Our natural gas distribution business is
    subject to federal and state regulation

and/or

regulation by local authorities in each of the states in which
    our natural gas distribution divisions operate. Our corporate
    headquarters and shared-services function are located in Dallas,
    Texas, and our customer support centers are located in Amarillo
    and Waco, Texas.

In May 2011, we announced that we had entered into a definitive
    agreement to sell our natural gas distribution operations in
    Missouri, Illinois and Iowa, representing approximately 84,000
    customers. The results of these operations have been separately
    reported as discontinued operations.

Our regulated transmission and storage business consists of the
    regulated operations of our Atmos Pipeline — Texas
    Division, a division of the Company. This division transports
    natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division, transports natural gas for
    third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in
    Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary to the
    pipeline industry including parking arrangements, lending and
    sales of inventory on hand. Parking arrangements provide
    short-term interruptible storage of gas on our pipeline. Lending
    services provide short-term interruptible loans of natural gas
    from our pipeline to meet market demands.

Our nonregulated businesses operate primarily in the Midwest and
    Southeast through various wholly-owned subsidiaries of Atmos
    Energy Holdings, Inc., (AEH). AEH is wholly owned by the Company
    and based in Houston, Texas. Through AEH, we provide natural gas
    management and transportation services to municipalities,
    natural gas distribution companies, including certain divisions
    of Atmos Energy and third parties.

AEH’s primary business is to deliver gas and provide
    related services by aggregating and purchasing gas supply,
    arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately
    delivering gas to customers at competitive prices. In addition,
    AEH utilizes proprietary and customer-owned transportation and
    storage assets to provide various delivered gas services our
    customers request, including furnishing natural gas supplies at
    fixed and market-based prices, contract negotiation and
    administration, load forecasting, gas storage acquisition and
    management services, transportation services, peaking sales and
    balancing services, capacity utilization strategies and gas
    price hedging through the use of financial instruments. AEH also
    seeks to maximize, through asset optimization activities, the
    economic value associated with storage and transportation
    capacity it owns or controls. Certain of these arrangements are
    with regulated affiliates of the Company, which have been
    approved by applicable state regulatory commissions.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation

— The accompanying
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Atmos
    Energy Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
    material intercompany transactions have been eliminated;
    however, we have not eliminated intercompany profits when such
    amounts are probable of recovery under the affiliates’ rate
    regulation process.

Basis of comparison

— Certain prior-year
    amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year
    presentation.

Use of estimates

— The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The most significant
    estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, legal and
    environmental accruals, insurance accruals, pension and
    postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes, asset
    retirement obligations, impairment of long-lived assets, risk
    management and trading activities, fair value measurements and
    the valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets
    and other long-lived assets. Actual results could differ from
    those estimates.

Regulation

— Our natural gas distribution and
    regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to
    regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of
    accounting records and various other matters by the respective
    regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. Our
    accounting policies recognize the financial effects of the
    ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various
    regulatory commissions. Accounting principles generally accepted
    in the United States require cost-based, rate-regulated entities
    that meet certain criteria to reflect the authorized recovery of
    costs due to regulatory decisions in their financial statements.
    As a result, certain costs are permitted to be capitalized
    rather than expensed because they can be recovered through rates.

We record regulatory assets as a component of other current
    assets and deferred charges and other assets for costs that have
    been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates
    is considered probable. Regulatory liabilities are recorded
    either on the face of the balance sheet or as a component of
    current liabilities, deferred income taxes or deferred credits
    and other liabilities when it is probable that revenues will

be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers
    through the ratemaking process. Significant regulatory assets
    and liabilities as of September 30, 2011 and 2010 included
    the following:

Currently, authorized rates do not include a return on certain
    of our merger and integration costs; however, we recover the
    amortization of these costs. Merger and integration costs, net,
    are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated
    useful lives ranging up to 20 years. Environmental costs
    have been deferred to be included in future rate filings in
    accordance with rulings received from various state regulatory
    commissions. During the fiscal years ended September 30,
    2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized $0.5 million,
    $0.4 million and $0.4 million in amortization expense
    related to these costs.

Revenue recognition

— Sales of natural gas to
    our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly
    basis; however, the billing cycle periods for certain classes of
    customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods
    used for financial reporting purposes. We follow the revenue
    accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution
    segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to
    customers, but not yet billed under the cycle billing method,
    are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to
    expense. During the year ended September 30, 2009 we
    recognized a non-recurring $7.6 million increase in gross
    profit associated with a one-time update to our estimate for gas
    delivered to customers but not yet billed, resulting from base
    rate changes in several jurisdictions.

On occasion, we are permitted to implement new rates that have
    not been formally approved by our state regulatory commissions,
    which are subject to refund. As permitted by accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States, we recognize
    this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be
    refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which
    the rates were implemented.

Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for
    increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through
    purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas cost
    adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of
    recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without
    filing a rate case to address all of the utility company’s
    non-gas costs. There is no gross profit generated through
    purchased gas cost adjustments, but they provide a

dollar-for-dollar

offset to increases or decreases in our natural gas distribution
    segment’s gas costs. The effects of these purchased gas
    cost adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on
    our balance sheet.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Operating revenues for our nonregulated segment and the
    associated carrying value of natural gas inventory (inclusive of
    storage costs) are recognized when we sell the gas and
    physically deliver it to our customers. Operating revenues
    include realized gains and losses arising from the settlement of
    financial instruments used in our nonregulated activities and
    unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair
    value of natural gas inventory designated as a hedged item in a
    fair value hedge and the associated financial instruments. For
    the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009,
    we included unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts of
    $(10.4) million, $(7.8) million and
    $(35.9) million as a component of nonregulated revenues.

Operating revenues for our regulated transmission and storage
    and nonregulated segments are recognized in the period in which
    actual volumes are transported and storage services are provided.

Cash and cash equivalents

— We consider all
    highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
    months or less to be cash equivalents.

Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts

— Accounts receivable arise from natural gas sales
    to residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and other
    customers. For substantially all of our receivables, we
    establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our
    collection experience. On certain other receivables where we are
    aware of a specific customer’s inability or reluctance to
    pay, we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against
    amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount
    we reasonably expect to collect. However, if circumstances
    change, our estimate of the recoverability of accounts
    receivable could be affected. Circumstances which could affect
    our estimates include, but are not limited to, customer credit
    issues, the level of natural gas prices, customer deposits and
    general economic conditions. Accounts are written off once they
    are deemed to be uncollectible.

Gas stored underground

— Our gas stored
    underground is comprised of natural gas injected into storage to
    support the winter season withdrawals for our natural gas
    distribution operations and natural gas held by our nonregulated
    segment to conduct their operations. The average cost method is
    used for all our regulated operations, except for certain
    jurisdictions in the Kentucky/Mid-States Division, where it is
    valued on the

first-in

first-out method basis, in accordance with regulatory
    requirements. Our nonregulated segment utilizes the average cost
    method; however, most of this inventory is hedged and is
    therefore reported at fair value at the end of each month. Gas
    in storage that is retained as cushion gas to maintain reservoir
    pressure is classified as property, plant and equipment and is
    valued at cost.

Regulated property, plant and equipment

— Regulated property, plant and equipment is
    stated at original cost, net of contributions in aid of
    construction. The cost of additions includes direct construction
    costs, payroll related costs (taxes, pensions and other fringe
    benefits), administrative and general costs and an allowance for
    funds used during construction. The allowance for funds used
    during construction represents the estimated cost of funds used
    to finance the construction of major projects and are
    capitalized in the rate base for ratemaking purposes when the
    completed projects are placed in service. Interest expense of
    $1.7 million, $3.9 million and $4.9 million was
    capitalized in 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Major renewals, including replacement pipe, and betterments that
    are recoverable under our regulatory rate base are capitalized
    while the costs of maintenance and repairs that are not
    recoverable through rates are charged to expense as incurred.
    The costs of large projects are accumulated in construction in
    progress until the project is completed. When the project is
    completed, tested and placed in service, the balance is
    transferred to the regulated plant in service account included
    in the rate base and depreciation begins.

Regulated property, plant and equipment is depreciated at
    various rates on a straight-line basis. These rates are approved
    by our regulatory commissions and are comprised of two
    components: one based on average service life and one based on
    cost of removal. Accordingly, we recognize our cost of removal
    expense as a component of depreciation expense. The related cost
    of removal accrual is reflected as a regulatory liability on the
    consolidated balance sheet. At the time property, plant and
    equipment is retired, removal



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

expenses less salvage, are charged to the regulatory cost of
    removal accrual. The composite depreciation rate was
    3.6 percent, 3.5 percent and 3.8 percent for the
    fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Nonregulated property, plant and equipment

— Nonregulated property, plant and equipment is
    stated at cost. Depreciation is generally computed on the
    straight-line method for financial reporting purposes based upon
    estimated useful lives ranging from three to 50 years.

Asset retirement obligations

— We record a
    liability at fair value for an asset retirement obligation when
    the legal obligation to retire the asset has been incurred with
    an offsetting increase to the carrying value of the related
    asset. Accretion of the asset retirement obligation due to the
    passage of time is recorded as an operating expense.

As of September 30, 2011 and 2010, we recorded asset
    retirement obligations of $14.0 million and
    $11.4 million. Additionally, we recorded $5.4 million
    and $3.8 million of asset retirement costs as a component
    of property, plant and equipment that will be depreciated over
    the remaining life of the underlying associated assets.

We believe we have a legal obligation to retire our natural gas
    storage facilities. However, we have not recognized an asset
    retirement obligation associated with our storage facilities
    because we are not able to determine the settlement date of this
    obligation as we do not anticipate taking our storage facilities
    out of service permanently. Therefore, we cannot reasonably
    estimate the fair value of this obligation.

Impairment of long-lived assets

— We
    periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have
    occurred that indicate that other long-lived assets may not be
    recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant
    revision. When such events or circumstances are present, we
    assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining
    whether the carrying value will be recovered through the
    expected future cash flows. In the event the sum of the expected
    future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less
    than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss equal
    to the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair
    value is recorded.

During fiscal 2011, we recorded pretax noncash impairment losses
    of $19.3 million related to our Fort Necessity storage
    project and $11.0 million related to our gathering system,
    as discussed in Note 5.

Goodwill and intangible assets

— We annually
    evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second
    fiscal quarter or more frequently as impairment indicators
    arise. We use a present value technique based on discounted cash
    flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. These
    calculations are dependent on several subjective factors
    including the timing of future cash flows, future growth rates
    and the discount rate. An impairment charge is recognized if the
    carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its
    fair value.

Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives of
    10 years. These assets are reviewed for impairment as
    impairment indicators arise. When such events or circumstances
    are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets
    by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered
    through the expected future cash flows. In the event the sum of
    the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the
    asset is less than the carrying value of the asset, an
    impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset’s carrying
    value over its fair value is recorded. No impairment has been
    recognized.

Marketable securities

— As of
    September 30, 2011 and 2010, all of our marketable
    securities were classified as

available-for-sale.

In accordance with the authoritative accounting standards, these
    securities are reported at market value with unrealized gains
    and losses shown as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss). We regularly evaluate the
    performance of these investments on a fund by fund basis for
    impairment, taking into consideration the fund’s purpose,
    volatility and current returns. If a determination is made that
    a decline in fair value is other than temporary, the related
    fund is written down to its estimated fair value.



ATMOS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Due to the deterioration of the financial markets in late
    calendar 2008 and early calendar 2009 and the uncertainty of a
    full recovery of these investments given the then current
    economic environment, we recorded a $5.4 million noncash
    charge to impair certain

available-for-sale

investments during fiscal 2009.

Financial instruments and hedging activities

— We currently use financial instruments to
    mitigate commodity price risk. Additionally, we periodically use
    financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. The
    objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have
    been tailored to our regulated and nonregulated businesses.
    Currently, we utilize financial instruments in our natural gas
    distribution and nonregulated segments. The objectives and
    strategies for the use of financial instruments are discussed in
    Note 4.

We record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet
    at fair value

,

with changes in fair value ultimately
    recorded in the income statement. These financial instruments
    are reported as risk management assets and liabilities and are
    classified as current or noncurrent other assets or liabilities
    based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying
    financial instrument.

The timing of when changes in fair value of our financial
    instruments are recorded in the income statement depends on
    whether the financial instrument has been designated and
    qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory
    rulings require a different accounting treatment. Changes in
    fair value for financial instruments that do not meet one of
    these criteria are recognized in the income statement as they
    occur.

Financial
    Instruments Associated with Commodity Price Risk

In our natural gas distribution segment, the costs associated
    with and the gains and losses arising from the use of financial
    instruments to mitigate commodity price risk are included in our
    purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms in accordance with
    regulatory requirements. Therefore, changes in the fair value of
    these financial instruments are initially recorded as a
    component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the
    consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas
    cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and
    recognized in revenue in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, there is
    no earnings impact on our natural gas distribution segment as a
    result of the use of financial instruments.

In our nonregulated segment, we have designated most of the
    natural gas inventory held by this operating segment as the
    hedged item in a fair-value hedge. This inventory is marked to
    market at the end of each month based on the Gas Daily index,
    with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or
    losses in revenue in the period of change. The financial
    instruments associated with this natural gas inventory have been
    designated as fair-value hedges and are marked to market each
    month based upon the NYMEX price with changes in fair value
    recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the
    period of change. Changes in the spreads between the forward
    natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated
    against our physical inventory (NYMEX) and the market (spot)
    prices used to value our physical storage (Gas Daily) result in
    unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is
    withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled.
    Once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are
    settled, the previously unrealized margins associated with these
    net positions are realized. We have elected to exclude this
    spot/forward differential for purposes of assessing the
    effectiveness of these fair-value hedges. Over time, we expect
    gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be
    offset by gains and losses on the fair-value hedges, resulting
    in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we
    anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction.

In our nonregulated segment, we have elected to treat
    fixed-price forward contracts to deliver natural gas as normal
    purchases and normal sales. As such, these deliveries are
    recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with our revenue
    recognition policy. Financial instruments used to mitigate the
    commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been
    designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and
    sales at indexed prices. Accordingly, unrealized gains and
    losses on these open financial instruments are recorded as a



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and are
    recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged
    volumes are sold. Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred,
    is reported as a component of revenue.

Gains and losses from hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in
    the income statement. Fair value and cash flow hedge
    ineffectiveness arising from natural gas market price
    differences between the locations of the hedged inventory and
    the delivery location specified in the financial instruments is
    referred to as basis ineffectiveness. Ineffectiveness arising
    from changes in the fair value of the fair value hedges due to
    changes in the difference between the spot price and the futures
    price, as well as the difference between the timing of the
    settlement of the futures and the valuation of the underlying
    physical commodity is referred to as timing ineffectiveness.

In our nonregulated segment, we also utilize master netting
    agreements with significant counterparties that allow us to
    offset gains and losses arising from financial instruments that
    may be settled in cash with gains and losses arising from
    financial instruments that may be settled with the physical
    commodity. Assets and liabilities from risk management
    activities, as well as accounts receivable and payable, reflect
    the master netting agreements in place. Additionally, the
    accounting guidance for master netting arrangements requires us
    to include the fair value of cash collateral or the obligation
    to return cash in the amounts that have been netted under master
    netting agreements used to offset gains and losses arising from
    financial instruments. As of September 30, 2011 and 2010,
    the Company netted $28.8 million and $24.9 million of
    cash held in margin accounts into its current risk management
    assets and liabilities.

Financial
    Instruments Associated with Interest Rate Risk

We periodically manage interest rate risk, typically when we
    issue new or refinance existing long-term debt. In fiscal 2011
    and in prior years, we entered into Treasury lock agreements to
    fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated
    with anticipated financings. We designated these Treasury lock
    agreements as cash flow hedges at the time the agreements were
    executed. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses associated
    with the Treasury lock agreements were recorded as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). When the
    Treasury locks were settled, the realized gain or loss was
    recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) and is being recognized as a component of interest
    expense over the life of the related financing arrangement.
    Hedge ineffectiveness to the extent incurred is reported as a
    component of interest expense.

Fair Value Measurements —

We report certain
    assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the
    price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
    transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants at the measurement date (exit price). We primarily
    use quoted market prices and other observable market pricing
    information in valuing our financial assets and liabilities and
    minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our
    measurements.

Prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to
    determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities
    recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. Within our
    nonregulated operations, we utilize a mid-market pricing
    convention (the mid-point between the bid and ask prices) as a
    practical expedient for determining fair value measurement, as
    permitted under current accounting standards. Values derived
    from these sources reflect the market in which transactions
    involving these financial instruments are executed. We utilize
    models and other valuation methods to determine fair value when
    external sources are not available. Values are adjusted to
    reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our
    positions over a reasonable period of time under then-current
    market conditions. We believe the market prices and models used
    to value these assets and liabilities represent the best
    information available with respect to closing exchange and

over-the-counter

quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the
    assets and liabilities.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Fair-value estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and
    the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved. Our
    counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and
    major energy companies. This concentration of counterparties may
    materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from
    market, economic or regulatory conditions. Adverse developments
    in the last few years in the global financial and credit markets
    have periodically made it more difficult and more expensive for
    companies to access the short-term capital markets, which may
    negatively impact the creditworthiness of our counterparties.
    Any further tightening of the credit markets could cause more of
    our counterparties to fail to perform. We seek to minimize
    counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their
    financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral
    requirements under certain circumstances.

Amounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially
    significant volatility based upon changes in market prices, the
    valuation of the portfolio of our contracts, maturity and
    settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions,
    each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our
    financial instruments. We believe the market prices and models
    used to value these financial instruments represent the best
    information available with respect to closing exchange and

over-the-counter

quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the
    contracts. Values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact
    of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable
    period of time under then current market conditions.

Authoritative accounting literature establishes a fair value
    hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value
    based on observable and unobservable data. The hierarchy
    categorizes the inputs into three levels, with the highest
    priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the
    lowest priority given to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The
    levels of the hierarchy are described below:

Level 1

— Represents unadjusted quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An
    active market for the asset or liability is defined as a market
    in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with
    sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information
    on an ongoing basis. Our Level 1 measurements consist
    primarily of exchange-traded financial instruments, gas stored
    underground that has been designated as the hedged item in a
    fair value hedge and our

available-for-sale

securities. The Level 1 measurements for investments in our
    Master Trust, Supplemental Executive Benefit Plan and
    postretirement benefit plan consist primarily of exchange-traded
    financial instruments.

Level 2

— Represents pricing inputs other
    than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are either
    directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability as
    of the reporting date. These inputs are derived principally
    from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Our
    Level 2 measurements primarily consist of
    non-exchange-traded financial instruments, such as

over-the-counter

options and swaps and municipal and corporate bonds where market
    data for pricing is observable. The Level 2 measurements
    for investments in our Master Trust, Supplemental Executive
    Benefit Plan and postretirement benefit plan consist primarily
    of non-exchange traded financial instruments such as common
    collective trusts and investments in limited partnerships.

Level 3

— Represents generally
    unobservable pricing inputs which are developed based on the
    best information available, including our own internal data, in
    situations where there is little if any market activity for the
    asset or liability at the measurement date. The pricing inputs
    utilized reflect what a market participant would use to
    determine fair value. Our Master Trust has investments in real
    estate that qualify as Level 3 fair value measurements.
    Currently, we have no other assets or liabilities recorded at
    fair value that would qualify for Level 3 reporting.

Pension and other postretirement plans

— Pension and other postretirement plan costs and
    liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are
    affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the
    market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on
    plan assets, assumed discount rates and current demographic and
    actuarial mortality data. Through fiscal 2008, we reviewed the
    estimates and assumptions



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and
    liabilities annually based upon a June 30 measurement date. To
    comply with the new measurement date requirements established by
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and incorporated
    into accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States, effective October 1, 2008, we changed our
    measurement date from June 30 to our fiscal year end,
    September 30. This change is more fully discussed in
    Note 9. The assumed discount rate and the expected return
    are the assumptions that generally have the most significant
    impact on our pension costs and liabilities. The assumed
    discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate and
    assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant
    impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities.

In August 2010, the Board of Directors of Atmos Energy approved
    a proposal to close the Pension Account Plan (PAP) to new
    participants, effective October 1, 2010. Employees
    participating in the PAP as of October 1, 2010 were allowed
    to make a one-time election to migrate from the PAP into our
    defined contribution plan which was enhanced, effective
    January 1, 2011. Participants who chose to remain in the
    PAP will continue to earn benefits and interest allocations with
    no changes to their existing benefits.

The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the
    actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement
    obligation and net pension and postretirement cost. When
    establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality
    corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace
    that are suitable for settling the obligations, changes in those
    rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is
    derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with
    currently available high quality corporate bonds.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in
    calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the
    annual pension and postretirement plan cost. We estimate the
    expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond
    returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of
    active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset
    rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the
    guidance from our investment advisors in making a final
    determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the
    extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the
    course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate,
    that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan cost is
    not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases
    future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of
    approximately ten to twelve years.

The market-related value of our plan assets represents the fair
    market value of the plan assets, adjusted to smooth out
    short-term market fluctuations over a five-year period. The use
    of this calculation will delay the impact of current market
    fluctuations on the pension expense for the period.

We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in
    determining our annual postretirement net cost based upon our
    actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently
    enacted legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed
    rate of retirement is estimated based upon the annual review of
    our participant census information as of the measurement date.

Income taxes

— Income taxes are provided based
    on the liability method, which results in income tax assets and
    liabilities arising from temporary differences. Temporary
    differences are differences between the tax bases of assets and
    liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial
    statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in
    future years. The liability method requires the effect of tax
    rate changes on current and accumulated deferred income taxes to
    be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted.
    The liability method also requires that deferred tax assets be
    reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than
    not that the assets will be realized.

The Company may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax
    positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the
    tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
    authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The
    tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a
    position should be measured based on the largest benefit that
    has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized
    upon settlement with the taxing authorities. We recognize
    accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as a

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

component of interest expense. We recognize penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits as a component of miscellaneous income
    (expense) in accordance with regulatory requirements.

Stock-based compensation plans

— We maintain
    the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan that provides for the granting
    of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock
    appreciation rights, bonus stock, time-lapse restricted stock,
    performance-based restricted stock units and stock units to
    officers, division presidents and other key employees.
    Non-employee directors are also eligible to receive stock-based
    compensation under the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The
    objectives of this plan include attracting and retaining the
    best personnel, providing for additional performance incentives
    and promoting our success by providing employees with the
    opportunity to acquire our common stock.

Accumulated other comprehensive loss

— Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of
    tax, as of September 30, 2011 and 2010, consisted of the

    recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.

Recent accounting pronouncements

— During the
    year ended September 30, 2011, two new accounting standards
    became applicable to the Company pertaining to goodwill
    impairment testing for reporting units with zero or negative
    carrying amounts and disclosure of supplementary pro forma
    information for business combinations. The adoption of these
    standards had no impact on our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows. There were no other significant
    changes to our accounting policies during the year ended
    September 30, 2011.

For interim and annual periods beginning after December 15,
    2011, three new accounting pronouncements will become applicable
    to the Company including guidance that will change certain fair
    value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure
    requirements particularly for Level 3 fair value
    measurements, guidance related to the presentation of other
    comprehensive income which will require that all nonowner
    changes in shareholders’ equity be presented either in a
    single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two
    separate but consecutive statements and new guidance related to
    goodwill impairment testing that will permit an entity to first
    assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more
    likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less
    than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it
    is necessary to perform the traditional two-step goodwill
    impairment test. The adoption of these standards should not
    impact our financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Regulated
    Commodity Risk Management Activities

Although our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms
    essentially insulate our natural gas distribution segment from
    commodity price risk, our customers are exposed to the effects
    of volatile natural gas prices. We manage this exposure through
    a combination of physical storage, fixed-price forward contracts
    and financial instruments, primarily

over-the-counter

swap and option contracts, in an effort to minimize the impact
    of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the
    winter heating season.

Our natural gas distribution gas supply department is
    responsible for executing this segment’s commodity risk
    management activities in conformity with regulatory
    requirements. In jurisdictions where we are permitted to
    mitigate commodity price risk through financial instruments, the
    relevant regulatory authorities may

    hedged. Historically, if the regulatory authority does not
    establish this level, we seek to hedge between 25 and
    50 percent of anticipated heating season gas purchases
    using financial instruments. For the

2010-2011

heating season (generally October through March), in the
    jurisdictions where we are permitted to utilize financial
    instruments, we hedged approximately 35 percent, or
    31.7 Bcf of the winter flowing gas requirements at a
    weighted average cost of approximately $5.81 per Mcf. We have
    not designated these financial instruments as hedges.

The costs associated with and the gains and losses arising from
    the use of financial instruments to mitigate commodity price
    risk are included in our purchased gas cost adjustment
    mechanisms in accordance with regulatory requirements.
    Therefore, changes in the fair value of these financial
    instruments are initially recorded as a component of deferred
    gas costs and recognized in the consolidated statement of income
    as a component of purchased gas cost when the related costs are
    recovered through our rates and recognized in revenue in
    accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance.
    Accordingly, there is no earnings impact on our natural gas
    distribution segment as a result of the use of financial
    instruments.

Nonregulated
    Commodity Risk Management Activities

In our nonregulated operations, we aggregate and purchase gas
    supply, arrange transportation

and/or

storage logistics and ultimately deliver gas to our customers at
    competitive prices. To facilitate this process, we utilize
    proprietary and customer-owned transportation and storage assets
    to provide the various services our customers’ request.

We also perform asset optimization activities in our
    nonregulated segment. Through asset optimization activities, we
    seek to enhance our gross profit by maximizing the economic
    value associated with the storage and transportation capacity we
    own or control. We attempt to meet this objective by engaging in
    natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and
    profit from the pricing differences that occur over time. We
    purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial
    instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit
    margin. Through the use of transportation and storage services
    and financial instruments, we also seek to capture gross profit
    margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences that exist
    in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that
    occur over time. Over time, gains and losses on the sale of
    storage gas inventory should be offset by gains and losses on
    the financial instruments, resulting in the realization of the
    economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we
    structured the original transaction.

As a result of these activities, our nonregulated segment is
    exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of
    natural gas. We manage our exposure to such risks through a
    combination of physical storage and financial instruments,
    including futures,

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with
    counterparties. Future contracts provide the right to buy or
    sell the commodity at a fixed price in the future. Option
    contracts provide the right, but not the requirement, to buy or
    sell the commodity at a fixed price. Swap contracts require
    receipt of payment for the commodity based on the difference
    between a fixed price and the market price on the settlement
    date.

We use financial instruments, designated as cash flow hedges of
    anticipated purchases and sales at index prices, to mitigate the
    commodity price risk in our nonregulated operations associated
    with deliveries under fixed-priced forward contracts to deliver
    gas to customers. These financial instruments have maturity
    dates ranging from one to 62 months. We use financial
    instruments, designated as fair value hedges, to hedge our
    natural gas inventory used in our asset optimization activities
    in our nonregulated segment.

Also, in nonregulated operations, we use storage swaps and
    futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities
    that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair
    value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory,
    basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our
    fixed price and storage books and various

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options. These financial instruments have
    not been designated as hedges.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Our nonregulated risk management activities are controlled
    through various risk management policies and procedures. Our
    Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for our
    nonregulated risk management limits and policies. A risk
    committee, comprised of corporate and business unit officers, is
    responsible for establishing and enforcing our nonregulated risk
    management policies and procedures.

Under our risk management policies, we seek to match our
    financial instrument positions to our physical storage positions
    as well as our expected current and future sales and purchase
    obligations in order to maintain no open positions at the end of
    each trading day. The determination of our net open position as
    of any day, however, requires us to make assumptions as to
    future circumstances, including the use of gas by our customers
    in relation to our anticipated storage and market positions.
    Because the price risk associated with any net open position at
    the end of each day may increase if the assumptions are not
    realized, we review these assumptions as part of our daily
    monitoring activities. Our operations can also be affected by
    intraday fluctuations of gas prices, since the price of natural
    gas purchased or sold for future delivery earlier in the day may
    not be hedged until later in the day. At times, limited net open
    positions related to our existing and anticipated commitments
    may occur. At the close of business on September 30, 2011,
    our nonregulated segment had net open positions (including
    existing storage and related financial contracts) of
    0.1 Bcf.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management Activities

We periodically manage interest rate risk by entering into
    Treasury lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of
    the interest cost associated with anticipated financings.

We intend to refinance our $250 million unsecured
    5.125% Senior Notes that mature in January 2013 through the
    issuance of $350 million

30-year

unsecured notes. In August 2011, we entered into three Treasury
    lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the
    interest cost associated with the anticipated issuances of these
    senior notes. We designated all of these Treasury locks as cash
    flow hedges.

In September 2010, we entered into three Treasury lock
    agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest
    cost associated with $300 million of a total
    $400 million of senior notes that were issued in June 2011.
    This offering is discussed in Note 7. We designated these
    Treasury locks as cash flow hedges. The Treasury locks were
    settled on June 7, 2011 with the receipt of
    $20.1 million from the counterparties due to an increase in
    the

30-year

Treasury lock rates between inception of the Treasury locks and
    settlement. Because the Treasury locks were effective, the net
    $12.6 million unrealized gain was recorded as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized
    as a component of interest expense over the

30-year

life
    of the senior notes.

Additionally, our original fiscal 2011 financing plans included
    the issuance of $250 million of

30-year

unsecured notes in November 2011 to fund our capital expenditure
    program. In September 2010, we entered into two Treasury lock
    agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest
    cost associated with the anticipated issuance of these senior
    notes, which were designated as cash flow hedges. Due primarily
    to stronger than anticipated cash flows primarily resulting from
    the extension of the Bush tax cuts that allow the continued use
    of bonus depreciation on qualifying expenditures through
    December 31, 2011, the need to issue $250 million of
    debt in November was eliminated and the related Treasury lock
    agreements were unwound in March 2011. As a result of unwinding
    these Treasury locks, we recognized a pre-tax cash gain of
    $27.8 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2011.

In prior years, we entered into several Treasury lock agreements
    to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost of
    financing for various issuances of long-term debt and senior
    notes. The gains and losses realized upon settlement of these
    Treasury locks were recorded as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) when they were settled and are being
    recognized as a component of interest

Impact of
    Financial Instruments on the Income Statement

Hedge ineffectiveness for our nonregulated segment is recorded
    as a component of unrealized gross profit and primarily results
    from differences in the location and timing of the derivative
    instrument and the hedged item. Hedge ineffectiveness could
    materially affect our results of operations for the reported
    period. For the years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and
    2009 we recognized a gain arising from fair value and cash flow
    hedge ineffectiveness of $24.8 million, $51.8 million
    and $6.4 million. Additional information regarding
    ineffectiveness recognized in the income statement is included
    in the tables below.

Basis ineffectiveness arises from natural gas market price
    differences between the locations of the hedged inventory and
    the delivery location specified in the hedge instruments. Timing
    ineffectiveness arises due to changes in the difference between
    the spot price and the futures price, as well as the difference
    between the timing of the settlement of the futures and the
    valuation of the underlying physical commodity. As the commodity
    contract nears the settlement date,

spot-to-forward

price differences should converge, which should reduce or
    eliminate the impact of this ineffectiveness on revenue.

Financial
    Instruments Not Designated as Hedges

The impact of financial instruments that have not been
    designated as hedges on our consolidated income statements for
    the years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was an
    increase (decrease) in revenue of $(1.4) million,
    $15.4 million and $36.9 million. Note that this
    presentation does not reflect the expected gains or losses
    arising from the underlying physical transactions associated
    with these financial instruments. Therefore, this presentation
    is not indicative of the economic gross profit we realized when
    the underlying physical and financial transactions were settled.

As discussed above, financial instruments used in our natural
    gas distribution segment are not designated as hedges. However,
    there is no earnings impact on our natural gas distribution
    segment as a result of the use of these financial instruments
    because the gains and losses arising from the use of these
    financial instruments are recognized in the consolidated
    statement of income as a component of purchased gas cost when
    the related costs are recovered through our rates and recognized
    in revenue. Accordingly, the impact of these financial
    instruments is excluded from this presentation.

Fair
    Value Measurements

We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is
    defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or
    paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
    market participants at the measurement date (exit price). We
    record cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
    accounts payable at carrying value, which substantially
    approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these
    assets and liabilities. For other financial assets and
    liabilities, we primarily use quoted market prices and other
    observable market pricing information to minimize the use of
    unobservable pricing inputs in our measurements when determining
    fair value. The methods used to determine fair value for our
    assets and liabilities are fully described in Note 2.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Fair value measurements also apply to the valuation of our
    pension and post-retirement plan assets. The fair value of these
    assets is presented in Note 9 below.

The classification of our fair value measurements requires
    judgment regarding the degree to which market data are
    observable or corroborated by observable market data. The
    following tables summarize, by level within the fair value
    hierarchy, our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at
    fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2011
    and 2010. As required under authoritative accounting literature,
    assets and liabilities are categorized in their entirety based
    on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
    value measurement.

At September 30, 2011 and 2010, our

available-for-sale

securities included $38.3 million and $41.5 million
    related to assets held in separate rabbi trusts for our
    supplemental executive benefit plans as discussed in
    Note 9. At September 30, 2011 we maintained
    investments in bonds that have contractual maturity dates
    ranging from January 2012 through January 2016.

We maintained an investment in one foreign equity mutual fund
    with a fair value of $2.3 million in an unrealized loss
    position of $0.2 million as of September 30, 2011.
    This fund has been in an unrealized loss position for less than
    twelve months. Because this fund is only used to fund the
    supplemental plans, we evaluate investment performance over a
    long-term horizon. Based upon our intent and ability to hold
    this investment, our ability to direct the source of the
    payments in order to maximize the life of the portfolio, the
    short-term nature of the decline in fair value and the fact that
    this fund continues to receive good ratings from mutual fund
    rating companies, we do not consider this impairment to be

other-than-temporary

as of September 30, 2011. We also maintained several bonds
    with a cumulative fair value of $9.9 million in an
    unrealized loss position of less than $0.1 million as of
    September 30, 2011. These bonds have been in an unrealized
    loss position for less than twelve months. Based upon our intent
    and ability to hold these investments, our ability to direct the
    source of the payments in order to maximize the life of the
    portfolio, the short-term nature of the decline in fair value
    and the fact that these bonds are investment-grade, we do not
    consider this impairment to be

other-than-temporary

as of September 30, 2011.

At September 30, 2010, we did not maintain any investments
    that were in an unrealized loss position. In fiscal 2009, we
    recorded a $5.4 million noncash charge to impair certain
    available-for sale investments during the year ended
    September 30, 2009 due to the conditions of the financial
    markets at that time.

Other
    Fair Value Measures

In addition to the financial instruments above, we have several
    financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities subject to
    fair value measures. These financial assets and liabilities
    include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
    payable and debt. The nonfinancial assets and liabilities
    include asset retirement obligations and pension and
    post-retirement plan assets. We record cash and cash
    equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt at
    carrying value. For cash and cash equivalents, accounts
    receivable and accounts payable, we consider carrying value to
    materially approximate fair value due to the short-term nature
    of these assets and liabilities.

Atmos Gathering Company (AGC) owns and operates the Park City
    and Shrewsbury gathering systems in Kentucky. The Park City
    gathering system consists of a

23-mile

low
    pressure pipeline and a nitrogen removal unit that was
    constructed in 2008. The Shrewsbury production, gathering and
    processing assets were acquired in 2008 at which time we sold
    the production assets to a third party. As a result of the sale
    of the production assets, we obtained a

10-year

production payment note under which we were to be paid from
    future production generated from the assets.

As discussed in Note 13, AGC is involved in an ongoing
    lawsuit with the Park City gathering system. Due to the lawsuit
    and a low natural gas price environment, the assets have
    generated operating losses. As a result of these developments,
    we performed an impairment assessment of these assets during the
    third fiscal quarter and determined the assets to be impaired.
    We reduced the carrying value of the assets to their estimated
    fair value of approximately $6 million and recorded a
    pre-tax noncash impairment loss of approximately
    $11 million. We used a combination of a market and income
    approach in a weighted average discounted cash flow analysis
    that included significant inputs such as our weighted average
    cost of capital and assumptions regarding future natural gas
    prices. This is a Level 3 fair value measurement because
    the inputs used are unobservable. Based on this analysis, we
    determined the assets to be impaired.

In February 2008, Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC, a subsidiary
    of AEH, announced plans to construct and operate a salt-cavern
    storage project in Franklin Parish, Louisiana. In March 2010, we
    entered into an option and acquisition agreement with a third
    party, which provided the third party with the exclusive option
    to develop the proposed Fort Necessity salt-dome natural
    gas storage project. In July 2010, we agreed with the third
    party to extend the option period to March 2011. In January
    2011, the third party developer notified us that it did not plan
    to commence the activities required to allow it to exercise the
    option by March 2011; accordingly, the option was terminated. We
    evaluated our strategic alternatives and concluded the
    project’s returns did not meet our investment objectives.
    Accordingly, in March 2011, we recorded a $19.3 million
    pretax noncash impairment loss to write off substantially all of
    our investment in the project.

Our debt is recorded at carrying value. The fair value of our
    debt is determined using third party market value quotations.

Discontinued
    Operations

On May 12, 2011, we entered into a definitive agreement to
    sell all of our natural gas distribution assets located in
    Missouri, Illinois and Iowa to Liberty Energy (Midstates)
    Corporation, an affiliate of Algonquin Power &
    Utilities Corp. for a cash price of approximately
    $124 million. The agreement contains terms and conditions
    customary for transactions of this type, including typical
    adjustments to the purchase price at closing, if applicable. The
    closing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of
    customary conditions including the receipt of applicable
    regulatory approvals.

As required under generally accepted accounting principles, the
    operating results of our Missouri, Illinois and Iowa operations
    have been aggregated and reported on the consolidated statements
    of income as income from discontinued operations, net of income
    tax. Expenses related to general corporate overhead and interest
    expense allocated to their operations are not included in
    discontinued operations.

The tables below set forth selected financial and operational
    information related to net assets and operating results related
    to discontinued operations. Additionally, assets and liabilities
    related to our Missouri, Illinois and Iowa operations are

As noted above, our unsecured 10% notes will mature in
    December 2011; accordingly, these have been classified within
    the current maturities of long-term debt.

Our $350 million 7.375% senior notes were paid on
    their maturity date on May 15, 2011, using commercial paper
    borrowings. We replaced these senior notes on June 10, 2011
    with $400 million 5.50% senior notes. The effective
    interest rate on these notes is 5.381 percent, after giving
    effect to offering costs and the settlement of the
    $300 million Treasury locks discussed in Note 4.
    Substantially all of the net proceeds of approximately
    $394 million was used to repay $350 million of
    outstanding commercial paper. The remainder of the net proceeds
    was used for general corporate purposes.

Short-term
    debt

Our short-term borrowing requirements are affected by the
    seasonal nature of the natural gas business. Changes in the
    price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to
    supply our customers’ needs could significantly affect our
    borrowing requirements. Our short-term borrowings typically
    reach their highest levels in the winter months.

Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we financed our
    short-term borrowing requirements through a combination of a
    $566.7 million commercial paper program and four committed
    revolving credit facilities with third-party lenders that
    provided approximately $1.0 billion of working capital
    funding. On April 13, 2011, our $200 million

180-day

unsecured credit facility expired and was not replaced. On
    May 2, 2011, we replaced our $566.7 million unsecured
    credit facility with a new five-year $750 million unsecured
    credit

facility with an accordion feature that could increase our
    borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion. On September 30,
    2011, we renewed our

364-day

revolving line of credit facility used to backstop letters of
    credit for our regulated operations and increased the borrowing
    capacity from $6.25 million to $10 million. As a
    result of these changes, we have $985 million of working
    capital funding from our commercial paper program and four
    committed revolving credit facilities with third-party lenders.

At September 30, 2011 and 2010, there was
    $206.4 million and $126.1 million outstanding under
    our commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2011 our
    commercial paper had maturities of less than one week with
    interest rates of 0.29 percent. We also use intercompany
    credit facilities to supplement the funding provided by these
    third-party committed credit facilities. These facilities are
    described in greater detail below.

Regulated
    Operations

We fund our regulated operations as needed, primarily through
    our commercial paper program and three committed revolving
    credit facilities with third-party lenders that provide
    approximately $785 million of working capital funding. The
    first facility is a five-year $750 million unsecured
    facility, expiring May 2016, that bears interest at a base rate
    or at a LIBOR-based rate for the applicable interest period,
    plus a spread ranging from zero percent to 2 percent, based
    on the Company’s credit ratings. This credit facility
    serves as a backup liquidity facility for our commercial paper
    program. At September 30, 2011, there were no borrowings
    under this facility, but we had $206.4 million of
    commercial paper outstanding leaving $543.6 million
    available.

The second facility is a $25 million unsecured facility
    that bears interest at a daily negotiated rate, generally based
    on the Federal Funds rate plus a variable margin. At
    September 30, 2011, there were no borrowings outstanding
    under this facility.

The third facility is a $10 million revolving credit
    facility used primarily to issue letters of credit that bears
    interest at a LIBOR-based rate. At September 30, 2011,
    there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility;
    however, letters of credit totaling $5.9 million had been
    issued under the facility at September 30, 2011, which
    reduced the amount available by a corresponding amount.

The availability of funds under these credit facilities is
    subject to conditions specified in the respective credit
    agreements, all of which we currently satisfy. These conditions
    include our compliance with financial covenants and the
    continued accuracy of representations and warranties contained
    in these agreements. We are required by the financial covenants
    in each of these facilities to maintain, at the end of each
    fiscal quarter, a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of
    no greater than 70 percent. At September 30, 2011, our
    total-debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, as defined, was
    54 percent. In addition, both the interest margin over the
    Eurodollar rate and the fee that we pay on unused amounts under
    each of these facilities are subject to adjustment depending
    upon our credit ratings.

In addition to these third-party facilities, our regulated
    operations have a $350 million intercompany revolving
    credit facility with AEH. This facility bears interest at the
    lower of (i) the one-month LIBOR rate plus
    0.45 percent or (ii) the marginal borrowing rate
    available to the Company on the date of borrowing. The marginal
    borrowing rate is defined as the lower of (i) a rate based
    upon the lower of the Prime Rate or the Eurodollar rate under
    the five year revolving credit facility or (ii) the lowest
    rate outstanding under the commercial paper program. Applicable
    state regulatory commissions have approved our use of this
    facility through December 31, 2011. There was
    $181.3 million outstanding under this facility at
    September 30, 2011.

Nonregulated
    Operations

Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC (AEM), which is wholly-owned by AEH,
    has a three-year $200 million committed revolving credit
    facility with a syndicate of third-party lenders with an
    accordion feature that could



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

increase AEM’s borrowing capacity to $500 million. The
    credit facility is primarily used to issue letters of credit
    and, on a less frequent basis, to borrow funds for gas purchases
    and other working capital needs.

At AEM’s option, borrowings made under the credit facility
    are based on a base rate or an offshore rate, in each case plus
    an applicable margin. The base rate is a floating rate equal to
    the higher of: (a) 0.50 percent per annum above the
    latest federal funds rate; (b) the per annum rate of
    interest established by BNP Paribas from time to time as its
    “prime rate” or “base rate” for
    U.S. dollar loans; (c) an offshore rate (based on
    LIBOR with a three-month interest period) as in effect from time
    to time; or (d) the “cost of funds” rate which is
    the cost of funds as reasonably determined by the administrative
    agent. The offshore rate is a floating rate equal to the higher
    of (a) an offshore rate based upon LIBOR for the applicable
    interest period; or (b) a “cost of funds” rate
    referred to above. In the case of both base rate and offshore
    rate loans, the applicable margin ranges from 1.875 percent
    to 2.25 percent per annum, depending on the excess tangible
    net worth of AEM, as defined in the credit facility. This
    facility has swing line loan features, which allow AEM to
    borrow, on a same day basis, an amount ranging from
    $6 million to $30 million based on the terms of an
    election within the agreement. This facility is collateralized
    by substantially all of the assets of AEM and is guaranteed by
    AEH.

At September 30, 2011, there were no borrowings outstanding
    under this credit facility. However, at September 30, 2011,
    AEM letters of credit totaling $20.2 million had been
    issued under the facility, which reduced the amount available by
    a corresponding amount. The amount available under this credit
    facility is also limited by various covenants, including
    covenants based on working capital. Under the most restrictive
    covenant, the amount available to AEM under this credit facility
    was $129.8 million at September 30, 2011.

AEM is required by the financial covenants in this facility to
    maintain a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth that
    does not exceed a maximum of 5 to 1. At September 30, 2011,
    AEM’s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth, as
    defined, was 1.33 to 1. Additionally, AEM must maintain minimum
    levels of net working capital and net worth ranging from
    $20 million to $40 million. As defined in the
    financial covenants, at September 30, 2011, AEM’s net
    working capital was $131.8 million and its tangible net
    worth was $144.5 million.

To supplement borrowings under this facility, AEH has a
    $350 million intercompany demand credit facility with AEC,
    which bears interest at a rate equal to the greater of
    (i) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 3.00 percent or
    (ii) the rate for AEM’s offshore borrowings under its
    committed credit facility plus 0.75 percent. Applicable
    state regulatory commissions have approved our use of this
    facility through December 31, 2011. There were no
    borrowings outstanding under this facility at September 30,
    2011.

Shelf
    Registration

We have an effective shelf registration statement with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that permits us to
    issue a total of $1.3 billion in common stock

and/or

debt
    securities. The shelf registration statement has been approved
    by all requisite state regulatory commissions. Due to certain
    restrictions imposed by one state regulatory commission on our
    ability to issue securities under the new registration
    statement, we were able to issue a total of $950 million in
    debt securities and $350 million in equity securities prior
    to our $400 million senior notes offering in June 2011. At
    September 30, 2011, $900 million remains available for
    issuance. Of this amount, $550 million is available for the
    issuance of debt securities and $350 million remains
    available for the issuance of equity securities under the shelf
    until March 2013.

Debt
    Covenants

In addition to the financial covenants described above, our
    credit facilities and public indentures contain usual and
    customary covenants for our business, including covenants
    substantially limiting liens, substantial asset sales and
    mergers.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Additionally, our public debt indentures relating to our senior
    notes and debentures, as well as our revolving credit
    agreements, each contain a default provision that is triggered
    if outstanding indebtedness arising out of any other credit
    agreements in amounts ranging from in excess of $15 million
    to in excess of $100 million becomes due by acceleration or
    is not paid at maturity.

Further, AEM’s credit agreement contains a cross-default
    provision whereby AEM would be in default if it defaults on
    other indebtedness, as defined, by at least $250 thousand in the
    aggregate.

Finally, AEM’s credit agreement contains a provision that
    would limit the amount of credit available if Atmos Energy were
    downgraded below an S&P rating of BBB and a Moody’s
    rating of Baa2. We have no other triggering events in our debt
    instruments that are tied to changes in specified credit ratings
    or stock price, nor have we entered into any transactions that
    would require us to issue equity, based on our credit rating or
    other triggering events.

We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of
    September 30, 2011. If we were unable to comply with our
    debt covenants, we would likely be required to repay our
    outstanding balances on demand, provide additional collateral or
    take other corrective actions.

Share
    Repurchase Agreement

On, July 1, 2010, we entered into an accelerated share
    repurchase agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. under
    which we repurchased $100 million of our outstanding common
    stock in order to offset stock grants made under our various
    employee and director incentive compensation plans. We paid
    $100 million to Goldman Sachs & Co. on
    July 7, 2010 in a share forward transaction and received
    2,958,580 shares of Atmos Energy common stock. On
    March 4, 2011, we received and retired an additional
    375,468 common shares which concluded our share repurchase
    agreement. In total, we received and retired 3,334,048 common
    shares under the repurchase agreement. The final number of
    shares we ultimately repurchased in the transaction was based
    generally on the average of the effective share repurchase price
    of our common stock over the duration of the agreement, which
    was $29.99. As a result of this transaction, beginning in our
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the number of outstanding shares
    used to calculate our earnings per share was reduced by the
    number of shares received and the $100 million purchase
    price was recorded as a reduction in shareholders’ equity.

Share
    Repurchase Program

On September 28, 2011 our Board of Directors approved a new
    program authorizing the repurchase of up to five million shares
    of common stock over a five-year period. Although the program is
    authorized for a five-year period, it may be terminated or
    limited at any time. Shares may be repurchased in the open
    market or in privately negotiated transactions in amounts the
    company deems appropriate. The program is primarily intended to
    minimize the dilutive effect of equity grants under various
    benefit related incentive compensation plans of the company.

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

Total stock-based compensation expense was $11.6 million,
    $12.7 million and $14.5 million for the fiscal years
    ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, primarily related
    to restricted stock costs.

    Long-Term Incentive Plan

In August 1998, the Board of Directors approved and adopted the
    1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which became effective in
    October 1998 after approval by our shareholders. The LTIP is a
    comprehensive, long-term incentive compensation plan providing
    for discretionary awards of incentive stock options,
    non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, bonus
    stock, time-lapse restricted stock, time-lapse restricted stock
    units, performance-based restricted stock units and stock units
    to certain employees and non-employee directors of the Company
    and our subsidiaries. The objectives of this plan include
    attracting and retaining the best personnel, providing for
    additional performance incentives and promoting our success by
    providing employees with the opportunity to acquire common stock.

As of September 30, 2011, we are authorized to grant awards
    for up to a maximum of 6.5 million shares of common stock
    under this plan subject to certain adjustment provisions. In
    February 2011, shareholders voted to increase the number of
    authorized LTIP shares by 2.2 million shares. On
    October 19, 2011, we received all required state regulatory
    approvals to increase the maximum number of authorized LTIP
    shares to 8.7 million shares, subject to certain adjustment
    provisions. On October 28, 2011, we filed with the SEC a
    registration statement on

Form S-8

to register an additional 2.2 million shares; we also
    listed such shares with the New York Stock Exchange. As of
    September 30, 2011, non-qualified stock options, bonus
    stock, time-lapse restricted stock, time-lapse restricted stock
    units, performance-based restricted stock units and stock units
    had been issued under this plan, and 319,700 shares were
    available for future issuance. The option price of the stock
    options issued under this plan is equal to the market price of
    our stock at the date of grant. These stock options expire
    10 years from the date of the grant and vest annually over
    a service period ranging from one to three years. However, no
    stock options have been granted under this plan since fiscal
    2003, except for a limited number of options that were converted
    from bonuses paid under our Annual Incentive Plan, the last of
    which occurred in fiscal 2006.

Restricted
    Stock Plans

As noted above, the LTIP provides for discretionary awards of
    restricted stock units to help attract, retain and reward
    employees of Atmos Energy and its subsidiaries. Certain of these
    awards vest based upon the passage of time and other awards vest
    based upon the passage of time and the achievement of specified
    performance targets. The fair value of the awards granted is
    based on the market price of our stock at the date of grant. The
    associated expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period.

Employees who are granted shares of time-lapse restricted stock
    under our LTIP have a nonforfeitable right to dividends that are
    paid at the same rate at which they are paid on shares of stock
    without restrictions. In addition, employees who are granted
    shares of time-lapse restricted stock units under our LTIP have
    a nonforfeitable right to dividend equivalents that are paid at
    the same rate at which they are paid on shares of stock without
    restrictions. Both time-lapse restricted stock and time-lapse
    restricted stock units contain only a service condition that the
    employee recipients render continuous services to the Company
    for a period of three years from the date of grant, except for
    accelerated vesting in the event of death, disability, change of
    control of the Company or termination without cause (with
    certain exceptions). There are no performance conditions
    required to be met for employees to be vested in either the
    time-lapse restricted stock or time-lapse restricted stock units.

Employees who are granted shares of performance-based restricted
    stock units under our LTIP have a forfeitable right to dividends
    that accrue at the same rate at which they are paid on shares of
    stock without

restrictions. Dividends on the performance-based restricted
    stock units are paid in the form of shares upon the vesting of
    the award. Performance-based restricted stock units contain a
    service condition that the employee recipients render continuous
    services to the Company for a period of three years from the
    date of grant, except for accelerated vesting in the event of
    death, disability, change of control of the Company or
    termination without cause (with certain exceptions) and a
    performance condition based on a cumulative earnings per share
    target amount.

Other
    Plans

Direct
    Stock Purchase Plan

We maintain a Direct Stock Purchase Plan, open to all investors,
    which allows participants to have all or part of their cash
    dividends paid quarterly in additional shares of our common
    stock. The minimum initial investment required to join the plan
    is $1,250. Direct Stock Purchase Plan participants may purchase
    additional shares of our common stock as often as weekly with
    voluntary cash payments of at least $25, up to an annual maximum
    of $100,000.

Outside
    Directors

Stock-For-Fee

Plan

In November 1994, the Board of Directors adopted the Outside
    Directors

Stock-for-Fee

Plan which was approved by our shareholders in February 1995.
    The plan permits non-employee directors to receive all or part
    of their annual retainer and meeting fees in stock rather than
    in cash.

Equity
    Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
    Directors

In November 1998, the Board of Directors adopted the Equity
    Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
    Directors which was approved by our shareholders in February
    1999. This plan amended the Atmos Energy Corporation Deferred
    Compensation Plan for Outside Directors adopted by the Company
    in May 1990 and replaced the pension payable under our
    Retirement Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The plan provides
    non-employee directors of Atmos Energy with the opportunity to
    defer receipt, until retirement, of compensation for services
    rendered to the Company, invest deferred compensation into
    either a cash account or a stock account and to receive an
    annual grant of share units for each year of service on the
    Board.

Other
    Discretionary Compensation Plans

We adopted the Variable Pay Plan in fiscal 1999 for our
    regulated segments’ employees to give each employee an
    opportunity to share in our financial success based on the
    achievement of key performance measures considered critical to
    achieving business objectives for a given year and has minimum
    and maximum thresholds. The plan must meet the minimum threshold
    for the plan to be funded and distributed to employees. These
    performance measures may include earnings growth objectives,
    improved cash flow objectives or crucial customer satisfaction
    and safety results. We monitor progress towards the achievement
    of the performance measures throughout the year and record
    accruals based upon the expected payout using the best estimates
    available at the time the accrual is recorded. During the last
    several fiscal years, we have used earnings per share as our
    sole performance measure.

In addition, we adopted an incentive plan in October 2001 to
    give the employees in our nonregulated segment an opportunity to
    share in the success of the nonregulated operations. In fiscal
    2010, we modified the award structure of the plan to reflect the
    different performance goals of the front and back office
    employees of our nonregulated operations. The front office award
    structure is based on a fixed percentage of the net income of
    our nonregulated operations that represents the available award
    pool for eligible employees. There is no minimum or maximum
    threshold for the available award pool. The back office award
    structure is based upon the net earnings of the nonregulated
    operations and has minimum and maximum thresholds. The plan must
    meet the minimum threshold in order for the plan to be funded
    and distributed to employees. We monitor the progress toward the
    achievement of the thresholds throughout the year and record
    accruals based upon the expected payout using the best estimates
    available at the time the accrual is recorded.

Retirement
    and Post-Retirement Employee Benefit Plans

We have both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit
    plans that together cover substantially all of our employees. We
    also maintain post-retirement plans that provide health care
    benefits to retired employees. Finally, we sponsor defined
    contribution plans which cover substantially all employees.
    These plans are discussed in further detail below.

As a rate regulated entity, we generally recover our pension
    costs in our rates over a period of up to 15 years. The
    amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic

    Benefit Plans

Employee
    Pension Plans

As of September 30, 2011, we maintained two defined benefit
    plans: the Atmos Energy Corporation Pension Account Plan (the
    Plan) and the Atmos Energy Corporation Retirement Plan for
    Mississippi Valley Gas Union Employees (the Union Plan)
    (collectively referred to as the Plans). The assets of the Plans
    are held within the Atmos Energy Corporation Master Retirement
    Trust (the Master Trust).

The Plan is a cash balance pension plan that was established
    effective January 1999 and covers substantially all employees of
    Atmos Energy’s regulated operations. Opening account
    balances were established for participants as of January 1999
    equal to the present value of their respective accrued benefits
    under the pension plans which were previously in effect as of
    December 31, 1998. The Plan credits an allocation to each
    participant’s account at the end of each year according to
    a formula based on the participant’s age, service and total
    pay (excluding incentive pay).

The Plan also provides for an additional annual allocation based
    upon a participant’s age as of January 1, 1999 for
    those participants who were participants in the prior pension
    plans. The Plan credited this additional allocation each year
    through December 31, 2008. In addition, at the end of each
    year, a participant’s account will be credited with
    interest on the employee’s prior year account balance. A
    special grandfather benefit also applied through
    December 31, 2008, for participants who were at least
    age 50 as of January 1, 1999, and who were
    participants in one of the prior plans on December 31,
    1998. Participants are fully vested in their account balances
    after three years of service and may choose to receive their
    account balances as a lump sum or an annuity. In August 2010,
    the Board of Directors of Atmos Energy approved a proposal to
    close the Plan to new participants effective October 1,
    2010. Additionally, employees participating in the Plan as of
    October 1, 2010 were allowed to make a one-time election to
    migrate from the Plan into our defined contribution plan which
    was enhanced, effective January 1, 2011.

The Union Plan is a defined benefit plan that covers
    substantially all full-time union employees in our Mississippi
    Division. Under this plan, benefits are based upon years of
    benefit service and average final earnings. Participants vest in
    the plan after five years and will receive their benefit in an
    annuity.

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an
    amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, including the funding
    requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA).
    However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time
    to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to
    provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but
    also for those expected to be earned in the future.

During fiscal 2011 and 2009, we contributed $0.9 million
    and $21.0 million in cash to the Plans to achieve a desired
    level of funding while maximizing the tax deductibility of this
    payment. In fiscal 2010, we did not make any contributions to
    our pension plans. Based upon market conditions subsequent to
    September 30, 2011, the current funded position of the
    plans and the new funding requirements under the PPA, we
    anticipate contributing between $25 million and
    $30 million to the Plans in fiscal 2012. Further, we will
    consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is prudent
    to maintain certain PPA funding thresholds.

We manage the Master Trust’s assets with the objective of
    achieving a rate of return net of inflation of approximately
    four percent per year. We make investment decisions and evaluate
    performance on a medium-term horizon of at least three to five
    years. We also consider our current financial status when making
    recommendations and decisions regarding the Master Trust’s
    assets. Finally, we strive to ensure the Master Trust’s
    assets are appropriately invested to maintain an acceptable
    level of risk and meet the Master Trust’s long-term asset
    investment policy adopted by the Board of Directors.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

To achieve these objectives, we invest the Master Trust’s
    assets in equity securities, fixed income securities, interests
    in commingled pension trust funds, other investment assets and
    cash and cash equivalents. Investments in equity securities are
    diversified among the market’s various subsectors in an
    effort to diversify risk and maximize returns. Fixed income
    securities are invested in investment grade securities. Cash
    equivalents are invested in securities that either are short
    term (less than 180 days) or readily convertible to cash
    with modest risk.

    assets. These shares generated dividend income for the Plan of
    approximately $1.6 million and $1.6 million during
    fiscal 2011 and 2010.

Our employee pension plan expenses and liabilities are
    determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous
    assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan
    assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets and
    assumed discount rates and demographic data. We review the
    estimates and assumptions underlying our employee pension plans
    annually based upon a September 30 measurement date. The
    development of our assumptions is fully described in our
    significant accounting policies in Note 2. The actuarial
    assumptions used to determine the pension liability for the
    Plans were determined as of September 30, 2011 and 2010 and
    the actuarial assumptions used to determine the net periodic
    pension cost for the Plans were determined as of
    September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008. These assumptions are

Supplemental
    Executive Benefits Plans

We have a nonqualified Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan
    which provides additional pension, disability and death benefits
    to our officers, division presidents and certain other employees
    of the Company who were employed on or before August 12,
    1998. In addition, in August 1998, we adopted the Supplemental
    Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) (formerly known as the
    Performance-Based Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan), which
    covers all employees who become officers or division presidents
    after August 12, 1998 or any other employees selected by
    our Board of Directors at its discretion.

In August 2009, the Board of Directors determined that there
    would be no new participants in the SERP subsequent to
    August 5, 2009, except for any corporate officers who may
    be appointed to the Management Committee. The SERP is a defined
    benefit arrangement which provides a benefit equal to
    60 percent of

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

covered compensation under which benefits paid from the
    underlying qualified defined benefit plan are an offset to the
    benefits under the SERP. However, the Board also established a
    new defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan (the
    2009 SERP), effective August 5, 2009, with each participant
    being selected by the Board, with each such participant being
    either (i) a corporate officer (other than such officer who
    is appointed as a member of the Company’s Management
    Committee), (ii) a division president or (iii) an
    employee selected in the discretion of the Board. Under the 2009
    SERP, a nominal account has been established for each
    participant, to which the Company contributes at the end of each
    calendar year an amount equal to ten percent of the total of
    each participant’s base salary and cash incentive
    compensation earned during each prior calendar year, beginning
    December 31, 2009. The benefits vest after three years of
    service and attainment of age 55 and earn interest credits
    at the same annual rate as the Company’s Pension Account
    Plan (currently 4.69%).

Similar to our employee pension plans, we review the estimates
    and assumptions underlying our supplemental executive benefit
    plans annually based upon a September 30 measurement date using
    the same techniques as our employee pension plans. The actuarial
    assumptions used to determine the pension liability for the
    supplemental plans were determined as of September 30, 2011
    and 2010 and the actuarial assumptions used to determine the net
    periodic pension cost for the supplemental plans were determined
    as of September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008. These assumptions

Postretirement
    Benefits

We sponsor the Retiree Medical Plan for Retirees and Disabled
    Employees of Atmos Energy Corporation (the Atmos Retiree Medical
    Plan). This plan provides medical and prescription drug
    protection to all qualified participants based on their date of
    retirement. The Atmos Retiree Medical Plan provides different
    levels of benefits depending on the level of coverage chosen by
    the participants and the terms of predecessor plans; however, we
    generally pay 80 percent of the projected net claims and
    administrative costs and participants pay the remaining
    20 percent of this cost.

As of September 30, 2009, the Board of Directors approved a
    change to the cost sharing methodology for employees who had not
    met the participation requirements by that date for the Atmos
    Retiree Medical Plan. Starting on January 1, 2015, the
    contribution rates that will apply to all non-grandfathered
    participants will be determined using a new cost sharing
    methodology by which Atmos Energy will limit its contribution to
    a three percent cost increase in claims and administrative costs
    each year. If medical costs covered by the Atmos Retiree Medical
    Plan increase more than three percent annually, participants
    will be responsible for the additional cost.

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an
    amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. However, additional
    voluntary contributions are made annually as considered
    necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for
    benefits attributed to service to date but also for those
    expected to be earned in the future. We expect to contribute
    $31.5 million to our postretirement benefits plan during
    fiscal 2012.

We maintain a formal investment policy with respect to the
    assets in our postretirement benefits plan to ensure the assets
    funding the postretirement benefit plan are appropriately
    invested to maintain an acceptable level of risk. We also
    consider our current financial status when making
    recommendations and decisions regarding the postretirement
    benefits plan.

We currently invest the assets funding our postretirement
    benefit plan in diversified investment funds which consist of
    common stocks, preferred stocks and fixed income securities. The
    diversified investment funds may invest up to 75 percent of
    assets in common stocks and convertible securities. The
    following table presents asset allocation information for the
    postretirement benefit plan assets as of September 30, 2011

Defined
    Contribution Plans

As of September 30, 2011, we maintained three defined
    contribution benefit plans: the Atmos Energy Corporation
    Retirement Savings Plan and Trust (the Retirement Savings Plan),
    the Atmos Energy Corporation Savings Plan for MVG Union
    Employees (the Union 401K Plan) and the Atmos Energy Holdings,
    LLC 401K Profit-Sharing Plan (the AEH 401K Profit-Sharing Plan).

The Retirement Savings Plan covers substantially all employees
    in our regulated operations and is subject to the provisions of
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Effective
    January 1, 2007, employees automatically became
    participants of the Retirement Savings Plan on the date of
    employment. Participants may elect a salary reduction ranging
    from a minimum of one percent up to a maximum of 65 percent
    of eligible compensation, as defined by the Plan, not to exceed
    the maximum allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. New
    participants are automatically enrolled in the Plan at a salary
    reduction amount of four percent of eligible compensation, from
    which they may opt out. We match 100 percent of a
    participant’s contributions, limited to four percent of the
    participant’s salary, in our common stock. However,
    participants have the option to immediately transfer this
    matching contribution into other funds held within the plan.
    Participants are eligible to receive matching contributions
    after completing one year of service. Participants are also
    permitted to take out loans against their accounts subject to
    certain restrictions. In August 2010, the Board of Directors of
    Atmos Energy approved a proposal to close the Pension Account
    Plan to new participants effective October 1, 2010. New
    employees participate in our defined contribution plan, which
    was enhanced, effective January 1, 2011. Employees
    participating in the Pension Account Plan as of October 1,
    2010 were allowed to make a one-time election to migrate from
    the Plan into our defined contribution plan, effective
    January 1, 2011. Under the enhanced plan, participants will
    receive a fixed annual contribution of four percent of eligible
    earnings to their Retirement Savings Plan account. Participants
    will continue to be eligible for company

matching contributions of up to four percent of their eligible
    earnings and will be fully vested in the fixed annual
    contribution after three years of service.

The Union 401K Plan covers substantially all Mississippi
    Division employees who are members of the International Chemical
    Workers Union Council, United Food and Commercial Workers Union
    International (the Union) and is subject to the provisions of
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees of
    the Union automatically become participants of the Union 401K
    plan on the date of union membership. We match 50 percent
    of a participant’s contribution in cash, limited to six
    percent of the participant’s eligible contribution.
    Participants are also permitted to take out loans against their
    accounts subject to certain restrictions.

Matching contributions to the Retirement Savings Plan and the
    Union 401K Plan are expensed as incurred and amounted to
    $10.2 million, $9.8 million, and $9.3 million for
    fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009. The Board of Directors may
    also approve discretionary contributions, subject to the
    provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and applicable
    regulations of the Internal Revenue Service. No discretionary
    contributions were made for fiscal years 2011, 2010 or 2009. At
    September 30, 2011 and 2010, the Retirement Savings Plan
    held 4.5 percent and 4.3 percent of our outstanding
    common stock.

The AEH 401K Profit-Sharing Plan covers substantially all AEH
    employees and is subject to the provisions of
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participants
    may elect a salary reduction ranging from a minimum of one
    percent up to a maximum of 75 percent of eligible
    compensation, as defined by the Plan, not to exceed the maximum
    allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company may elect
    to make safe harbor contributions up to four percent of the
    employee’s salary which vest immediately. The Company may
    also make discretionary profit sharing contributions to the AEH
    401K Profit-Sharing Plan. Participants become fully vested in
    the discretionary profit-sharing contributions after three years
    of service. Participants are also permitted to take out loans
    against their accounts subject to certain restrictions.
    Discretionary contributions to the AEH 401K Profit-Sharing Plan
    are expensed as incurred and amounted to $1.3 million,
    $1.3 million and $1.2 million for fiscal years 2011,

Earnings
    Per Share

Since we have non-vested share-based payments with a
    nonforfeitable right to dividends or dividend equivalents
    (referred to as participating securities) we are required to use
    the two-class method of computing earnings per share. The
    Company’s non-vested restricted stock and restricted stock
    units, granted under the LTIP, for which vesting is predicated
    solely on the passage of time, are considered to be
    participating securities. The calculation of earnings per share
    using the two-class method excludes income attributable to these
    participating securities from the numerator and excludes the
    dilutive impact of those shares from the denominator.

Basic and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal years ended
    September 30 are calculated as follows:

At September 30, 2010, we had accrued liabilities
    associated with uncertain tax positions totaling
    $6.7 million. During the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2011, the IRS completed its audit of fiscal
    years

2005-2007.

All uncertain tax positions were effectively settled upon
    completion of the audit. As a result of the settlement, we
    reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $6.7 million in
    the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Income tax expense was
    reduced by $5.0 million in the second quarter due to the
    realization of the tax positions which were previously
    uncertain. As of September 30, 2011, we had no liabilities
    associated with uncertain tax positions.

We recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax
    benefits as a component of interest expense. We recognize
    penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of
    miscellaneous income (expense) in accordance with regulatory
    requirements. We recognized a tax expense of $0.01 million,
    $0.5 million and $0.1 million related to penalty and
    interest expenses during the fiscal years ended
    September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction
    as well as in various states where we have operations. We have
    concluded substantially all U.S. federal income tax matters
    through fiscal year 2007.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Litigation

Since April 2009, Atmos Energy and two subsidiaries of AEH, AEM
    and Atmos Gathering Company, LLC (AGC) (collectively, the Atmos
    Entities), have been involved in a lawsuit filed in the Circuit
    Court of Edmonson County, Kentucky related to our Park City
    Gathering Project. The dispute which gave rise to the litigation
    involves the amount of royalties due from a third party producer
    to landowners (who own the mineral rights) for natural gas
    produced from the landowners’ properties. The third party
    producer was operating pursuant to leases between the landowners
    and certain investors/working interest owners. The third party
    producer filed a petition in bankruptcy, which was subsequently
    dismissed due to the lack of meaningful assets to reorganize or
    liquidate.

Although certain Atmos Energy companies entered into contracts
    with the third party producer to gather, treat and ultimately
    sell natural gas produced from the landowners’ properties,
    no Atmos Energy company had a contractual relationship with the
    landowners or the investors/working interest owners. After the
    lawsuit was filed, the landowners were successful in terminating
    for non-payment of royalties the leases related to the
    production of natural gas from their properties. Subsequent to
    termination, the investors/working interest owners under such
    leases filed additional claims against us for the termination of
    the leases.

During the trial, the landowners and the investors/working
    interest owners requested an award of compensatory damages plus
    punitive damages against us. On December 17, 2010, the jury
    returned a verdict in favor of the landowners and
    investor/working interest owners and awarded compensatory
    damages of $3.8 million and punitive damages of
    $27.5 million payable by Atmos Energy and the two AEH
    subsidiaries.

A hearing was held on February 28, 2011 to hear a number of
    motions, including a motion to dismiss the jury verdict and a
    motion for a new trial. The motions to dismiss the jury verdict
    and for a new trial were denied. However, the total punitive
    damages award was reduced from $27.5 million to
    $24.7 million. On March 30, 2011, we filed a notice of
    appeal of this ruling. We strongly believe that the trial court
    erred in not granting our motion to dismiss the lawsuit prior to
    trial and that the verdict is unsupported by law. After
    consultation with counsel, we believe that it is probable that
    any judgment based on this verdict will be overturned on appeal.

In addition, in a related development, on July 12, 2011,
    the Atmos Entities filed a lawsuit in the United States District
    Court, Western District of Kentucky against the third party
    producer and its affiliates to recover all costs, including
    attorneys’ fees, incurred by the Atmos Entities, which are
    associated with the defense and



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

appeal of the case discussed above as well as for all damages
    awarded to the plaintiffs in such case against the Atmos
    Entities. The total amount of damages being claimed in the
    lawsuit is “open-ended” since the appellate process
    and related costs are ongoing. This lawsuit is based upon the
    indemnification provisions agreed to by the third party producer
    in favor of Atmos Gathering that are contained in an agreement
    entered into between Atmos Gathering and the third party
    producer in May 2009.

We have accrued what we believe is an adequate amount for the
    anticipated resolution of this matter; however, the amount
    accrued is less than the amount of the verdict. The Company does
    not have insurance coverage that could mitigate any losses that
    may arise from the resolution of this matter; however, we
    believe that the final outcome will not have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
    flows.

We are a party to other litigation and claims that have arisen
    in the ordinary course of our business. While the results of
    such litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty,
    we believe the final outcome of such litigation and claims will
    not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flows.

Environmental
    Matters

Former
    Manufactured Gas Plant Sites

We are the owner or previous owner of former manufactured gas
    plant sites in Johnson City, Tennessee, Keokuk, Iowa and
    Owensboro, Kentucky, which were used to supply gas prior to the
    availability of natural gas. The gas manufacturing process
    resulted in certain byproducts and residual materials, including
    coal tar. The manufacturing process used by our predecessors was
    an acceptable and satisfactory process at the time such
    operations were being conducted. We have taken removal actions
    with respect to the sites that have been approved by the
    applicable regulatory authorities in Tennessee, Iowa, Kentucky
    and the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

We are a party to other environmental matters and claims that
    have arisen in the ordinary course of our business. While the
    ultimate results of response actions to these environmental
    matters and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we
    believe the final outcome of such response actions will not have
    a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations or cash flows because we believe that the
    expenditures related to such response actions will either be
    recovered through rates, shared with other parties or are
    adequately covered by insurance.

Purchase
    Commitments

AEH has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural
    gas under contracts indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed
    price contracts. At September 30, 2011, AEH was committed
    to purchase 103.3 Bcf within one year, 46.4 Bcf within
    one to three years and 0.9 Bcf after three years under
    indexed contracts. AEH is committed to purchase 4.2 Bcf
    within one year and 0.3 Bcf within one to three years under
    fixed price contracts with prices ranging from $3.49 to $6.36
    per Mcf. Purchases under these contracts totaled
    $1,498.6 million, $1,562.8 million and
    $1,484.5 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Our natural gas distribution divisions, except for our Mid-Tex
    Division, maintain supply contracts with several vendors that
    generally cover a period of up to one year. Commitments for
    estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts
    on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices.
    Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as
    necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the
    individual contract.

Other
    Contingencies

In December 2007, the Company received data requests from the
    Division of Investigations of the Office of Enforcement of the
    Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the
    “Commission”) in connection with its investigation
    into possible violations of the Commission’s posting and
    competitive bidding regulations for pre-arranged released firm
    capacity on natural gas pipelines.

Since that time, we have fully cooperated with FERC during this
    investigation. In August 2011, the FERC issued a Notice of
    Alleged Violations stating that it preliminarily determined that
    Atmos Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries, Atmos Energy
    Marketing, LLC (AEM) and Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline, Inc.
    (TLGP) violated Sections 284.8(h)(2) and 1c.1 of the
    Commission’s regulations through flipping and AEM violated
    the Commission’s shipper-must-have-title requirement and
    the associated FERC gas tariffs of various pipelines.

The Company and FERC are currently involved in settlement
    discussions. We have accrued what we believe is an adequate
    amount for the anticipated resolution of this matter.

We have been replacing certain steel service lines in our
    Mid-Tex Division since our acquisition of the natural gas
    distribution system in 2004. Since early 2010, we have been
    discussing the financial and operational details of an
    accelerated steel service line replacement program with
    representatives of 440 municipalities served by our Mid-Tex
    Division. As previously discussed in Note 12 to the
    consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, all of the
    cities in our Mid-Tex Division have agreed to a program of
    installing 100,000 replacements during the next fiscal year,
    with approved recovery of the associated return, depreciation
    and taxes. Under the terms of the agreement, the accelerated
    replacement program commenced in the first quarter of fiscal
    2011, replacing

35,852 lines for a cost of $49.7 million as of
    September 30, 2011. The program is progressing on schedule
    for completion in September 2012.

In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, representing an
    extensive overhaul of the framework for regulation of
    U.S. financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act calls for
    various regulatory agencies, including the SEC and the
    Commodities Futures Trading Commission, to establish regulations
    for implementation of many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank
    Act, which we expect will provide additional clarity regarding
    the extent of the impact of this legislation on us. The costs of
    participating in financial markets for hedging certain risks
    inherent in our business may be increased as a result of the new
    legislation. We may also incur additional costs associated with
    compliance with new regulations and anticipate additional
    reporting and disclosure obligations.

We have entered into non-cancelable operating leases for office
    and warehouse space used in our operations. The remaining lease
    terms range from one to 21 years and generally provide for
    the payment of taxes, insurance and maintenance by the lessee.
    Renewal options exist for certain of these leases. We have also
    entered into capital leases for division offices and operating
    facilities. Property, plant and equipment included amounts for
    capital leases of $1.3 and $1.3 million at
    September 30, 2011 and 2010. Accumulated depreciation for
    these capital leases totaled $0.9 and $0.8 million at
    September 30, 2011 and 2010. Depreciation expense for these
    assets is included in consolidated depreciation expense on the
    consolidated statement of income.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to us if a customer
    fails to perform its contractual obligations. We engage in
    transactions for the purchase and sale of products and services
    with major companies in the energy industry and with industrial,
    commercial, residential and municipal energy consumers. These
    transactions principally occur in the southern and midwestern
    regions of the United States. We believe that this geographic
    concentration does not contribute significantly to our overall
    exposure to credit risk. Credit risk associated with trade
    accounts receivable for the natural gas distribution segment is
    mitigated by the large number of individual customers and
    diversity in our customer base. The credit risk for our other
    segments is not significant.

Customer diversification also helps mitigate AEM’s exposure
    to credit risk. AEM maintains credit policies with respect to
    its counterparties that it believes minimizes overall credit
    risk. Where appropriate, such policies include the evaluation of
    a prospective counterparty’s financial condition,
    collateral requirements, primarily consisting of letters of
    credit, and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate
    the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty.
    AEM also monitors the financial condition of existing
    counterparties on an ongoing basis. Customers not meeting
    minimum standards are required to provide adequate assurance of
    financial performance.

AEM maintains a provision for credit losses based upon factors
    surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends,
    consideration of the current credit environment and other
    information. We believe, based on our credit policies and our
    provisions for credit losses as of September 30, 2011, that
    our financial position, results of operations and cash flows
    will not be materially affected as a result of nonperformance by
    any single counterparty.

AEM’s estimated credit exposure is monitored in terms of
    the percentage of its customers, including affiliate customers
    that are rated as investment grade versus non-investment grade.
    Credit exposure is defined as the total of (1) accounts
    receivable, (2) delivered, but unbilled physical sales and

(3) mark-to-market

exposure for sales and purchases. Investment grade
    determinations are set internally by AEM’s credit
    department, but are primarily based on external ratings provided
    by Moody’s Investors Service Inc. (Moody’s)

and/or

Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P). For
    non-rated entities, the default rating for municipalities is
    investment grade, while the default rating for non-guaranteed
    industrials and commercials is non-investment

grade. Customers who have a non-investment grade but provide
    either a letter of credit or prepay their monthly invoice have
    been included as investment grade. The following table shows the
    percentages related to the investment ratings as of
    September 30, 2011 and 2010.

The following table presents our financial instrument
    counterparty credit exposure by operating segment based upon the
    unrealized fair value of our financial instruments that
    represent assets as of September 30, 2011. Investment grade
    counterparties have minimum credit ratings of BBB-, assigned by
    S&P; or Baa3, assigned by Moody’s. Non-investment
    grade counterparties are composed of counterparties that are
    below investment grade or that have not been assigned an
    internal investment grade rating due to the short-term nature of
    the contracts associated with that counterparty. This category
    is composed of numerous smaller counterparties, none of which is
    individually significant.

Segment
    Information

Atmos Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries are engaged
    primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution,
    transmission and storage business as well as other nonregulated
    businesses. We distribute natural gas through sales and
    transportation arrangements to over three million residential,
    commercial, public authority and industrial customers through
    our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions, which
    cover service areas located in 12 states. In addition, we
    transport natural gas for others through our distribution system.

Through our nonregulated businesses, we primarily provide
    natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities,
    other local distribution companies and industrial customers
    primarily in the Midwest

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and Southeast. Additionally, we provide natural gas
    transportation and storage services to certain of our natural
    gas distribution operations and to third parties.

Through November 30, 2010, our operations were divided into
    four segments:

•

The

natural gas distribution segment

, which included our
    regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations.

•

The

regulated transmission and storage segment

, which
    included the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our
    Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division.

•

The

natural gas marketing segment

, which included a
    variety of nonregulated natural gas management services.

•

The

pipeline, storage and other segment

, which included
    our nonregulated natural gas gathering transmission and storage
    services.

As a result of the appointment of a new CEO effective
    October 1, 2010, during the first quarter of fiscal 2011,
    we revised the information used by the chief operating decision
    maker to manage the Company. As a result of this change,
    effective December 1, 2010, we began dividing our
    operations into the following three segments:

•

The

natural gas distribution segment

, remains unchanged
    and includes our regulated natural gas distribution and related
    sales operations.

•

The

regulated transmission and storage segment

, remains
    unchanged and includes the regulated pipeline and storage
    operations of our Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division.

•

The

nonregulated segment

, is comprised of our
    nonregulated natural gas management, nonregulated natural gas
    transmission, storage and other services which were previously
    reported in the natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and
    other segments.

Our determination of reportable segments considers the strategic
    operating units under which we manage sales of various products
    and services to customers in differing regulatory environments.
    Although our natural gas distribution segment operations are
    geographically dispersed, they are reported as a single segment
    as each natural gas distribution division has similar economic
    characteristics. The accounting policies of the segments are the
    same as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies. We evaluate performance based on net income or loss of
    the respective operating units. Interest expense is allocated
    pro rata to each segment based upon our net investment in each
    segment. Income taxes are allocated to each segment as if each
    segment’s taxes were calculated on a separate return basis.

Summarized unaudited quarterly financial data is presented
    below. Prior-period amounts have been restated to reflect
    continuing operations. The sum of net income per share by
    quarter may not equal the net income per share for the fiscal
    year due to variations in the weighted average shares
    outstanding used in computing such amounts. Our businesses are
    seasonal due to weather conditions in our service areas. For
    further information on its effects on quarterly results, see the

Controls
    and Procedures.

Management’s
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer, of the
    effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures, as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange
    Act). Based on this evaluation, the Company’s principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded
    that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective as of September 30, 2011 to provide reasonable
    assurance that information required to be disclosed by us,
    including our consolidated entities, in the reports that we file
    or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by
    the SEC’s rules and forms, including a reasonable level of
    assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated
    to our management, including our principal executive and
    principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f),

in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting based on the framework in

Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework

issued by COSO and applicable
    Securities and Exchange Commission rules, our management
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of September 30, 2011, in providing reasonable
    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
    the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Ernst & Young LLP has issued its report on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Atmos Energy Corporation

We have audited Atmos Energy Corporation’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of September 30, 2011, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Atmos Energy
    Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Atmos Energy Corporation maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of September 30, 2011, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2011 and
    2010, and the related statements of income, shareholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended September 30, 2011 of Atmos Energy Corporation and
    our report dated November 22, 2011 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.
