                              PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

     Atmos Energy Corporation (the "Company") was organized under
the laws of the State of Texas in 1983 as a subsidiary of Pioneer
Corporation ("Pioneer") for the purposes of owning and operating
Pioneer's natural gas distribution business in Texas.  Immediate-
ly following the transfer of such business, which had been opera-
ted by Pioneer and its predecessors since 1906, Pioneer distrib-
uted the outstanding stock of the Company, then known as Energas
Company, to Pioneer shareholders.  In September 1988, the Company
changed its name from Energas Company to Atmos Energy
Corporation.

     The Company distributes and sells natural gas to
residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and other
customers in 413 cities, towns, and communities in parts of
Texas, Louisiana, Kentucky, Colorado, Kansas, and Missouri.  The
Company also transports gas for others through parts of its
distribution system.  The Company is also helping promote the
development of a market for natural gas as a clean burning
vehicular fuel by opening four public refueling facilities in its
service areas.

     The Company's Texas distribution system is operated through
its Energas Company division (the "Energas Division") and is
located in the western part of Texas covering an area having a
population of approximately 950,000 people.  The economy of the
area is based primarily on oil and gas production and agricul-
ture.  The principal  cities served by the Energas Division
include Amarillo, Lubbock, Midland, and Odessa.  At September 30,
1994, the Company had 309,496 gas meters in service in Texas.

     The Company's Louisiana distribution system is operated
through its Trans Louisiana Gas Company division (the "Trans La
Division") and is located in Louisiana covering an area having a
population of approximately 250,000 people.  The economy of the
area is based primarily on oil and gas production, agriculture,
and food processing.  The principal cities served by the Trans La
Division are Lafayette, Pineville, and Natchitoches.  At
September 30, 1994, the Company had 70,361 gas meters in service
in Louisiana.

     The Company's Kentucky distribution system is operated
through its Western Kentucky Gas Company division (the "Western
Kentucky Division") and covers an area having a population of
approximately 680,000 people.  The economy of the area is based
primarily on industry and agriculture.  The principal cities
served by the Western Kentucky Division include Bowling Green,
Owensboro, and Paducah.  At September 30, 1994, the Company had
164,828 gas meters in service in Kentucky.

     In December 1993, the Company acquired Greeley Gas Company
("GGC") of Denver, Colorado in a merger accounted for as a pool-






ing of interests, and accordingly, all amounts included herein
have been restated to include GGC's operating results.  Since the
merger, the business of GGC has been operated through the
Company's Greeley Gas Company division (the "Greeley Gas
Division").  It serves customers in areas of Colorado, Kansas,
and Missouri having a combined population of approximately
228,000 people.  The economies of the areas served are based on
oil and gas production, agriculture and resort business in
Colorado.  The principal cities served include Greeley, Durango
and Lamar, Colorado and Bonner Springs, Herington and Ulysses,
Kansas.  At September 30, 1994 the Greeley Gas Division had
104,634 meters in service.

     The natural gas distribution industry is subject to numerous
special factors, many of which affect the Company from time to
time.  These include (i) adequate and timely rate relief from
regulatory authorities to recover costs of service and earn a
fair return on invested capital; (ii) inherent seasonality of the
business in local gas distribution service areas; (iii)
competition from alternate fuels; (iv) competition with other gas
sources for industrial customers, including bypass of the
Company's facilities, which could result in loss of revenues and
reduction in the Company's net income; and (v) possible
volatility in the supply and price of natural gas.

ACQUISITIONS

     Since its organization in 1983, the Company has sought to
expand its customer base and to diversify the weather patterns,
local economic conditions, and regulatory environments to which
its operations are subject.  As part of this strategy, the
Company acquired Trans Louisiana Gas Company, Inc. ("TLG") in
January 1986, Western Kentucky Gas Utility Corporation ("WKG") in
December 1987, and Greeley Gas Company ("GGC") in December 1993.  
The Company continues to consider and pursue, where appropriate,
additional acquisitions of natural gas distribution properties
and other business opportunities.  For further information
regarding the GGC merger, see Note 2 of notes to consolidated
financial statements, and Management's Discussion and Analysis.

FIVE-YEAR OPERATING STATISTICS

     Certain information with respect to the Company's natural
gas operations for the past five years is shown on the following
page.











 

 












































 




 



 





GAS SALES

     The Company's natural gas distribution business is seasonal and highly
dependent on weather conditions in the Company's service areas.  Gas sales
to residential and commercial customers are greater during the winter
months than during the remainder of the year.  The volumes of such sales
during the winter months will vary with the temperatures during such
months.  The seasonal nature of the Company's sales to residential and
commercial customers is offset partially by the Company's sales in the
spring and summer months to its agricultural customers in Texas and Kansas
who utilize natural gas to operate irrigation equipment.  The Company's
management believes that the Company has lessened its sensitivity to
weather risk by diversifying its operations into geographic areas having
different weather patterns.

     The Company's revenues are affected by the cost of natural gas,
economic conditions in the areas that the Company serves, and weather
conditions.  Higher gas costs, which the Company is generally able to pass
through to its customers under purchased gas adjustment clauses, may cause
customers to conserve, or, in the case of industrial customers, to use
alternative energy sources.  

     In recent years, excess supply in the natural gas market has led to a
decline in natural gas prices and an increase in the number of competing
marketers of natural gas to large volume users.  In order to compete with
these marketers, the Company's three gas marketing subsidiaries purchase
gas for resale to various large volume customers.

     In certain instances, industrial customers purchase gas directly from
other marketers or from one of the Company's gas marketing subsidiaries,
and the Company transports such gas through its distribution systems to the
customers' facilities for a fee.  Transportation of customer-owned gas that
otherwise would have been sold by the Company reduces the Company's
operating revenues and corresponding purchased gas cost.  However, the
transportation fees received by the Company may offset the loss of gross
profit that would have been realized had the Company sold such gas to such
customers.  

     The Company's distribution systems have experienced aggregate peak day
deliveries of approximately 1 billion cubic feet ("Bcf") per day.  The
Company has the ability to curtail deliveries to certain interruptible
customers under the terms of contracts and applicable state statutes or
regulations which enables it to maintain its deliveries to high priority
customers.  The Company has not imposed curtailment in its Energas Division
since the Company began independent operations in 1983 or in its Trans La
Division since the Company acquired TLG in 1986.  The Western Kentucky
Division curtailed deliveries to certain interruptible customers during
exceptionally cold periods in December 1989 and January 1994.  GGC has not
curtailed deliveries to its sales customers since prior to 1980.  

GAS SUPPLY     

     The principal gas suppliers to the Company in 1994, 1993 and 1992
included Westar Transmission Company ("Westar"), an affiliate of KNEnergy;
Anthem Energy Company, L.P. ("Anthem") an affiliate of KNEnergy; Mesa






Operating Company ("Mesa"); Louisiana Intrastate Gas Corporation ("LIG"),
an affiliate of Equitable Resources Inc.; Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company
("Tennessee Gas"), an affiliate of Tenneco, Inc.; Texas Gas Transmission
Corporation ("Texas Gas"), an affiliate of Transco; Texaco Gas Marketing;
Union Pacific Fuels; Vastar, an affiliate of ARCO; Associated Natural Gas,
Inc. ("ANGI"); and Rangeline Corporation ("Rangeline"), an affiliate of
Astra Resources.  The prices paid by the Company for natural gas delivered
to it are set by contracts with gas suppliers and/or ratemaking proceedings
before regulatory authorities.  Charges for gas costs are passed through to
the Company's customers under approved or negotiated tariffs or pursuant to
contract.










 





     The following table sets forth volumes purchased from the Company's
principal gas suppliers for the years ended September 30, 1994, 1993, and

  Associated Natural Gas, Inc.            3,049
  Rangeline Corporation                   1,295


     Westar and Anthem supply natural gas to most of the Energas Division
under multiple contracts. The Westar contract expires in 1998.  The Anthem
contracts are renegotiated annually.  Westar purchases gas from various
pipeline companies and natural gas processing plants and at the wellhead. 
Westar's gas price to the Company is subject to an annual adjustment in
accordance with the existing contract.  Under the Westar contract, the
Company has the right annually to elect to buy up to 20% of its monthly re-
quirements for its Energas Division from other suppliers. 

     The principal gas supply for the Company's Amarillo, Texas
distribution system is furnished by Mesa under a long-term contract that
expires upon the depletion of the field from which the gas is produced. 
Mesa owns the gas rights in certain specified acreage in the West Panhandle
field.  Pursuant to a contract between Colorado Interstate Gas Company
("CIG") and Mesa, CIG is obligated to deliver to Mesa the volumes of gas
required for sale to customers in Amarillo and its environs, subject to
certain contractual volume limitations, so long as the gas reserves from
the West Panhandle field are commercially producible.  In June 1992, the
Company renegotiated the pricing provisions of its primary gas supply






contract for the Amarillo, Texas distribution system.  The contract calls
for a pricing formula which determines the prices the Company pays each
year during the five year period that began January 1, 1993.  The contract
also provides a mechanism for price redetermination each two year period
thereafter beginning January 1, 1998.  

     On October 28, 1991, the Company and LIG entered into new agreements
which were approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission ("Louisiana
Commission") on November 26, 1991, and became effective June 1, 1992. 
These agreements provide continued supply by LIG for most of the Trans La
Division's gas requirements for a term of ten years (but subject to
cancellation by either party after five years).  The agreements provide for
market sensitive pricing and allow the Company to purchase certain volumes
of gas from other suppliers.  Under the contract, the Trans La Division has
the right to purchase a portion of its requirements from suppliers other
than LIG at market sensitive prices.  At the end of the second contract
year, the Trans La Division had the right to increase its purchases from
others up to approximately 45% of its requirements which right was
exercised by Trans La.  LIG is required to provide standby service to back
up the purchases from the other suppliers.

     The Company purchases some gas supplies for resale to certain of its
Louisiana industrial customers from suppliers other than LIG.  The
Company's Louisiana industrial sales subsidiary, Trans Louisiana Industrial
Gas Company, Inc., has entered into supply contracts at market sensitive
prices with Enron Gas Services, Inc. for the major portion of its
requirements, with the remainder being purchased under 30-day contracts
from other suppliers.  Gas provided by these suppliers is transported by
LIG with delivery into the Trans La Division's system.

     The Western Kentucky Division transports its natural gas requirements
through firm transportation agreements with Texas Gas and Tennessee Gas
with the exception of a small percentage of the requirements being
purchased directly from intrastate producers.  The Western Kentucky
Division purchases its supply under staggered term contracts from major
producers and marketers including Texaco, Union Pacific, Vastar, Associated
Natural, Hadson and Chevron.

     The Company's distribution system in the Western Kentucky Division
includes six underground storage facilities, which are used to help meet
customer requirements during peak demand periods and to reduce the need to
contract additional pipeline volumes to meet such peak demand periods.  See
"Item 2. Properties" for further information regarding the underground
storage facilities.  The Company has also bought gas in underground storage
facilities of Tennessee Gas in Louisiana and Kentucky under FERC Order 636.

     The Greeley Gas Division purchases or transports approximately 72% of
its natural gas requirements on eight pipelines.  Five of these are
regulated by the FERC and the remaining three are state regulated.  The
FERC pipelines are Colorado Interstate Gas Company, Williams Natural Gas
Company, KNEnergy, Northwest Pipeline Corporation, and NorAm.  The state
regulated pipelines are Public Service Company of Colorado, KPL Gas Service
Company and Kansas Pipeline Partnership in Kansas.  Approximately 28% of
the Divisions's gas supply is purchased from local sources.  Several of the
operating areas are in or adjacent to natural gas producing fields.







     Each of the Greeley Gas Division's operating areas is connected to one
of the pipeline suppliers so that gas prices can be managed by using any of
three sources: pipeline purchase, pipeline transport, or local purchases.  

     Associated Natural Gas, Inc. is the main supplier to the Greeley Gas
Division's largest district, the Greeley District.  There are two contracts
with ANGI - one contract for fixed-price base load gas put directly into
the Greeley Gas Division distribution system from natural gas processing
plants, and one contract for monthly market-sensitive spot purchases.

     Rangeline is the principal gas supplier for the Kansas and Missouri
districts.  Gas is transported through three different pipeline systems
(Williams Natural Gas, KPL, and NorAm).  The contract with Rangeline for
gas transported through Williams Natural Gas expires in October 1996, the
contract for the KPL transported gas expires in August 1996, and the
contract for the NorAm transported gas is monthly.  The contracts with
Rangeline provide for market-sensitive pricing.

     The Company has not experienced curtailment in its Texas distribution
system since it began independent operations in 1983, in its Louisiana
system since its acquisition, or in Colorado, Kansas or Missouri since
prior to 1980.  A large proportion of the Company's sales are made to high
priority residential and commercial consumers; therefore, any curtailment
of supply for these customers is unlikely.  However, the distribution
system in Kentucky has occasionally interrupted contractually interruptible
industrial and large volume commercial customers.  The most recent
interruption for these Kentucky customers was in January 1994. 

REGULATION AND RATES 

     Regulation.  In the Energas Division, the governing body of each
municipality served by the Company has original jurisdiction over all
utility rates, operations, and services within its city limits except with
respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel and agricultural use.  The
Company operates pursuant to non-exclusive franchises granted by the
municipalities it serves, which franchises are subject to renewal from time
to time.  The franchises granted to the Company permit it to conduct
natural gas distribution within the municipalities' incorporated limits. 
The Railroad Commission of Texas ("Railroad Commission") has exclusive
appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory orders and ordinances
of the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates and
services to customers not located within the limits of a municipality.  In
Texas, rates for large industrial customers are routinely set by contract
negotiation between the Company and industrial customers pursuant to
statutory standards and are filed with and subject to the governmental
authority of the municipalities or the Railroad Commission, depending on
whether the customer is located inside or outside the limits of a
municipality.  Historically, the Company's rates for large industrial
customers have been accepted as filed.  Agricultural sales in Texas are not
regulated, except that prices for agricultural sales cannot exceed the
prices the Company charges the majority of its commercial or other similar
large-volume users in Texas.

     The operations of the Trans La Division are under the jurisdiction of
the Louisiana Public Service Commission, which regulates utility services,






rates, and other matters.  In most of the parishes and incorporated areas
in which the Company operates in Louisiana, it does so pursuant to a non-
exclusive franchise granted by the governing authority of each parish or
incorporated area.  The franchise gives the Company the general privilege
to operate its gas distribution business in, as well as the right to
install its distribution lines along the roadways of, the parish or the
incorporated area.  Direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers in
Louisiana who utilize the gas for fuel or in manufacturing processes and
sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel are exempt from regulation. 

     The operations of the Western Kentucky Division are under the
jurisdiction of the Kentucky Public Service Commission, which regulates
utility services, rates, issuances of securities, and other matters.  The
Company operates in the various incorporated cities served by it in
Kentucky pursuant to non-exclusive franchises granted by such cities.  The
franchises grant to the Company the right to operate its gas distribution
business in the city and to install its distribution lines and related
equipment in and along the city's public rights-of-way.  Sales of natural
gas for use as vehicle fuel in Kentucky are not subject to regulation.

     The Greeley Gas Division is subject to the regulatory authority of the
Colorado Public Utilities Commission, the Kansas Corporation Commission,
and the Missouri Public Service Commission with respect to accounting,
rates and charges, operating matters, and the issuance of securities.  The
Company operates in the various incorporated cities served by it in the
states of Colorado, Kansas and Missouri under terms of non-exclusive
franchises granted by the various cities.  The franchises grant to the
Company, among other things, the right to install and operate its gas
distribution system within the city limits.  Most of the Greeley Gas
Division's wholesale gas suppliers are regulated by various federal and
state commissions.

     The Company is subject to regulation by the United States Department
of Transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and
maintenance of its gas distribution facilities.  The Company's distribution
operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating
environmental matters.  From time to time the Company receives inquiries
regarding various environmental matters.  The Company believes that its
properties and operations substantially comply with and are operated in
substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental statutes
and regulations.  There are no administrative or judicial proceedings
arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be
contemplated by governmental agencies which, if adversely determined, would
have a material adverse effect on the Company.

     Rates.  Approximately 87% of the Company's revenues in fiscal 1994 was
derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state
authorities.  The method of determining regulated rates varies among the
six states in which the Company operates.  Generally, the Company applies
for a specific rate structure based upon requirements of the regulatory
authority.  The regulatory authority reviews the Company's rate request and
establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to
cover the Company's costs of doing business and a reasonable return on
invested capital.  The Company has not always agreed with its regulators'
decisions on its rate filings and has pursued the appeal and rehearing






procedures in Texas in 1985 and 1992 and in Kentucky in 1991. The Company
also continually reviews its rates in all of its jurisdictions.

     Substantially all of the sales rates charged by the Company to its
customers fluctuate with the cost of gas purchased by the Company.  Base
rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and
decreases in the Company's purchased gas cost through automatic purchased
gas adjustment mechanisms.  Therefore, while the Company's operating
revenues may fluctuate, gross profit (which is defined as operating
revenues less purchased gas cost) is generally not eroded or enhanced
because of gas cost increases or decreases.

     The following table sets forth the major rate requests made by the
Company and the action taken on such requests:

     service area.  The portion of the rate request for rural customers,
     who represent about 10% of the customers in this service area, is
     pending before the Railroad Commission of Texas.
(b)  The September 1992 rate order provided an additional $800,000 for
     franchise tax expense.  
(c)  The September 1992 rate order also approved a Rate Stabilization
     Clause ("RSC") for three years which provides for an annual adjustment






     of rates to reflect changes in expenses and investment.  The RSC
     provides the Company the opportunity to earn a return on common equity
     between 11.75% and 12.25%. 
(d)  The rate request procedures in Missouri that are applicable to the
     Greeley Gas Division do not require the filing of a formal rate
     request.  The rate increase received is established by the Missouri
     Public Service Commission on the basis of the Greeley Gas Division's
     responses to various data requests from the Commission.  Consequently,
     the Greeley Gas Division did not specify a requested rate increase
     amount.

COMPETITION

     The Company is not currently in significant direct competition with
any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial
customers within its service areas.  However, the Company does compete with
other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternate fuels for sales to
industrial and agricultural customers.

     Beginning in 1985, changes in the federal regulatory environment
through FERC orders and conditions related to markets and gas supply in the
United States have brought increased competition into the natural gas
industry.  In 1992, the FERC issued Order 636 and related clarifying
orders.  These orders provided for further restructuring of interstate
pipeline services and are intended to completely unbundle pipeline trans-
portation and sales functions.  The FERC orders make gas transportation
more accessible to users of large quantities of gas and also reduce
procedural obstacles allowing such users to bypass local distribution
companies, such as the Company, to purchase gas from other suppliers, and
to secure transportation directly from pipeline companies.  The Company has
felt the impact of the competitiveness in the large volume market in some
areas resulting from these changes and has dealt with this by seeking
regulatory approval for competitive pricing on a case by case basis.  The
FERC policies apply only to interstate pipelines and have not had a direct
impact upon the Company's operations which are primarily supplied by
intrastate pipelines.

     The Company competes in all aspects of its business with alternative
energy sources, including, in particular, electricity.  Competition for the
residential and commercial customers is increasing.  Promotional
incentives, improved equipment efficiencies, and promotional rates all
contribute to the acceptability of electric equipment.

     In late 1991, the Company opened four public retail facilities for the
sale of compressed natural gas ("CNG") for vehicular use.  The facilities
are located at existing local gasoline stations.  Prior to that time, the
Company provided CNG for vehicular use only in limited situations (such as
for school buses in certain school districts and for the fleet vehicles of
certain businesses).  With the opening of these public refueling stations
the Company began competing against gasoline for vehicular fuel sales.











Employees

     At September 30, 1994, the Company employed 1,709 persons.  See page 4
for number of employees by state.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     The Company owns an aggregate of 21,927 miles of underground pipelines
throughout its gas distribution systems.  These pipelines are located on
easements or rights-of-way granted to the Company, which generally provide
for perpetual use.  The Company maintains its pipelines through a program
of continuous inspection and repair and believes that the pipeline system
is in good condition.  The Company also owns or operates six underground
gas storage facilities in Kentucky that have a total storage capacity of
approximately 11.7 Bcf.  However, approximately 6.5 Bcf of gas in the
storage facilities must be retained as cushion gas.  The maximum daily
delivery capability of the storage facilities is approximately 112 MMcf.

     Substantially all of the Company's properties in its Greeley Gas
Division with a book value of approximately $59.2 million are subject to a
lien under First Mortgage Bonds assumed by the Company in the acquisition
of GGC.  At September 30, 1994, the lien secured approximately $17.0
million of outstanding 9.4% Series J First Mortgage Bonds due May 1, 2021.

     The Company leases its executive and administrative headquarters in
Dallas, Texas under leases that expire in 1997.  The Company also maintains
field offices throughout its distribution system, substantially all of
which are located in leased premises.  

     The Company holds franchises granted by the incorporated cities and
towns and by each Louisiana parish that it serves.  At September 30, 1994,
the Company held 271 such franchises having terms generally ranging from
five to 25 years.  The Company believes that each of its franchises will be
renewed.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

INTRODUCTION

     The Company distributes and sells natural gas to residential,
commercial, industrial and agricultural customers in six states.  Such
business is subject to federal and state regulation and/or regulation by
local authorities in each of the states in which the Company operates.  In
addition, the Company's business is affected by seasonal weather patterns,
competitive factors within the energy industry, and economic conditions in
the areas that the Company serves.

     A consolidated five-year financial and statistical summary is included
elsewhere herein.

ACQUISITION OF GREELEY GAS COMPANY THROUGH MERGER

     The Company has expanded its customer base and sought to diversify the
regulations, weather patterns and local economic conditions to which it is
subject through acquisitions in 1986 and 1987 and 1993.  The Company
continues to consider and pursue, where appropriate, additional
acquisitions of natural gas distribution properties and other business
opportunities. 

     In December 1993, the Company acquired Greeley Gas Company ("GGC") of
Denver, Colorado in a merger transaction accounted for as a pooling of
interests; therefore, all historical financial statements and notes thereto
have been restated to retroactively reflect this merger.   At that time,
GGC was a privately held company providing natural gas service to nearly
100,000 customers in 122 communities in Colorado, Kansas and a small
service area in Missouri.  The transaction was structured to be a tax-free
reorganization.  The Company exchanged 2,329,330 shares of its common stock
before the 3-for-2 stock split (3,493,995 shares on a post-split basis) for
all of the outstanding stock of GGC.  For further information regarding the
merger, see Note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements.

     The Company believes that, while the merger may result in some
dilution during the short term, it is expected to be non-dilutive over the
long term with respect to earnings per share.  The Company believes this
transaction is consistent with its continuing long-term corporate
development strategy of increasing the value of the Company through
external growth.  The Company believes this acquisition will help to
further diversify both the geographic scope of its markets and the mix of
its customer profile, thereby reducing its exposure to changes in the
economic conditions in any given segment of its service area and will add
to diversification in the areas of weather, regulatory environment, and
economic environment.  Over the longer term, the Company expects this
combination to contribute to the stability and predictability of earnings
and cash flow.











RATE ACTIVITY

     In September 1994, the Company filed to increase revenues by
approximately $2.6 million for a portion of its Energas Company service
area ("Energas Division").  The proposed rates would produce an overall
increase of approximately 1.9% of current annual revenues generated from
approximately 217,000 customers and reflects recovery of accrual accounting
of postretirement benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 106.  See Note 8 of
the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.  In November
1994, the Company implemented an annual revenue increase of approximately
$1.5 million affecting about 90% of the customers in this portion of its
Energas Division.

     GGC filed a request for an increase in annual revenues of $4.5 million
with the Colorado Public Utility Commission ("Colorado Commission") in
September, 1993.  On May 1, 1994, the Company implemented an annual
increase of $3.2 million or 6.9% in Phase I of this proceeding.  The Phase
I rates reflect recovery of  SFAS No. 106 expenses with external funding,
consistent with the recommended decision of the presiding administrative
law judge.  In October 1994, the Colorado Commission issued its order
affirming the increase as set forth in Phase I.  The next step in the rate
proceeding will be Phase II, which will address rate redesign issues. 

     Effective December 1, 1993, GGC received an annual rate increase of
approximately $2.1 million or 10.6% in its Kansas service area.  The
increase reflects SFAS No. 106 expenses with external funding and a
moratorium on rate requests in Kansas until December 1, 1996.

     On February 11, 1992, the Company filed a rate case with the city of
Amarillo, Texas seeking to increase annual revenues by approximately $4.4
million, or 12%.  In November 1992, the Railroad Commission issued its
decision resulting in a total annual increase of $2.1 million.  The Company
and the city requested a rehearing of the Order.  On January 11, 1993, the
Railroad Commission denied rehearing to both parties.  In February 1993,
the city appealed the Railroad Commission's rate order to the District
Court of Travis County, Texas.  In January 1994, the District Court denied
the city's appeal.  The city has appealed to the Court of Appeals.

     During the period of 1991 through 1993, the Company also filed for and
received small rate increases in certain other rate jurisdictions in its
Energas Division totaling approximately $.3 million annually.

     The Company filed for a rate increase with the Louisiana Public
Service Commission (the "Louisiana Commission") in November 1991 for its
Louisiana service area ("Trans La Division").  The proposed rates would
produce approximately $3.4 million per year in additional revenues, or an
overall increase of approximately 9.8% for the Trans La Division. 
Effective September 3, 1992, the Louisiana Commission granted an increase
of approximately $1.0 million per year in additional revenues, or an
overall increase of approximately 2.8%.  The rate order also allowed the
Company to collect franchise taxes as a line item on the Company's bills
which will reduce taxes, other than income taxes, by approximately $800,000
per year.  The rate order also approved a rate stabilization clause for
three years that provides for an annual adjustment to the Company's rates
to reflect changes in expenses, revenues and invested capital following an






annual review.  The rate stabilization clause provides an opportunity for a
return on jurisdictional common equity of between 11.75% and 12.25%.  As a
result of the Company's filings under the rate stabilization clause, an
increase of $730,000 annually or 2% went into effect on March 1, 1993, and
an increase of $1.1 million annually or 2.7% went into effect on March 1,
1994.

     In September 1990, the Kentucky Public Service Commission (the
"Kentucky Commission") issued an order that increased annual revenues
approximately $1.0 million for the Company's Kentucky service area.  In May
1991, the Kentucky Commission issued an Order on Rehearing increasing
allowed revenues an additional $2.6 million.  In connection with this rate
case the Company filed a Notice of Appeal with the Kentucky Court of
Appeals in July 1993. The Company's appeal in Kentucky relates solely to
the determination of the appropriate effective date of its last rate
increase in Kentucky.  The Kentucky Public Service Commission made the
increase effective in May 1991, while the Company believes it should have
become effective in September 1990.  The Company lost the issue at the
trial court level.  If the Company is successful, it could recover
approximately $1 million in additional revenue; if it is unsuccessful,
there would be no impact on its revenue.  Subsequent to September 30, 1994,
the Kentucky Court of Appeals denied the Company's appeal.  The Company is
currently assessing its options for further appeals.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED

     The Company has not adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits". See
Note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements.  The rate treatment
of SFAS No. 112 costs has not been determined at this time.  Such costs are
currently recorded and recovered in rates on the pay-as-you-go basis.  The
Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material
impact on its financial condition or results of operations.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1994 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1993

     Operating revenues increased to $499.8 million in 1994 from $459.6
million in 1993 due to rate increases received in Kansas, Colorado and
Louisiana, an increase in the number of customers, changes in cost of gas
and increased volumes sold.  Average gas sales revenues per thousand cubic
feet ("Mcf") increased from 1993 by $.12 to $4.14 in 1994, while the
average cost of gas per Mcf sold increased $.15 to $2.86 in 1994.  The
number of meters in service increased to 649,319 at September 30, 1994
compared with 636,159 at September 30, 1993.  Although the weather was 2%
warmer in 1994 than in 1993, it was only slightly warmer than normal. 
Sales to residential, commercial and public authority customers decreased
approximately .5 billion cubic feet ("Bcf") in 1994, but sales to
industrial and agricultural customers increased approximately 7 Bcf.  Total
sales volumes increased 6.7 Bcf to 116.1 Bcf in 1994, as compared with
1993.  Revenues from gas transported for others decreased $.9 million to
approximately $14.1 million in fiscal 1994 due to a decrease in volumes
transported of 4.5 Bcf to 35.3 Bcf in 1994. 







     Gross profit increased by approximately 3% to $168.2 million in 1994
from $163.1 million in 1993.  The primary factors contributing to the
higher gross profit were increased prices and volumes, as discussed above. 
Operating expenses, excluding income taxes, increased to $133.7 million in
1994 from $122.8 million in 1993 due to increased operation expense and
depreciation.  Operation expense increased $9.9 million due to increased
distribution expense, employee welfare expenses including adoption of SFAS
No. 106, GGC acquisition and assimilation costs, and the cost of an early
retirement program in the Greeley Gas Division in the fourth quarter.  SFAS
No. 106 expenses in excess of pay-as-you-go expenses were approximately
$3.8 million in 1994.  The Company has been successful in seeking recovery
of SFAS No. 106 expenses in a portion of its service areas and will
continue to seek recovery in its remaining service areas (Note 8).  GGC
acquisition and assimilation costs were approximately $1.5 million in 1994
compared with approximately $.5 million in 1993.  The cost of the early
retirement program was approximately $1.3 million in 1994.  The acquisition
and assimilation costs as well as the early retirement program are one-time
costs associated with the GGC acquisition.  Income taxes decreased to $8.1
million for 1994 from $10.1 million for 1993.  The primary reasons for the
decrease were lower pre-tax profits and a lower effective tax rate.   The
effective tax rate decreased to 35.6% in 1994 from 36.5% in 1993.  This was
primarily due to the impact of permanent differences on the lower pre-tax
profits in 1994.  Operating income decreased in 1994 by approximately 13%
to $26.5 million from $30.3 million in 1993.  The decrease in operating
income resulted primarily from increased operating expenses as discussed
above.

     Net income decreased in 1994 by approximately 16% to $14.7 million
from $17.5 million in the prior year.  This decrease in net income resulted
primarily from a decrease in operating income, which was partially offset
by a $1.0 million decrease in interest expense.  Net income per share
decreased to $.97 for 1994 from $1.22 for 1993, reflecting the effects of
an increase in average shares outstanding of approximately 6%.  One-time
acquisition costs, assimilation expenses and an early retirement program in
Greeley Gas Company, as well as the effect of adopting SFAS No. 106,
reduced earnings per share by approximately $.22 in 1994. 


YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1993 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1992

     Operating revenues increased to $459.6 million in 1993 from $403.4
million in 1992 due to colder weather, increased sales volumes and revenues
for every customer type, rate increases received in Texas and Louisiana,
and an increased number of customers in fiscal 1993.  Total sales volumes
increased 9.7 Bcf to 109.4 Bcf in 1993, as compared with 1992.  Average gas
sales  revenues per Mcf increased $.16 to $4.02 in fiscal 1993 from 1992,
while the average cost of gas per Mcf sold increased $.13 to $2.71.  The
number of meters in service increased to 636,159 at September 30, 1993
compared with 630,365 at September 30, 1992.  Weather was 10% colder in
1993 than 1992, and was 2% colder than normal.  Because of this colder
weather, sales volumes to weather sensitive residential, commercial and
public authority customers increased 5.8 Bcf, or 8%, to 78.0 Bcf in 1993,
as compared with 1992.  Sales volumes to industrial and agricultural
customers increased 3.9 Bcf, or 14%, because of increased irrigation fuel
demand in the Company's West Texas service area.  Revenues from gas






transported for others increased $1.3 million to approximately $15.0
million in 1993.  Average transportation fees decreased from $.42 per Mcf
to $.38 per Mcf, while transportation volumes increased 7.6 Bcf to 39.8 Bcf
in 1993 as compared with 1992.  Average transportation fees decreased in
1993 because of increased competition for large volume customers in
Kentucky. 

     Gross profit increased by approximately 12% to $163.1 million in 1993
from $146.3 million in 1992.  The primary factors contributing to the
higher gross profit were increased rates and colder weather, as discussed
above.  Operating expenses, excluding income taxes, increased to $122.8
million in 1993 from $117.9 million in 1992 due to increased operating
activity.  Operation expense increased $3.5 million due to increased
distribution expenses, outside services, wages and benefits expense. 
Income taxes increased to $10.1 million for 1993 from $4.8 million for
1992.  The primary reasons for the increase were higher pre-tax profits and
a higher effective tax rate.   The effective tax rate increased to 36.5% in
1993 from 30.2% in 1992 because of reduced significance of permanent
differences due to higher pre-tax profits and a one percent increase in the
statutory rate to 35%, effective January 1, 1993.  Operating income
increased in 1993 by approximately 28% to $30.3 million.  The increase in
operating income resulted primarily from increased gross profit.

     Net income increased in 1993 by approximately 60% to $17.5 million
from $11.0 million in 1992.  This increase in net income resulted primarily
from the increase in operating income.  Also, interest expense decreased
$.5 million in 1993, as compared with 1992, due to lower weighted average
interest rates.  Net income per share increased approximately 53% to $1.22
for 1993 compared with 1992, including the effects of an increase in
average shares outstanding of approximately 4%. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY (See "Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows")

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

     Cash flows from operating activities totaled $41.2 million for 1994
compared with $37.1 million for 1993 and $31.4 million for 1992.  The
decrease in net income in 1994 as compared with 1993 was more than offset
by the net changes in assets and liabilities.  Gas stored underground
decreased in 1994 because of substantially lower gas prices during the
summer of 1994 when the storage reservoir was being refilled.  The $10.9
million increase in deferred charges and other assets in 1993 related to
the $8.4 million increase in deferred credits and other liabilities and
recognized funding for the Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan.  See
"Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows" for other changes in assets and
liabilities.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

     Net cash used in investing activities totaled $48.4 million in 1994
compared with $42.2 million in 1993 and $39.5 million in 1992.  Capital
expenditures in fiscal 1994 amounted to $50.4 million compared with $43.1
million in 1993 and $42.2 million in 1992.  Currently budgeted capital
expenditures for 1995 total $56.1 million and include major expenditures






for mains, services, meters, vehicles and computer software.  Such
expenditures will be financed from internally generated funds and financing
activities, as discussed below.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

     Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $7.7 million for
1994 compared with $3.7 million for 1993 and $8.3 million in 1992. 
Financing activities during these periods included issuance of common
stock, dividend payments, borrowings from banks, and issuance and
repayments of long-term debt.

     Cash dividends and distributions paid. The Company paid $12.7 million
in cash dividends and distributions during 1994.  The $2.6 million increase
over 1993 primarily reflects an increase in the Company's quarterly
dividend rate and an increase in the number of shares of common stock
outstanding in 1994.  The Company has increased its historical dividend
rate in each of the last six years.  

     Short-term financing activities.  At September 30, 1994, the Company
had committed lines of credit totaling $72.0 million, all of which was
unused, in order to provide for short-term cash requirements.  These credit
facilities are negotiated at least annually.  At September 30, 1994, the
Company also had uncommitted short-term credit lines of $130.0 million, of
which $71.9 million was unused.  At September 30, 1994, $40.0 million of
notes payable to banks were classified noncurrent and long-term financing
was completed subsequent to September 30, 1994. During 1994, notes payable
increased $22.4 million compared with increases of $2.6 million during 1993
and $18.6 million in 1992.  The increases in 1994 and 1992 were primarily
due to funding of capital expenditures and repayment of long-term debt. 
The increase in 1993 was less than the increases in 1994 and 1992, partly
because of funds provided in 1993 from stock issued under the Direct Stock
Purchase Plan.  

     Long-term financing activities.  Payments of long-term debt increased
$5.4 million to $9.9 million for the year ended September 30, 1994 compared
with the year ended September 30, 1993.  Payments of long-term debt
consisted of a $3.0 million installment on the Company's 9.75% Senior Notes
due in 1996, a $2.0 million installment on the 11.2% Senior Notes, the
balance of $3.25 million on the 13.75% Series I First Mortgage Bonds and
the balance of $1.6 million on the 13% Series G First Mortgage Bonds.  At
September 30, 1994, the Company was negotiating the private placement of
$40.0 million of Senior Notes with two insurance companies.  Scheduled
payments of long-term debt in fiscal 1993 consisted of a $3.5 million
installment on the Company's 9.75% Senior Notes and a $1.0 million payment
on the 13.75% Series I First Mortgage Bonds.  No long-term debt was issued
in 1993.  The Company entered into an agreement with an insurance company
in August 1992, for a private placement of $10.0 million of unsecured
Senior Notes due in annual installments of $1.0 million from 1997 through
2006, with interest to be paid semiannually at 7.95%.  The net proceeds
from the sale of the Senior Notes were used primarily to refinance an 8.4%
note in the amount of $9.8 million.  The Company also made scheduled
installments of $4.5 million on its 9.75% Senior Notes, $1.0 million on the
13.75% Series I First Mortgage Bonds and a $.3 million installment on GGC's
13% Series G First Mortgage Bonds in fiscal 1992.  The loan agreements






pursuant to which all the Company's Senior Notes have been issued contain
covenants by the Company with respect to the maintenance of certain debt-
to-equity ratios and cash flows, and restrictions on the payment of
dividends.  Also see Note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements.

     Issuance of common stock.  The Company issued 428,264, 897,089 and
306,880 shares of common stock in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively, for
its Direct Stock Purchase Plan ("DSPP"), Employee Stock Ownership Plan and
Incentive Stock Option Plan.   The DSPP was implemented in August 1992. 
The DSPP has been amended to remove the direct stock purchase feature of
the plan and has been renamed the Atmos Energy Corporation Dividend
Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ("DRSPP").  In 1994, 1993 and 1992,
173,801, 760,089 and 132,249 shares, respectively, were issued under the
plan, generating proceeds of $3.0 million, $13.4 million and $1.9 million,
respectively.  At September 30, 1994, 712,596 shares were available for
future issuance under the plan.

     The Company believes that internally generated funds, its short-term
credit facilities and access to the debt and equity capital markets will
provide necessary working capital and liquidity for capital expenditures
and other cash needs for 1995.

Seasonality

     The Company's natural gas distribution business is seasonal due to
weather conditions in the Company's service areas.  Gas sales are affected
by winter heating season requirements, and sales to agricultural customers
(who use natural gas as fuel in the operation of irrigation pumps) during
the period from April through September may be affected by rainfall
amounts.  These factors generally result in higher operating revenues and
net income during the period from October through March of each year and
lower operating revenues and either net losses or lower net income during
the period from April through September of each year.

     The following table sets forth, on an unaudited basis, the Company's
quarterly operating revenues, quarterly operating revenues as a percentage
of annual operating revenues, quarterly net income (loss) and quarterly net
income (loss) as a percentage of annual net income for its past two fiscal
years.

















 



                 Inflation

               The Company believes that inflation has caused and will
          continue to cause increases in certain operating expenses and has
          required assets and will continue to require assets to be re-
          placed at higher costs.  The Company continually reviews the
          adequacy of its gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of
          providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting
          those gas rates. 

          Environmental Matters

              From time to time, the Company receives inquiries regarding
          various environmental matters.  The Company believes that its
          properties and operations substantially comply with and are oper-
          ated in substantial conformity with all applicable environmental
          statutes and regulations.  There are no administrative or judi-
          cial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes
          pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies
          which, if adversely determined, would have a material adverse
          effect on the Company.

          REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,
          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS 


          Board of Directors
          Atmos Energy Corporation

               We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
          of Atmos Energy Corporation at September 30, 1994 and 1993, and
          the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders'
          equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
          ended September 30, 1994.  Our audits also included the financial
          statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 14(a).  These
          financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the
          Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
          opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our
          audits.

                  We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
          accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that we
          plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
          whether the financial statements are free of material
          misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
          evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
          statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
          principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
          well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
          We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
          opinion.

               In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
          present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
          financial position of Atmos Energy Corporation at September 30,
          1994 and 1993, and its consolidated results of operations and its
          cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
          September 30, 1994 in conformity with generally accepted
          accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related
          financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the
          basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in
          all material respects the information set forth therein.

          ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION
          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

          1.   Summary of significant accounting policies

               Description of business - Atmos Energy Corporation and its
          subsidiaries ("Atmos" or the "Company") are in the business of
          distributing natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial
          and agricultural customers within service areas located in Texas,
          Louisiana, Kentucky, Colorado, Kansas and a small portion of
          Missouri.  Such business is subject to federal and state
          regulation and/or regulation by local authorities in each of the
          six states in which the Company operates.  The Company has no
          other material business segments.

               Principles of consolidation - The accompanying consolidated
          financial statements include the accounts of Atmos Energy Corpora-
          tion and its subsidiaries.  Each subsidiary is wholly-owned and
          all material intercompany items have been eliminated.

               Revenue recognition -  Sales of natural gas are billed on a
          monthly cycle basis; however, the billing cycle periods for
          certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with ac-
          counting periods used for financial reporting purposes.  The
          Company follows the revenue accrual method of accounting for
          natural gas revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered
          to customers but not yet billed under the cycle billing method are
          estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to ex-
          pense. Estimated losses due to credit risk are reserved at the
          time revenue is recognized.  

               Property, plant and equipment - Property, plant and equipment
          is stated at original cost net of contributions in aid of constru-
          ction.  The cost of additions includes an allowance for funds used
          during construction and applicable overhead charges.  Major
          renewals and betterments are capitalized, while the costs of
          maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. 
          Property, plant and equipment is depreciated at various rates on a
          straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 
          In the first quarter of fiscal 1993, the Company changed the
          estimated average useful lives used to compute depreciation for
          certain utility plant assets.  These changes resulted from revised
          estimates of the projected economic life of the affected assets
          based on recent orders received from regulatory bodies having
          jurisdiction over the Company and independently performed
          depreciation service life studies.  The effect of this change on
          net income for the year ended September 30, 1993 was an increase
          of $1,104,000.  The composite rates were 3.5% and 3.7% for the
          years ended September 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  At the
          time property, plant and equipment is retired, the cost, plus
          removal expenses and less salvage, is charged to accumulated
          depreciation.









               Inventories - Inventories consist of materials and supplies
          and merchandise held for resale.  Inventories are stated at the
          lower of average cost or market.

               Gas stored underground - Net additions of inventory gas to
          underground storage and withdrawals of inventory gas from storage
          are priced using the average cost method.  Non-current gas in
          storage is classified as property, plant and equipment and is
          priced at cost.  

               Income taxes - The Company provides deferred income taxes for
          significant temporary differences in the recognition of revenues
          and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes.  

               Cash and cash equivalents - The Company considers all highly
          liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months
          or less to be cash equivalents.

               Deferred charges and other assets - Deferred charges and
          other assets at September 30, 1994 and 1993 include assets of the
          Company's qualified defined benefit retirement plans in excess of
          the plans' obligations in the amounts of $12,275,000 and
          $13,289,000, respectively, and Company assets related to the
          nonqualified retirement plans at September 30, 1994 and 1993 of
          $15,735,000 and $12,758,000, respectively.  At September 30, 1994,
          a payable of $1,300,000 was recorded for expenses related to an
          early retirement program under Greeley Gas Company's qualified
          defined benefit retirement plan.

               Deferred credits and other liabilities - Deferred credits and
          other liabilities include customer advances for construction of
          $8,428,000 and $7,769,000 at September 30, 1994 and 1993, respect-
          ively; obligations under capital leases of $6,294,000 and
          $6,389,000 at September 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively; and
          obligations under the Company's nonqualified retirement plans of
          $11,151,000 and $8,317,000 at September 30, 1994 and 1993,
          respectively.

               Earnings per share - The calculation of primary earnings per
          share is based on reported net income divided by weighted average
          common shares outstanding.  The Company does not have other class-
          es of stock or dilutive common stock equivalents.  See Note 2 for

               On December 22, 1993, Atmos acquired by means of a merger all
          of the assets and liabilities of Greeley Gas Company ("GGC") in
          accordance with the terms and provisions of an Agreement and Plan
          of Reorganization dated July 2, 1993.  GGC is a natural gas
          utility engaged in the distribution and sale of natural gas to
          residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and other
          customers throughout Colorado, Kansas, and a small portion of
          Missouri.  All of the shares of GGC's common stock were exchanged
          for a total of 3,493,995 shares of Atmos common stock as adjusted






          for a 3-for-2 stock split (2,329,330 shares on a pre-split basis). 
          See Note 5 for information regarding the stock split in May 1994. 
          This merger transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interes-
          ts; therefore, all historical financial statements and notes
          thereto have been restated.  Subsequent to the merger, the
          business of GGC has been operated through the Company's Greeley
          Gas Company division (the "Greeley Gas Division").

               GGC prepared its financial statements on a December 31 fiscal
          year end.  GGC's fiscal year has been changed to September 30 to
          conform to the Company's year end.  The restated September 30,
          1993 balance sheet, as presented, is the combined balance sheets
          of Atmos and GGC as of September 30, 1993.  The restated
          consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the year
          ended September 30, 1992 include Atmos operations for the year
          then ended and GGC operations for the year ended December 31,
          1992.  The restated consolidated statement of income for the year
          ended September 30, 1993 includes Atmos and GGC operations for the
          twelve months then ended.  As a result, GGC's operations for the
          three months ended December 31, 1992 (operating revenue of
          $18,322,842 and net income of $950,185) are included in both the
          1993 and 1992 restated statements of income, the GGC net income
          for this period has been deducted in calculating the shareholders'
          equity balances at September 30, 1993 and cash flows for the year
          then ended.

               In 1987, GGC elected classification as an S Corporation
          (small business corporation) under the provisions of the Internal
          Revenue Code.  Normally, income taxes are not reported in the
          financial statements of S Corporations as the liability for
          payment of federal and state income taxes is the direct responsib-
          ility of the shareholders.  However, during 1991, as part of the
          settlement of rate cases filed in the states of Colorado and
          Kansas, GGC was ordered to begin providing for current and de-
          ferred income taxes.  Accordingly, the Company's restated 1991
          financial statements include a one-time charge to income of
          $1,081,202 to reinstate deferred income taxes for GGC.  Supple-
          mental net income and earnings per share of the Company are
          presented below to eliminate the one-time charge and to reflect
          income tax expense in periods prior to 1994 as if GGC had not made
          the S Corporation election in 1987.

          dividends declared by Atmos reflect the per share dividends
          declared by Atmos Energy Corporation for each of the three years
          ended September 30, 1994.  The restated cash dividends and
          distributions per share reflect the total amounts paid by Atmos
          and GGC to their shareholders in each of those three years,

               Subsequent to September 30, 1994, the Company obtained
          commitments to enter into new note purchase agreements with two
          insurance companies to issue at par $20,000,000 of unsecured
          Senior Notes at 8.07% payable in annual installments of $4,000,000 
          beginning October 31, 2002 through October 31, 2006 with  semi-
          annual interest payments and $20,000,000 of unsecured Senior Notes
          at 8.26% payable in annual installments of $1,818,182  beginning
          October 31, 2004 through October 31, 2014 with semiannual interest
          payments.  At September 30, 1994, $40,000,000 of notes payable to
          banks were classified as long-term.






               The Company entered into a note purchase agreement with an
          insurance company in August 1992, for a private placement of
          $10,000,000 of unsecured Senior Notes at 7.95%.  The net proceeds
          from the sale of the Senior Notes were used primarily to refinance
          an 8.4% note in the amount of $9.8 million.

              The Company may prepay any of the Senior Notes in whole at any
          time, subject to a prepayment premium.  The note agreements
          provide for certain cash flow requirements and restrictions on
          additional indebtedness, sale of assets and payment of dividends. 
          Under the most restrictive of such covenants, cumulative cash
          dividends paid after September 30, 1988 may not exceed the sum of
          75% of accumulated net income for periods after September 30, 1988
          plus $12,000,000 plus the proceeds from the sale of common stock
          after September 30, 1988.  At September 30, 1994, approximately
          $44,492,000 of shareholders' equity was not so restricted.

               As of September 30, 1994, all of the Company's utility plant
          assets in Colorado, Kansas and Missouri with a book value of
          approximately $59,173,000 are subject to a lien under the 9.4%
          Series J First Mortgage Bonds assumed by the Company in the
          acquisition of GGC.

          Notes payable to banks

               The Company has committed short-term, unsecured bank credit
          facilities totaling $72,000,000, all of which was unused at
          September 30, 1994.  One facility of $60,000,000 requires a
          commitment fee of 1/8 of 1% on the unused portion.  A second
          facility for $12,000,000 requires a commitment fee of 3/16 of 1%
          on the unused portion.  The committed lines are renewed or
          renegotiated at least annually. 

               The Company also had aggregate uncommitted credit lines of
          $130,000,000, of which $71,900,000 was unused as of September 30,
          1994.  The uncommitted lines have varying terms and the Company
          pays no fee for the availability of the lines.  Borrowings under
          these lines are made on a when and as-available basis at the
          discretion of the banks.

          $28,593 for  1993 and 1992, respectively.

          4. Income taxes

               The components of income tax expense for 1994, 1993 and 1992
          are as follows:     
                                              1994        1993      1992

               Included in the provision for income taxes are state income
          taxes of $328,000, $890,000, and $403,000 for 1994, 1993, and
          1992, respectively.

               Effective October 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
          Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
          Taxes" ("SFAS No. 109") and, as permitted under the new rules,
          prior years' financial statements have not been restated. 
          Adoption of the new standard in 1994 had no significant effect on
          net income.

               This standard changes the Company's method of accounting for
          income taxes from the deferred method (APB 11) to the liability






          method.  Previously the Company deferred the past tax effects of
          timing differences between financial reporting and taxable income. 
          Under the liability method of SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets
          and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax
          effects of differences between the financial statement carrying
          amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
          tax bases.  

               Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of differences
          between the basis of assets and liabilities for book and tax
          purposes.  The tax effect of temporary differences that give rise
          to significant components of the deferred tax liabilities and
          deferred tax assets at September 30, 1994 and October 1, 1993 are

               During 1993 and 1992, deferred income taxes were provided for
          significant timing differences in recognition of revenues and
          expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes.  The effects of
          these timing differences at September 30, 1993 and 1992 were as

          5. Stock split

               On February 9, 1994, the Board of Directors of Atmos approved
          a 3-for-2 split of its common stock implemented in the form of a
          stock dividend, which resulted in shareholders receiving one new
          share for every two shares held.  Fractional shares were not
          issued but were paid in cash or credited to the accounts of
          participants of the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
          ("DRSPP") and ESOP.  The record date for the split was May 4, 1994
          and the payment date for mailing the new shares and cash for
          fractional shares to shareholders was May 16, 1994.  All share and







          per share amounts in the financial statements and notes thereto
          have been restated to reflect this split, unless otherwise noted.

          6. Common stock and stock options

               The Company issued 428,264 shares of its common stock in
          fiscal 1994 in connection with its Direct Stock Purchase Plan,
          Restricted Stock Grant Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan.  It
          also issued common stock in connection with the GGC merger (Note
          2) and the stock split (Note 5).

               The Company has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan as discussed
          in Note 7.  The Company has registered 600,000 shares for issuance
          under the plan, of which 134,776 shares were available for future
          issuance on September 30, 1994.

               In August 1992 the Company announced a Direct Stock Purchase
          Plan ("DSPP") which was the successor to and replacement for the
          Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("DRP").  Members of the DRP were
          automatically enrolled in the DSPP.  In November 1993, the Company
          amended the DSPP to remove the direct stock purchase feature of
          the plan and to rename the plan the Atmos Energy Corporation
          Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ("DRSPP").  The
          DRSPP is now available to shareholders of record only. 
          Participants in the DRSPP may have all or part of their dividends
          reinvested at a 3% discount from market prices.  DRSPP
          participants may purchase additional shares of Company common
          stock as often as weekly with optional cash payments of at least
          $25, up to an annual maximum of $60,000.  At September 30, 1994,
          712,596 shares were available for future issuance under the plan. 

               On April 27, 1988, the Company adopted a Shareholders' Rights
          Plan (the "Rights Plan") and declared a dividend of one right (a
          "Right") for each outstanding pre-split share of common stock of
          the Company, payable to shareholders of record as of May 10, 1988. 
          Each Right will entitle the holder thereof, until the earlier of
          May 10, 1998 or the date of redemption of the Rights, to buy one
          share of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $30 
          per share, subject to adjustment by the Board of Directors upon
          the occurrence of certain events.  The Rights will be represented
          by the common stock certificates and are not exercisable or
          transferable apart from the common stock until a "Distribution
          Date" (which is defined in the Rights Agreement between the
          Company and the Rights Agent as the date upon which the Rights
          become separate from the common stock).

               At no time will the Rights have any voting rights.  The
          exercise price payable and the number of shares of common stock or
          other securities or property issuable upon exercise of the Rights
          are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution. 
          Until the Distribution Date, the Company will issue one Right with
          each share of common stock that becomes outstanding so that all
          shares of common stock will have attached Rights.  After a
          Distribution Date, the Company may issue Rights when it issues







          common stock if the Board deems such issuance to be necessary or
          appropriate.

               The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects and may cause
          substantial dilution to a person or entity that attempts to
          acquire the Company on terms not approved by the Board of
          Directors except pursuant to an offer conditioned upon a
          substantial number of Rights being acquired.  The Rights should
          not interfere with any merger or other business combination
          approved by the Board of Directors because, prior to the time the
          Rights become exercisable or transferable, the Rights may be
          redeemed by the Company at $.05 per Right.

               The Company has had an Incentive Stock Option Plan for key
          employees covering an aggregate of 100,000 shares of common stock. 
          The plan provided for options to be granted at prices not less
          than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and
          to be exercisable over ten years from such date in cumulative
          annual installments of 25% of the aggregate shares granted,
          commencing one year after the date of grant.  At September 30,
          1993, no options were outstanding under the plan.  The Company
          allowed the plan to expire in October 1993 without granting
          additional options.

               The following table summarizes the status of the expired
          Incentive Stock Option Plan as of September 30, 1993 and 1992:

               The Company's Restricted Stock Grant Plan for management and
          key employees of the Company, which became effective October 1,
          1987, provides for awards of common stock that are subject to
          certain restrictions.  The plan is administered by the Board of
          Directors.  The members of the Board who are not employees of the
          Company make the final determinations regarding participation in
          the plan, awards under the plan, and restrictions on the re-
          stricted stock awarded.  The restricted stock may consist of






          previously issued shares purchased in the open market or shares
          issued directly from the Company.  The total number of shares of
          restricted stock that may be awarded under the plan was increased
          to 600,000 shares (900,000 post-split shares) after receiving
          shareholder approval in 1993.  During 1994, 1993 and 1992,
          109,500, 25,500 and 51,750 shares, respectively, were awarded
          under the plan.  Prior to 1992, 328,950 shares were awarded under
          the plan.  Related compensation expense of $1,164,000, $735,000
          and $673,000 was recognized in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. 
          At September 30, 1994, 384,300 shares were available for award.

          7.   Employee retirement and stock ownership plans

               At September 30, 1994, the Company had three defined benefit
          pension plans.  One covers the Western Kentucky Division employ-
          ees, one covers the Greeley Gas Division employees, and the third
          covers all other Atmos employees.  The plans provide essentially
          the same benefits to all employees.  Benefits are based on years
          of service and the employee's compensation during the highest paid
          five consecutive calendar years within the last 10 years of
          employment.  The Company's funding policy is to contribute
          annually an amount in accordance with the requirements of the Em-
          ployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  Contributions are
          intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to
          date but also for those expected to be earned in the future.  

               The following table sets forth the combined funded status of
          the Company's defined benefit retirement plans at June 30, 1994
          and 1993 and amounts recognized in the Company's balance sheets at

               The weighted-average discount rates used in determining the
          actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation were
          8.375% and 7.75% at June 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The
          rate of increase in future compensation levels reflected in such
          determination was 4.5% and 5.0% for the years ended September 30,
          1994 and 1993, respectively.  The expected long-term rate of
          return on assets was 9.5%, 8.5% and 9.0% for the years ended
          September 30, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The plan assets
          consist primarily of investments in common stocks, interest
          bearing securities and interests in commingled pension trust
          funds.  Prepaid pension cost is included in deferred charges and
          other assets.

               Accumulated plan benefits were computed using the Projected
          Unit Credit funding method.  The discount rate and rate of in-
          crease in future compensation levels used in determining the
          actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations were
          8.375% and 4.5%, respectively, in 1994 and 7.75% and 6.25%,
          respectively, in 1993.  The expected long-term rate of return on
          plan assets was 9.5% and 9.0% in 1994 and 1993, respectively. 
          Plan assets consist primarily of corporate bonds, equity securit-
          ies, mutual funds, partnership interests, and other miscellaneous
          investments.  The actual return on plan assets in 1994 resulted in
          a loss of $.4 million due to writedowns of certain plan assets to
          reflect current market value.







               Effective October 1, 1987, the Company adopted a nonqualified
          Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan ("Supplemental Plan") which
          provides additional pension benefits to the executive officers and
          certain other employees of the Company.  Expense recognized in
          connection with the Supplemental Plan during fiscal 1994, 1993 and
          1992 was $2,062,000, $1,492,000 and $872,000, respectively.

               The Company sponsors an Employee Stock Ownership Plan
          ("ESOP").  Full time employees who have completed one year of
          service, as defined in the plan, are eligible to participate. 
          Each participant enters into a salary reduction agreement with the
          Company pursuant to which the participant's salary is reduced by
          an amount not less than 2% nor more than 10%.  Taxes on the amount
          by which the participant's salary is reduced are deferred pursuant
          to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The amount of the
          salary reduction is contributed by the Company to the ESOP for the
          account of the participant.  The Company may make a matching
          contribution for the account of the participant in an amount
          determined each year by the Board of Directors, which amount must
          be at least equal to 25% of all or a portion of the participant's
          salary reduction.  For the 1994 plan year, the Board of Directors
          elected to match 100% of each participant's salary reduction
          contribution up to 4% of the participant's salary.  These matching
          percentages have also been approved for the 1995 plan year. 
          Matching contributions to the ESOP amounted to $1,780,000,
          $1,413,000, and $1,324,000 for 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. 
          The Directors may also approve discretionary contributions,
          subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and
          applicable regulations of the Internal Revenue Service.  The
          Company recorded a charge of $1,000,000 for a discretionary
          contribution in the year ended September 30, 1993.  Company
          contributions to the plan are expensed as incurred.    

               Effective January 1, 1988, the Greeley Gas Division adopted a
          401(k) plan that covers substantially all the Greeley Gas Division
          employees.  Employee contributions are limited to 6% of base
          compensation.  The Company matches 50% of employee contributions. 
          Total employer contributions to the 401(k) plan were $141,000,
          $230,000, and $288,000 for the periods ended September 30, 1994,
          1993, and 1992, respectively.  Contributions to the plan were
          discontinued on March 31, 1994 and participants were enrolled in
          the Atmos ESOP on April 1, 1994.  

          8.   Other postretirement benefits

               In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company
          provides certain other postretirement benefits for retired
          employees, the major benefit being health care.  To be eligible
          for these benefits, an employee must retire under the terms of the
          Company's retirement plans.  Prior to 1994, the cost of other
          postretirement benefits was recognized by expensing claims and
          annual insurance premiums as incurred.  In fiscal 1993 and 1992,
          these costs totaled $1,453,000 and $1,626,000, respectively.








               Effective October 1, 1993, the Company adopted Financial
          Accounting Standards No. 106 ("SFAS No. 106"), "Employers'
          Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions".  SFAS
          No. 106 focuses principally on postretirement health care benefits
          and significantly changed the practice of accounting for post-
          retirement benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis by requiring accrual
          of such benefit costs at Atmos on an actuarial basis from the date
          each employee reaches age 45 until the date of full eligibility
          for such benefits.  The Company is amortizing on a straight line
          basis the initial transition obligation of $33,354,000 over 20
          years.  The effect of adopting the new rules increased net
          periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year ended September
          30, 1994 by $3,789,000 and decreased net income for the period by
          $2,440,000.  Approximately $746,000 of this increased cost was
          recovered through rates during 1994.

               Atmos sponsors two defined benefit postretirement plans other
          than pensions.  One plan provides medical, dental, vision and life
          insurance benefits to retired employees of Greeley Gas Company. 
          The other offers medical benefits to all other retired Atmos
          employees.  Substantially all of the Company's employees may
          become eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement age
          while working for the Company and attain 10 consecutive years of
          service.  Participant contributions are required under these
          plans.  Prior to June 1994, the plans were not funded.  In June
          1994, the Company made its first quarterly payment to the external
          trust set up to fund SFAS No. 106 costs in excess of the pay-as-
          you-go cost in Kansas in accordance with an order of the Kansas
          Corporation Commission.  The amount of funding will ultimately
          depend upon the ratemaking treatment allowed in the Company's
          various rate jurisdictions.  

               The components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost
          for the year ended September 30, 1994 are as follows (in thou-
          sands):

          Service cost                             $1,817

               In the latest actuarial calculation of the accrued postre-
          tirement benefits liability, the assumed health care cost trend
          rate used to estimate the cost of postretirement benefits was
          10.5% for the 1993-1994 year, 9.5% for the 1994-1995 year and is
          assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% for 1999-2000 and remain at
          that level thereafter.  Similarly, the dental trend rate is 8.0%
          for the 1993-1994 year and gradually decreases to 7.0% for 1995-
          1996 at which time dental benefits will be discontinued.  The
          trend for vision benefits is assumed to remain level for all years
          at 4.5%.  The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed health care
          cost trend rate for each future year is $410,000 on the annual
          aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net
          periodic postretirement benefit costs and $2,279,000 on the
          accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of September 30,
          1994.  The assumed discount rate, the rate at which liabilities
          could be settled, was 8.25% and 7.0% as of September 30, 1994 and
          1993, respectively.

               The Company is currently recovering other postretirement
          benefit ("OPEB") costs through its regulated rates on a pay-as-
          you-go basis in a majority of its service areas in Texas, Kentucky
          and Louisiana.  It is allowed to recover OPEB costs in its
          remaining service areas under SFAS No. 106 accrual accounting. 
          The rate recovery of SFAS No. 106 cost by jurisdiction is discuss-
          ed below.  Management believes that accrual accounting in accor-
          dance with SFAS No. 106 is appropriate and will seek rate recovery
          of accrual-based expenses in all of its ratemaking jurisdictions.  

               In May 1993, the Louisiana Commission issued an order for all
          utilities under its jurisdiction to continue to use the pay-as-
          you-go accounting method for rate treatment of SFAS No. 106 costs. 






          Utilities may apply to the Louisiana Commission for authority to
          recognize a regulatory asset to be amortized on a pay-as-you-go
          basis to bridge the gap between ratemaking and accounting.  The
          Louisiana Commission retains the flexibility to examine individual
          companies' accounting for SFAS No. 106 costs to determine if
          special exceptions to this order are warranted.  Recovery of SFAS
          No. 106 costs were not allowed in the Company's Rate Stabilization
          Clause increase implemented March 1, 1994.

               In June 1992, the Kentucky Public Service Commission
          ("Kentucky Commission") declined a request by a group of utilities
          to grant a blanket commitment for the future recovery of SFAS No.
          106 costs in excess of pay-as-you-go costs for all utilities.  The
          Kentucky Commission's order stated that each utility could file an
          individual application to seek recovery of such costs.  At a
          rehearing held in December 1992, the Kentucky Commission affirmed
          its initial order.

               In May 1993, the Company filed rate requests which included
          SFAS No. 106 costs in Fritch and Sanford, Texas and for the
          surrounding environs.  The rates for the environs are subject to
          the jurisdiction of the Railroad Commission of Texas ("Railroad
          Commission").  In its order of August 30, 1993, the Railroad
          Commission approved recovery of SFAS No. 106 costs and internal
          funding.

               In September 1994 the Company filed for a rate increase with
          its West Texas cities.  The rate case, which included SFAS No. 106
          costs, was settled with those cities subsequent to September 30,
          1994. 

               In September 1993, GGC filed a rate request for its Colorado
          service area which included SFAS No. 106 costs.  In May 1994, the
          Company began implementing new rates in its Colorado service area. 
          The new rates increased annual revenues by $3,200,000 and included
          recovery of accrual-based SFAS No. 106 costs.  By order issued in
          October 1994, the Colorado Public Utility Commission approved
          recovery of SFAS No. 106 costs with the condition of external
          funding of the difference between SFAS No. 106 expense and pay-as-
          you-go expense.

               By order issued in November 1993, the Kansas Corporation
          Commission approved recovery of SFAS No. 106 expenses beginning in
          December 1993 with the condition that the difference between
          amounts computed as SFAS No. 106 expense and pay-as-you-go expense
          shall be remitted quarterly to an external trust fund. 

               The Company will seek rate recovery of accrual based SFAS No.
          106 expenses in its ratemaking jurisdictions that have not yet
          approved the recovery of these expenses.  The portion of this
          additional expense in excess of the pay-as-you-go amount in these
          ratemaking jurisdictions that will immediately or ultimately be
          allowed in rates cannot presently be determined.  The ultimate
          impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 106 on the Company's financial
          position and results of operations will not be known with certain-






          ty until the regulatory treatment that will be allowed in each of
          the Company's ratemaking jurisdictions is determined.

          9.   Postemployment benefits

               The Company also provides postemployment benefits, primarily
          workers' compensation, to former or inactive employees after
          employment but before retirement.  The Financial Accounting
          Standards Board has issued Statement of Financial Accounting
          Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
          Benefits" ("SFAS No. 112"), which applies to such benefits and
          will be effective for the Company's 1995 fiscal year.  Under SFAS
          No. 112, employers are required to recognize the obligation to
          provide postemployment benefits if certain conditions are met. 
          Postemployment benefit costs are currently recorded and recovered
          in rates on the pay-as-you-go basis.  The rate treatment of SFAS
          No. 112 accrual based costs has not been determined at this time. 
          The reduction in future earnings, if any, that would result from
          this accrual would be offset to the extent that it is approved to
          be recovered in rates. Based on a preliminary actuarial study, the
          Company currently estimates that the cumulative effect of impleme-
          ntation of SFAS No. 112 and the increase in future annual costs
          will not have a material adverse effect on earnings.

          11.  Contingencies

               On March 15, 1991, suit was filed in the 15th Judicial
          District Court of Lafayette Parish, Louisiana, by the "Lafayette
          Daily Advertiser" and others against the Trans La Division, Trans
          Louisiana Industrial Gas Company, Inc. ("TLIG"), a wholly owned
          subsidiary of the Company, and Louisiana Intrastate Gas Corporati-
          on and certain of its affiliates ("LIG").  LIG is the Company's
          primary supplier of natural gas in Louisiana and is not otherwise
          affiliated with the Company.

               The plaintiffs purported to represent a class consisting of
          all residential and commercial gas customers in the Trans La
          Division's service area.  Among other things, the lawsuit alleged






          that the defendants violated antitrust laws of the state of
          Louisiana by manipulating the cost-of-gas component of the Trans
          La Division's gas rate to the purported customer class, thereby
          causing such purported class members to pay a higher rate.  The
          plaintiffs made no specific allegation of an amount of damages.

               The defendants brought an appeal to the Louisiana Supreme
          Court of rulings by the trial court and the Third Circuit Court of
          Appeal which denied defendants' exceptions to the jurisdiction of
          the trial court.  It was the position of the defendants that the
          plaintiffs' claims amount to complaints about the level of gas
          rates and should be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the
          Louisiana Commission.

               On January 19, 1993, the Louisiana Supreme Court issued a
          decision reversing in part the lower courts' rulings, dismissing
          all of plaintiffs' claims against the defendants which seek
          damages due to alleged overcharges and further ruling that all
          such claims are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Louisiana
          Commission.  Any claims which seek damages other than overcharges
          were remanded to the trial court but were stayed pending the
          completion of the Louisiana Commission proceeding referred to
          below.

               The Louisiana Commission has instituted a docketed proceeding
          for the purpose of investigating the costs included in the Trans
          La Division's purchased gas adjustment component of its rates. 
          Both the Trans La Division and LIG are parties to the proceeding. 
          Much of the discovery in this proceeding has been conducted and a
          procedural schedule has been established. The Company believes the
          allegations as they relate to the Company, whether brought in
          court or at the Louisiana Commission, are without merit, and that
          the chances of a material adverse outcome are remote.  The Company
          will continue to vigorously protect its interest in this matter.

               From time to time, claims are made and lawsuits are filed
          against the Company arising out of the ordinary business of the
          Company.  In the opinion of the Company's management, liabilities,
          if any, arising from these actions are either covered by
          insurance, adequately reserved for by the Company or would not
          have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
          Company.

          13.  Leases 

               The Company has entered into noncancelable leases involving
          office space and warehouse space.  The remaining lease terms range
          from one to 20 years and generally provide for the payment of
          taxes, insurance and maintenance by the lessee.  Net property,
          plant and equipment included amounts for capital leases of
          $5,664,000 and $6,029,000 at September 30, 1994 and 1993,
          respectively.
