ITEM 1.

Business.

Overview
    and Strategy

Atmos Energy Corporation, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is
    engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and
    transmission and storage businesses as well as other
    nonregulated natural gas businesses. Since our incorporation in
    Texas in 1983, we have grown primarily through a series of
    acquisitions, the most recent of which was the acquisition in
    October 2004 of the natural gas distribution and pipeline
    operations of TXU Gas Company. We are also incorporated in the
    state of Virginia.

Today, we distribute natural gas through regulated sales and
    transportation arrangements to over 3 million residential,
    commercial, public authority and industrial customers in
    12 states located primarily in the South, which makes us
    one of the country’s largest natural-gas-only distributors
    based on number of customers. We also operate one of the largest
    intrastate pipelines in Texas based on miles of pipe.

Through our nonregulated businesses, we primarily provide
    natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities,
    other local gas distribution companies and industrial customers
    primarily in the Midwest and Southeast and natural gas
    transportation along with storage services to certain of our
    natural gas distribution divisions and third parties.

Our overall strategy is to:

•

deliver superior shareholder value,

•

improve the quality and consistency of earnings growth, while
    operating our regulated and nonregulated businesses
    exceptionally well and

•

enhance and strengthen a culture built on our core values.

We have experienced more than 25 consecutive years of increasing
    dividends and earnings growth after giving effect to our
    acquisitions. Historically, we achieved this record of growth
    through acquisitions while efficiently managing our operating
    and maintenance expenses and leveraging our technology to
    achieve more efficient operations. In recent years, we have also
    achieved growth by implementing rate designs that reduce or
    eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our
    approved margins from customer usage patterns. In addition, we
    have developed various commercial opportunities within our
    regulated transmission and storage operations. Finally, we have
    strengthened our nonregulated businesses by increasing sales
    volumes and improving

per-unit

margins.

Our core values include focusing on our employees and customers
    while conducting our business with honesty and integrity. We
    continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing
    communications with our employees and enhanced employee training.

Operating
    Segments

We operate the Company through the following four segments:

•

The

natural gas distribution segment

, which includes our
    regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations.

•

The

regulated transmission and storage segment

, which
    includes the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our
    Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division.

•

The

natural gas marketing segment

, which includes a
    variety of nonregulated natural gas management services.



•

The

pipeline, storage and other segment

, which is
    comprised of our nonregulated natural gas gathering,
    transmission and storage services.

These operating segments are described in greater detail below.

Natural
    Gas Distribution Segment Overview

Our natural gas distribution segment consists of the following
    six regulated divisions, presented in order of total customers
    served, covering service areas in 12 states:

•

Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division,

•

Atmos Energy Kentucky/Mid-States Division,

•

Atmos Energy Louisiana Division,

•

Atmos Energy West Texas Division,

•

Atmos Energy Mississippi Division and

•

Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division

Our natural gas distribution business is a seasonal business.
    Gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater
    during the winter months than during the remainder of the year.
    The volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with
    the temperatures during these months.

Revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory
    authorities in the states in which we operate. These rates are
    intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting
    business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital.
    Our primary service areas are located in Colorado, Kansas,
    Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. We have
    more limited service areas in Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri
    and Virginia. In addition, we transport natural gas for others
    through our distribution system.

Rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost
    adjustment mechanisms for costs that (i) are subject to
    significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs,
    (ii) represent a large component of our cost of service and
    (iii) are generally outside our control.

Purchased gas cost mechanisms represent a common form of cost
    adjustment mechanism. Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms
    provide natural gas utility companies a method of recovering
    purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate
    case because they provide a

dollar-for-dollar

offset to increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas
    costs. Therefore, although substantially all of our natural gas
    distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas
    that we purchase, natural gas distribution gross profit (which
    is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost) is
    generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas.

Additionally, some jurisdictions have introduced
    performance-based ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives
    to natural gas utilities to minimize purchased gas costs through
    improved storage management and use of financial instruments to
    lock in gas costs. Under the performance-based ratemaking
    adjustment, purchased gas costs savings are shared between the
    utility and its customers.

Finally, regulatory authorities have approved weather
    normalization adjustments (WNA) for over 90 percent of
    residential and commercial meters in our service areas as a part
    of our rates. WNA minimizes the effect of weather that is above
    or below normal by allowing us to increase customers’ bills
    to offset lower gas usage when weather is warmer than normal and
    decrease customers’ bills to offset higher gas usage when
    weather is colder than normal.



As of September 30, 2009 we had WNA for our residential and
    commercial meters in the following service areas for the
    following periods:

Georgia

October — May

Kansas

October — May

Kentucky

November — April

Louisiana

December — March

Mississippi

November — April

Tennessee

November — April

Texas: Mid-Tex

November — April

Texas: West Texas

October — May

Virginia

January — December

Financial results for this segment are affected by the cost of
    natural gas and economic conditions in the areas that we serve.
    As discussed above, we are generally able to pass the cost of
    gas through to our customers under purchased gas adjustment
    clauses; therefore, the cost of gas typically does not have a
    direct impact on our gross profit. However, higher gas costs may
    cause customers to conserve or, in the case of industrial
    customers, to use alternative energy sources. Higher gas costs
    may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections,
    resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to
    increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in
    higher interest expense.

Our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers,
    including independent producers, marketers and pipeline
    companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted
    storage assets. Additionally, the natural gas supply for our
    Mid-Tex Division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements.

Supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply
    (peaking) quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a
    firm basis with various terms at market prices. Base load
    quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout
    the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to
    change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in
    requirements related to weather conditions.

Currently, all of our natural gas distribution divisions, except
    for our Mid-Tex Division, utilize 39 pipeline transportation
    companies, both interstate and intrastate, to transport our
    natural gas. The pipeline transportation agreements are firm and
    many of them have “pipeline no-notice” storage
    service, which provides for daily balancing between system
    requirements and nominated flowing supplies. These agreements
    have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while
    still maintaining our right of first refusal. The natural gas
    supply for our Mid-Tex Division is delivered by our Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division.

Except for local production purchases, we select our natural gas
    suppliers through a competitive bidding process by requesting
    proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can
    provide reliable service. We select these suppliers based on
    their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm
    pipeline receipt points at the lowest cost. Major suppliers
    during fiscal 2009 were Anadarko Energy Services, Chesapeake
    Energy Marketing, Inc., ConocoPhillips Company, Devon Gas
    Services, L.P., Enbridge Marketing (US) L.P., Iberdrola
    Renewables, Inc., National Fuel Marketing Company, LLC, ONEOK
    Energy Services Company L.P., Tenaska Marketing and Atmos Energy
    Marketing, LLC, our natural gas marketing subsidiary.

The combination of base load, peaking and spot purchase
    agreements, coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage,
    allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather, which
    minimizes our need to enter into long-term firm commitments. We
    estimate our

peak-day

availability of natural gas supply to be approximately
    4.2 Bcf. The

peak-day

demand for our natural gas distribution operations in fiscal
    2009 was on January 15, 2009, when sales to customers
    reached approximately 3.1 Bcf.

To maintain our deliveries to high priority customers, we have
    the ability, and have exercised our right, to curtail deliveries
    to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts
    or applicable state regulations or statutes. Our customers’
    demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our
    ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or
    immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the
    physical limitations of gathering, storage and transmission
    systems, the duration and severity of cold weather, the



availability of gas reserves from our suppliers, the ability to
    purchase additional supplies on a short-term basis and actions
    by federal and state regulatory authorities. Curtailment rights
    provide us the flexibility to meet the human-needs requirements
    of our customers on a firm basis. Priority allocations imposed
    by federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as other
    factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to meet the
    demands of our customers. We anticipate no problems with
    obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers.

The following briefly describes our six natural gas distribution
    divisions. We operate in our service areas under terms of
    non-exclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities
    and towns that we serve. At September 30, 2009, we held
    1,111 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to
    35 years. A significant number of our franchises expire
    each year, which require renewal prior to the end of their
    terms. We believe that we will be able to renew our franchises
    as they expire. Additional information concerning our natural
    gas distribution divisions is presented under the caption
    “Operating Statistics”.

Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division.

Our Mid-Tex
    Division serves approximately 550 incorporated and
    unincorporated communities in the north-central, eastern and
    western parts of Texas, including the Dallas/Fort Worth
    Metroplex. The governing body of each municipality we serve has
    original jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates,
    operations and services within its city limits, except with
    respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel and
    agricultural use. The Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) has
    exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory
    orders and ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive
    original jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not
    located within the limits of a municipality.

Prior to fiscal 2008, this division operated under one
    system-wide rate structure. However, in 2008, we reached a
    settlement with cities representing approximately
    80 percent of this division’s customers (Settled
    Cities) that has allowed us, beginning in 2008, to update rates
    for customers in these cities through an annual rate review
    mechanism. Rates for the remaining 20 percent of this
    division’s customers, primarily the City of Dallas,
    continue to be updated through periodic formal rate proceedings
    and filings made under Texas’ Gas Reliability
    Infrastructure Program (GRIP). GRIP allows us to include in our
    rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior
    calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at
    least once every five years.

Atmos Energy Kentucky/Mid-States Division.

Our
    Kentucky/Mid-States Division operates in more than 420
    communities across Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri,
    Tennessee and Virginia. The service areas in these states are
    primarily rural; however, this division serves Franklin,
    Tennessee, and other suburban areas of Nashville. We update our
    rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings made
    with each state’s public service commission.

Atmos Energy Louisiana Division.

In Louisiana,
    we serve nearly 300 communities, including the suburban areas of
    New Orleans, the metropolitan area of Monroe and western
    Louisiana. Direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers
    in Louisiana, who use gas for fuel or in manufacturing
    processes, and sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel are exempt
    from regulation and are recognized in our natural gas marketing
    segment. Our rates in this division are updated annually through
    a rate stabilization clause filing without filing a formal rate
    case.

Atmos Energy West Texas Division.

Our West
    Texas Division serves approximately 80 communities in West
    Texas, including the Amarillo, Lubbock and Midland areas. Like
    our Mid-Tex Division, each municipality we serve has original
    jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates, operations and
    services within its city limits, with the RRC having exclusive
    appellate jurisdiction over the municipalities and exclusive
    original jurisdiction over rates and services provided to
    customers not located within the limits of a municipality. Prior
    to fiscal 2008, rates were updated in this division through
    formal rate proceedings. However, the West Texas Division
    entered into agreements with its West Texas service areas during
    2008 and its Amarillo and Lubbock service area during 2009 to
    update rates for customers in these service areas through an
    annual rate review mechanism.

Atmos Energy Mississippi Division.

In
    Mississippi, we serve about 110 communities throughout the
    northern half of the state, including the Jackson metropolitan
    area. Our rates in the Mississippi Division are updated annually
    through a stable rate filing without filing a formal rate case.



Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division.

Our
    Colorado-Kansas Division serves approximately 170 communities
    throughout Colorado and Kansas and parts of Missouri, including
    the cities of Olathe, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City and
    Greeley, Colorado, located near Denver. We update our rates in
    this division through periodic formal rate filings made with
    each state’s public service commission.

Regulated
    Transmission and Storage Segment Overview

Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the
    regulated pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division. This division transports
    natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division, transports natural gas for
    third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in
    Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary in the
    pipeline industry including parking arrangements, lending and
    sales of inventory on hand. Parking arrangements provide
    short-term interruptible storage of gas on our pipeline.



Lending services provide short-term interruptible loans of
    natural gas from our pipeline to meet market demands. Gross
    profit earned from our Mid-Tex Division and through certain
    other transportation and storage services is subject to
    traditional ratemaking governed by the RRC. However, Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas’ existing regulatory mechanisms
    allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided
    under market-based rates with minimal regulation.

These operations include one of the largest intrastate pipeline
    operations in Texas with a heavy concentration in the
    established natural gas-producing areas of central, northern and
    eastern Texas, extending into or near the major producing areas
    of the Texas Gulf Coast and the Delaware and Val Verde Basins of
    West Texas. Nine basins located in Texas are believed to contain
    a substantial portion of the nation’s remaining onshore
    natural gas reserves. This pipeline system provides access to
    all of these basins.

Natural
    Gas Marketing Segment Overview

Our natural gas marketing activities are conducted through Atmos
    Energy Marketing (AEM), which is wholly-owned by Atmos Energy
    Holdings, Inc. (AEH). AEH is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEC
    and operates primarily in the Midwest and Southeast areas of the
    United States.

AEM’s primary business is to aggregate and purchase gas
    supply, arrange transportation and storage logistics and
    ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices. In
    addition, AEM utilizes proprietary and customer-owned
    transportation and storage assets to provide various services
    our customers request, including furnishing natural gas supplies
    at fixed and market-based prices, contract negotiation and
    administration, load forecasting, gas storage acquisition and
    management services, transportation services, peaking sales and
    balancing services, capacity utilization strategies and gas
    price hedging through the use of financial instruments. AEM
    serves most of its customers under contracts generally having
    one to two year terms and sells natural gas to some of its
    industrial customers on a delivered burner tip basis under
    contract terms ranging from 30 days to two years. As a
    result, AEM’s margins arise from the types of commercial
    transactions we have structured with our customers and our
    ability to identify the lowest cost alternative among the
    natural gas supplies, transportation and markets to which it has
    access to serve those customers.

AEM also seeks to maximize, through asset optimization
    activities, the economic value associated with the storage and
    transportation capacity we own or control in our natural gas
    distribution and natural gas marketing segments. We attempt to
    meet this objective by engaging in natural gas storage
    transactions in which we seek to find and profit through the
    arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by
    recognizing pricing differences that occur over time. This
    process involves purchasing physical natural gas, storing it in
    the storage and transportation assets to which AEM has access
    and selling financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock
    in a gross profit margin.

Pipeline,
    Storage and Other Segment Overview

Our pipeline, storage and other segment primarily consists of
    the operations of Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC (APS), which
    is wholly-owned by AEH. APS is engaged in nonregulated
    transmission, storage and natural gas gathering services. Its
    primary asset is a proprietary 21 mile pipeline located in
    New Orleans, Louisiana. It also owns or controls additional
    pipeline and storage capacity including interests in underground
    storage fields in Kentucky and Louisiana that are used to reduce
    the need of our natural gas distribution divisions to contract
    for pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak
    periods.

APS’ primary business is to provide storage and
    transportation services to our Louisiana and Kentucky/MidStates
    regulated natural gas distribution divisions, to our natural gas
    marketing segment and, on a more limited basis, to third
    parties. APS earns transportation fees and storage demand
    charges to aggregate and provide gas supply, provide access to
    storage capacity and transport gas for these customers.

APS also engages in various asset optimization activities.
    APS’ primary asset optimization activity involves the
    administration of two asset management plans with regulated
    affiliates of the Company. These arrangements provide APS the
    opportunity to maximize the economic value associated with the
    transportation and storage capacity assigned to these plans. APS
    attempts to meet this objective through a variety of activities
    including engaging in natural gas storage transactions and
    utilizing excess asset capacity to find and profit through the
    arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by
    recognizing pricing differences that occur over time. These
    plans require APS to share a portion of the economic value
    created by these activities with the regulated customers served
    by these affiliates. These arrangements have been approved by
    applicable state regulatory commissions and are subject to
    annual regulatory review intended to ensure proper allocation of
    economic value between our regulated customers and APS.

APS also seeks to maximize the economic value associated with
    the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls. We
    attempt to meet this objective by engaging in natural gas
    storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit through
    the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by
    recognizing pricing differences that occur over time. This
    process involves purchasing physical natural gas, storing it in
    the storage and transportation assets to which APS has access
    and, in transactions involving storage capacity, selling
    financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross
    profit margin.

Ratemaking
    Activity

Overview

The method of determining regulated rates varies among the
    states in which our natural gas distribution divisions operate.
    The regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring
    that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best
    interests of customers while providing utility companies the
    opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment.
    Generally, each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and
    establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue
    sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to
    provide a reasonable return on invested capital.

Our current rate strategy is to focus on reducing or eliminating
    regulatory lag, obtaining adequate returns and providing stable,
    predictable margins. Atmos Energy has annual ratemaking
    mechanisms in place in three states that provide for an annual
    rate review and adjustment to rates for approximately
    68 percent of our customers. Additionally, we have WNA
    mechanisms in eight states. These mechanisms work in tandem to
    provide insulation from volatile margins, both for the Company
    and our customers.

We will also continue to address various rate design changes,
    including the recovery of bad debt gas costs, inclusion of other
    taxes in gas costs and stratification of rates to benefit low
    income households in future rate filings. These design changes
    would address cost variations that are related to pass-through
    energy costs beyond our control.

Although substantial progress has been made in recent years by
    improving rate design across Atmos’ operating area,
    potential changes in federal energy policy and adverse economic
    conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the Company
    and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these
    external factors.



Recent
    Ratemaking Activity

Substantially all of our natural gas distribution revenues in
    the fiscal years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007
    were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval
    by local or state authorities. Annual net operating income
    increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling
    $54.4 million, $40.6 million, and $45.2 million
    became effective in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 as summarized
    below:

A rate case is a formal request from Atmos Energy to a
    regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to
    customers. Rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory
    authorities request us to justify our rates. This process is
    referred to as a “show cause” action. Adequate rates
    are intended to provide for recovery of the Company’s costs
    as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure
    that we continue to deliver reliable, reasonably priced natural
    gas service to our customers. The following table summarizes our

Annual
    Rate Filing Mechanisms

As an instrument to reduce regulatory lag, annual rate filing
    mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on a periodic basis
    without filing a formal rate case. However, these filings still
    involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities
    prior to the final determination of rates under these
    mechanisms. As discussed above in “Natural Gas Distribution
    Segment Overview,” we currently have annual rate filing
    mechanisms in our Louisiana and Mississippi divisions and in
    significant portions of our Mid-Tex and West Texas divisions.
    These mechanisms are referred to as rate review mechanisms in
    our Mid-Tex and West Texas



divisions, stable rate filings in the Mississippi Division and
    rate stabilization clause in the Louisiana Division. The

The rate review mechanism in the Mid-Tex Division was entered
    into as a result of a settlement in the September 20, 2007
    Statement of Intent case filed with all Mid-Tex Division cities.
    Of the 439 incorporated cities served by the Mid-Tex Division,
    438 of these cities are part of the rate review mechanism
    process. The West Texas rate review mechanism was entered into
    in August 2008 as a result of a settlement with the West Texas
    Coalition of Cities. The Lubbock and Amarillo rate review
    mechanisms were entered into in the spring of 2009. All
    mechanisms have been implemented on a three year trial period,
    of which three began in fiscal 2009, based upon calendar 2007
    financial information and two of which began in fiscal 2009
    based on 2008 financial information. The third rate review
    mechanism in the Mid-Tex Division will be filed in March 2010
    based upon calendar 2009 financial information. This filing will
    be the last filing under the three year trial period.

In May 2007, our Mid-Tex Division filed for a

36-month

gas
    contract review filing. This filing was mandated by prior RRC
    orders and related to the prudency of gas purchases made from
    November 2003 through October 2006, which total approximately
    $2.7 billion. In February 2009, the RRC approved the
    Hearing Examiner’s recommendation to disallow no gas costs.

In March 2009, the RRC established a procedural schedule in GUD
    9696 to examine the

36-month

gas
    contract review process. In August 2009, the full Commission
    approved an order to eliminate the 36 month gas contract
    review at its August 2009 meeting.

Other
    Regulation

Each of our natural gas distribution divisions is regulated by
    various state or local public utility authorities. We are also
    subject to regulation by the United States Department of
    Transportation with respect to safety requirements in the
    operation and maintenance of our gas distribution facilities. In
    addition, our distribution operations are also subject to
    various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters.
    From time to time we receive inquiries regarding various
    environmental matters. We believe that our properties and
    operations substantially comply with and are operated in
    substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental
    statutes and regulations. There are no administrative or
    judicial proceedings arising under



environmental quality statutes pending or known to be
    contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a
    material adverse effect on us or our operations. Our
    environmental claims have arisen primarily from former
    manufactured gas plant sites in Tennessee, Iowa and Missouri.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allows, pursuant
    to Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, gas
    transportation services through our Atmos Pipeline —
    Texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or
    local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines,
    without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the FERC.
    Additionally, the FERC has regulatory authority over the sale of
    natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release
    of interstate pipeline and storage capacity, as well as
    authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to
    enforce compliance with FERC’s other rules, policies and
    orders by companies engaged in the sale, purchase,
    transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce.
    We have taken what we believe are all necessary and appropriate
    steps to comply with these regulations.

In September 2008, the RRC issued a final rule requiring the
    replacement of known compression couplings at pre-bent gas meter
    risers by November 2009. This rule primarily affected the
    operations of the Mid-Tex Division. Compliance with this rule
    has required us to expend significant amounts of capital in the
    Mid-Tex Division, but these prudent and mandatory expenditures
    have been recoverable through our rates. As of
    September 30, 2009 we had substantially completed our
    pre-bent riser replacement program in the Mid-Tex Division.

Competition

Although our natural gas distribution operations are not
    currently in significant direct competition with any other
    distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial
    customers within our service areas, we do compete with other
    natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for
    sales to industrial customers. We compete in all aspects of our
    business with alternative energy sources, including, in
    particular, electricity. Electric utilities offer electricity as
    a rival energy source and compete for the space heating, water
    heating and cooking markets. Promotional incentives, improved
    equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to
    the acceptability of electrical equipment. The principal means
    to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices, and
    natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in
    the residential, commercial and industrial markets. However,
    periods of higher gas prices, coupled with the electric
    utilities’ marketing efforts, increase competition for
    residential and commercial customers. In addition, AEM competes
    with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas
    management and other related services to customers.

Our regulated transmission and storage operations currently face
    limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and
    gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation,
    storage and other services for customers.

Employees

At September 30, 2009, we had 4,891 employees,
    consisting of 4,753 employees in our regulated operations
    and 138 employees in our nonregulated operations.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

Our financial and operating results are subject to a number of
    risk factors, many of which are not within our control. Although
    we have tried to discuss key risk factors below, please be aware
    that other or new risks may prove to be important in the future.
    Investors should carefully consider the following discussion of
    risk factors as well as other information appearing in this
    report. These factors include the following:

Further
    disruptions in the credit markets could limit our ability to
    access capital and increase our costs of capital.

We rely upon access to both short-term and long-term credit
    markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements. The global credit
    markets have experienced significant disruptions and volatility
    during the last two years to a greater degree than has been seen
    in decades. In some cases, the ability or willingness of
    traditional sources of capital to provide financing has been
    reduced.

Historically, we have accessed the commercial paper markets to
    finance our short-term working capital needs. The disruptions in
    the credit markets during the fall of 2008 temporarily limited
    our access to the commercial paper markets and increased our
    borrowing costs. Consequently, for a short period, we were
    forced to borrow directly under our primary credit facility that
    backstops our commercial paper program to provide much of our
    working capital. This credit facility provides up to
    $567 million in committed financing through its expiration
    in December 2011. Our borrowings under this facility, along with
    our commercial paper, have been used primarily to purchase
    natural gas supplies for the upcoming winter heating season. The
    amount of our working capital requirements in the near-term will
    depend primarily on the market price of natural gas. Higher
    natural gas prices may adversely impact our accounts receivable
    collections and may require us to increase borrowings under our
    credit facilities to fund our operations. The cost of both our
    borrowings under the primary credit facility and our commercial
    paper has increased significantly since September 2008. We have
    historically supplemented our commercial paper program with a
    short-term committed credit facility that must be renewed
    annually. No borrowings are currently outstanding under our
    current $200 million short-term facility, which matures in
    October 2010.

Our long-term debt is currently rated as “investment
    grade” by Standard & Poor’s Corporation,
    Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. If
    adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation
    on our access to the private and public credit markets, we could
    see a reduction in our liquidity. A significant reduction in our
    liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings
    outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more
    of the three credit rating agencies. Such a downgrade could
    further limit our access to public

and/or

private credit markets and increase the costs of borrowing under
    each source of credit.

Further, if our credit ratings were downgraded, we could be
    required to provide additional liquidity to our natural gas
    marketing segment because the commodity financial instruments
    markets could become unavailable to us. Our natural gas
    marketing segment depends primarily upon a committed
    $450 million credit facility to finance its working capital
    needs, which it uses primarily to issue standby letters of
    credit to its natural gas



suppliers. A significant reduction in the availability of this
    facility could require us to provide extra liquidity to support
    its operations or reduce some of the activities of our natural
    gas marketing segment. Our ability to provide extra liquidity is
    limited by the terms of our existing lending arrangements with
    AEH, which are subject to annual approval by one state
    regulatory commission.

While we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our
    operations and the sources of financing available to us, we can
    provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so
    in the future, especially if the market price of natural gas
    increases significantly in the near-term. The future effects on
    our business, liquidity and financial results of a further
    deterioration of current conditions in the credit markets could
    be material and adverse to us, both in the ways described above
    or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate.

The
    continuation of recent economic conditions could adversely
    affect our customers and negatively impact our financial
    results.

The slowdown in the U.S. economy, together with increased
    mortgage defaults and significant decreases in the values of
    homes and investment assets, has adversely affected the
    financial resources of many domestic households. It is unclear
    whether the administrative and legislative responses to these
    conditions will be successful in ending the current recession,
    including the lowering of current high unemployment rates across
    the U.S. As a result, our customers may seek to use even
    less gas and it may become more difficult for them to pay their
    gas bills. This may slow collections and lead to higher than
    normal levels of accounts receivable. This in turn could
    increase our financing requirements and bad debt expense.

The
    costs of providing pension and postretirement health care
    benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes
    in pension fund values, changing demographics and fluctuating
    actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse effect on
    our financial results.

We provide a cash-balance pension plan and postretirement
    healthcare benefits to eligible full-time employees. Our costs
    of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are
    subject to changes in the market value of the assets funding our
    pension and postretirement healthcare plans. The fluctuations
    over the last two years in the values of investments that fund
    our pension and postretirement healthcare plans may
    significantly differ from or alter the values and actuarial
    assumptions we use to calculate our future pension plan expense
    and postretirement healthcare costs and funding requirements
    under the Pension Protection Act. Any significant declines in
    the value of these investments could increase the expenses of
    our pension and postretirement healthcare plans and related
    funding requirements in the future. Our costs of providing such
    benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to
    changing demographics, including longer life expectancy of
    beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible
    former employees over the next five to ten years, as well as
    various actuarial calculations and assumptions, which may differ
    materially from actual results due to changing market and
    economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates and
    interest rates and other factors.

Our
    operations are exposed to market risks that are beyond our
    control which could adversely affect our financial results and
    capital requirements.

Our risk management operations are subject to market risks
    beyond our control, including market liquidity, commodity price
    volatility and counterparty creditworthiness. Although we
    maintain a risk management policy, we may not be able to
    completely offset the price risk associated with volatile gas
    prices or the risk in our natural gas marketing and pipeline,
    storage and other segments, which could lead to volatility in
    our earnings. Physical trading also introduces price risk on any
    net open positions at the end of each trading day, as well as
    volatility resulting from

intra-day

fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price
    movements between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for
    future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is
    hedged. Although we manage our business to maintain no open
    positions, there are times when limited net open positions
    related to our physical storage may occur on a short-term basis.
    The determination of our net open position as of the end of any
    particular trading day requires us to make assumptions as to
    future circumstances, including the use of gas by our customers
    in relation to our anticipated



storage and market positions. Because the price risk associated
    with any net open position at the end of such day may increase
    if the assumptions are not realized, we review these assumptions
    as part of our daily monitoring activities. Net open positions
    may increase volatility in our financial condition or results of
    operations if market prices move in a significantly favorable or
    unfavorable manner because the timing of the recognition of
    profits or losses on the hedges for financial accounting
    purposes usually do not match up with the timing of the economic
    profits or losses on the item being hedged. This volatility may
    occur with a resulting increase or decrease in earnings or
    losses, even though the expected profit margin is essentially
    unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated.
    Further, if the local physical markets in which we trade do not
    move consistently with the NYMEX futures market, we could
    experience increased volatility in the financial results of our
    natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments.

Our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other
    segments manage margins and limit risk exposure on the sale of
    natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixed-price purchase or
    sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through
    the use of a variety of financial instruments. However,
    contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to
    withdraw gas from storage, which could cause us to purchase gas
    at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes
    to fulfill customer contracts. We could also realize financial
    losses on our efforts to limit risk as a result of volatility in
    the market prices of the underlying commodities or if a
    counterparty fails to perform under a contract. Further
    tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our
    counterparties to fail to perform than expected. In addition,
    adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties
    could limit the level of trading activities with these parties
    and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a
    contract. These circumstances could also increase our capital
    requirements.

We are also subject to interest rate risk on our borrowings. In
    recent years, we have been operating in a relatively low
    interest-rate environment with both short and long-term interest
    rates being relatively low compared to historical interest
    rates. However, increases in interest rates could adversely
    affect our future financial results.

We are
    subject to state and local regulations that affect our
    operations and financial results.

Our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and
    storage segments are subject to various regulated returns on our
    rate base in each jurisdiction in which we operate. We monitor
    the allowed rates of return and our effectiveness in earning
    such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating changes as
    we believe are needed. In addition, in the normal course of
    business in the regulatory environment, assets may be placed in
    service and historical test periods established before rate
    cases can be filed that could result in an adjustment of our
    allowed returns. Once rate cases are filed, regulatory bodies
    have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates
    while studying the cases. Because of this process, we must
    suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in
    service without the benefit of rate relief, which is commonly
    referred to as “regulatory lag.” Rate cases also
    involve a risk of rate reduction, because once rates have been
    approved, they are still subject to challenge for their
    reasonableness by appropriate regulatory authorities. In
    addition, regulators may review our purchases of natural gas and
    can adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to
    our customers. Finally, our debt and equity financings are also
    subject to approval by regulatory commissions in several states,
    which could limit our ability to access or take advantage of
    changes in the capital markets.

Some
    of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory
    oversight that could affect our operations and financial
    results.

FERC has regulatory authority that affects some of our
    operations, including sales of natural gas in the wholesale gas
    market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and
    storage capacity. Under legislation passed by Congress in 2005,
    FERC has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse
    and market manipulation and to promote compliance with
    FERC’s other rules, policies and orders by companies
    engaged in the sale, purchase, transportation or storage of
    natural gas in interstate commerce. These rules carry increased
    penalties for violations. We are currently under investigation
    by FERC for possible violations of its posting and competitive
    bidding regulations for pre-arranged released firm capacity on
    interstate natural gas



pipelines. Should FERC conclude that we have committed such
    violations of its regulations and levies substantial fines

and/or

penalties against us, our business, financial condition or
    financial results could be adversely affected. In addition,
    although we have taken steps to structure current and future
    transactions to comply with applicable current FERC regulations,
    changes in FERC regulations or their interpretation by FERC or
    additional regulations issued by FERC in the future could also
    adversely affect our business, financial condition or financial
    results.

We are
    subject to environmental regulations which could adversely
    affect our operations or financial results.

We are subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements
    enacted or adopted by federal, state and local governmental
    authorities relating to protection of the environment and health
    and safety matters, including those legal requirements that
    govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the
    management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, the

clean-up

of
    contaminated sites, groundwater quality and availability, plant
    and wildlife protection, as well as work practices related to
    employee health and safety. Environmental legislation also
    requires that our facilities, sites and other properties
    associated with our operations be operated, maintained,
    abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable
    regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with these laws,
    regulations, permits and licenses may expose us to fines,
    penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be
    significant to our financial results. In addition, existing
    environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may
    become subject to new regulations.

Our
    business may be subject in the future to additional regulatory
    and financial risks associated with global warming and climate
    change.

There are a number of new federal and state legislative and
    regulatory initiatives being proposed and adopted in an attempt
    to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall
    climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions, such as
    carbon dioxide. For example, in June 2009, the U.S. House
    of Representatives approved

The American Clean Energy and
    Security Act of 2009

, also known as the Waxman-Markey bill
    or “cap and trade” bill. The legislation, which
    strives to promote energy efficiency in the United States and
    reduce the amount of greenhouse gases produced, has implications
    for the natural gas industry. The bill, if adopted, would
    accelerate significantly the reduction in energy use per
    customer through a number of measures, including a dramatic
    tightening of building and appliance codes and other practices
    designed to put an increased focus on building and appliance
    efficiency. According to the bill, overall nationwide energy
    savings would total 75 percent by the year 2030 as a result
    of adopting its provisions. If adopted, the Waxman-Markey bill
    would establish a phased-in greenhouse gas emission

cap-and-trade

program that would reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions from
    capped sources by 17 percent by 2020 compared to emissions
    from such sources in 2005. These caps would be postponed on
    natural gas residential and commercial customers until 2016.
    Subsequent to the adoption by the House of this bill, a similar
    bill was introduced in the U.S. Senate, entitled the

Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act,

also known as
    the Kerry-Boxer bill. At this time, the Kerry-Boxer bill is
    awaiting Senate action. The adoption of this legislation by
    Congress or similar legislation by states or the adoption of
    related regulations by federal or state governments mandating a
    substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could have
    far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry.
    Such new legislation or regulations could result in increased
    compliance costs for us or additional operating restrictions on
    our business, affect the demand for natural gas or impact the
    prices we charge to our customers. At this time, we cannot
    predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations on our
    future business, financial condition or financial results.

The
    concentration of our distribution, pipeline and storage
    operations in the State of Texas exposes our operations and
    financial results to economic conditions and regulatory
    decisions in Texas.

Over 50 percent of our natural gas distribution customers
    and most of our pipeline and storage assets and operations are
    located in the State of Texas. This concentration of our
    business in Texas means that our operations and financial
    results may be significantly affected by changes in the Texas
    economy in general and regulatory decisions by state and local
    regulatory authorities in Texas.



Adverse
    weather conditions could affect our operations or financial
    results.

Since the

2006-2007

winter heating season, we have had weather-normalized rates for
    over 90 percent of our residential and commercial meters,
    which has substantially mitigated the adverse effects of

warmer-than-normal

weather for meters in those service areas. However, there is no
    assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory
    protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future. The
    loss of such weather — normalized rates could have an
    adverse effect on our operations and financial results. In
    addition, our natural gas distribution and regulated
    transmission and storage operating results may continue to vary
    somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating
    season. Sustained cold weather could adversely affect our
    natural gas marketing operations as we may be required to
    purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain
    sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts.

Inflation
    and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base
    and customer collections and increase our level of
    indebtedness.

Inflation has caused increases in some of our operating expenses
    and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs. We have
    a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our
    natural gas distribution gas rates in relation to the increasing
    cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in
    adjusting those gas rates. Historically, we have been able to
    budget and control operating expenses and investments within the
    amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to
    continue to do so. However, the ability to control expenses is
    an important factor that could impact future financial results.

Rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to
    experience a significant increase in short-term debt. We must
    pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased, which can be
    significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered
    through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas
    delivered. Increases in purchased gas costs also slow our
    natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are
    more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills, leading to
    higher than normal accounts receivable. This could result in
    higher short-term debt levels, greater collection efforts and
    increased bad debt expense.

Our
    growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our
    business, which requires extensive capital
    spending.

We must continually build additional capacity in our natural gas
    distribution system to enable us to adequately serve any
    significant amount of additional customers. The cost of adding
    this capacity may be affected by a number of factors, including
    the general state of the economy and weather. Our cash flows
    from operations generally are sufficient to supply funding for
    all our capital expenditures, including the financing of the
    costs of new construction along with capital expenditures
    necessary to maintain our existing natural gas system. Due to
    the timing of these cash flows and capital expenditures, we
    often must fund at least a portion of these costs through
    borrowing funds from third party lenders, the cost and
    availability of which is dependent on the liquidity of the
    credit markets, interest rates and other market conditions. This
    in turn may limit our ability to connect new customers to our
    system due to constraints on the amount of funds we can invest
    in our infrastructure.

Our
    operations are subject to increased competition.

In residential and commercial customer markets, our natural gas
    distribution operations compete with other energy products, such
    as electricity and propane. Our primary product competition is
    with electricity for heating, water heating and cooking.
    Increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact
    our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of
    natural gas to the consumer. This could adversely impact our
    business if, as a result, our customer growth slows, reducing
    our ability to make capital expenditures, or if our customers
    further conserve their use of gas, resulting in reduced gas
    purchases and customer billings.

In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing
    plants, adverse economic conditions, including higher gas costs,
    could cause these customers to use alternative sources of
    energy, such as electricity, or bypass our systems in favor of
    special competitive contracts with lower

per-unit

costs. Our regulated transmission and



storage segment currently faces limited competition from other
    existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to
    provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services
    for customers. However, competition may increase if new
    intrastate pipelines are constructed near our existing
    facilities.

Distributing
    and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in
    accidents and additional operating costs.

Our natural gas distribution business involves a number of
    hazards and operating risks that cannot be completely avoided,
    such as leaks, accidents and operational problems, which could
    cause loss of human life, as well as substantial financial
    losses resulting from property damage, damage to the environment
    and to our operations. We do have liability and property
    insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks.
    However, because our pipeline, storage and distribution
    facilities are near or are in populated areas, any loss of human
    life or adverse financial results resulting from such events
    could be large. If these events were not fully covered by
    insurance, our operations or financial results could be
    adversely affected.

Natural
    disasters, terrorist activities or other significant events
    could adversely affect our operations or financial
    results.

Natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and
    operations. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities
    could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in
    the price of natural gas that could affect our operations. Also,
    companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure
    to actual acts of terrorism, which could subject our operations
    to increased risks. As a result, the availability of insurance
    covering such risks may be more limited, which could increase
    the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or
    financial results.

Properties.

Distribution,
    transmission and related assets

At September 30, 2009, our natural gas distribution segment
    owned an aggregate of 70,879 miles of underground
    distribution and transmission mains throughout our gas
    distribution systems. These mains are located on easements or

rights-of-way

which generally provide for perpetual use. We maintain our mains
    through a program of continuous inspection and repair and
    believe that our system of mains is in good condition. Our
    regulated transmission and storage segment owned
    5,950 miles of gas transmission and gathering lines and our
    pipeline, storage and other segment owned 113 miles of gas
    transmission and gathering lines.



Storage
    Assets

We own underground gas storage facilities in several states to
    supplement the supply of natural gas in periods of peak demand.

Dividends are payable at the discretion of our Board of
    Directors out of legally available funds. The Board of Directors
    typically declares dividends in the same fiscal quarter in which
    they are paid. The number of record holders of our common stock
    on October 31, 2009 was 20,824. Future payments of
    dividends, and the amounts of these dividends, will depend on
    our financial condition, results of operations, capital
    requirements and other factors. We sold no securities during
    fiscal 2009 that were not registered under the Securities Act of
    1933, as amended.



Performance
    Graph

The performance graph and table below compares the yearly
    percentage change in our total return to shareholders for the
    last five fiscal years with the total return of the Standard and
    Poor’s 500 Stock Index and the cumulative total return of
    two different customized peer company groups, the New Comparison
    Company Index and the Old Comparison Company Index. The New
    Comparison Company Index includes National Fuel Gas and excludes
    Questar Corporation because the Board of Directors determined
    that National Fuel Gas better fits the profile of the companies
    in the peer group, which is comprised of natural gas
    distribution companies with similar revenues, market
    capitalizations and asset bases to that of the Company. The
    graph and table below assume that $100.00 was invested on
    September 30, 2004 in our common stock, the S&P 500
    Index and in the common stock of the companies in the New and
    Old Comparison Company Indexes, as well as a reinvestment of
    dividends paid on such investments throughout the period.

ITEM 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

INTRODUCTION

This section provides management’s discussion of the
    financial condition, changes in financial condition and results
    of operations of Atmos Energy Corporation and its consolidated
    subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations
    and liquidity and capital resources. It includes
    management’s interpretation of our financial results, the
    factors affecting these results, the major factors expected to
    affect future operating results and future investment and
    financing plans. This discussion should be read in conjunction
    with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

Several factors exist that could influence our future financial
    performance, some of which are described in Item 1A above,
    “Risk Factors”. They should be considered in
    connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained
    in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since
    these factors could cause actual results and conditions to
    differ materially from those set out in such forward-looking
    statements.

Cautionary
    Statement for the Purposes of the Safe Harbor under the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

The statements contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

may contain “forward-looking statements” within the
    meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All
    statements other than statements of historical fact included in
    this Report are forward-looking statements made in good faith by
    us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from
    liability established by the Private Securities Litigation
    Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, or any other of
    our documents or oral presentations, the words
    “anticipate”, “believe”,
    “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”,
    “goal”, “intend”, “objective”,
    “plan”, “projection”, “seek”,
    “strategy” or similar words are intended to identify
    forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are
    subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
    results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in
    the statements relating to our strategy, operations, markets,
    services, rates, recovery of costs, availability of gas supply
    and other factors. These risks and uncertainties include the
    following: our ability to continue to access the credit markets
    to satisfy our liquidity requirements; the impact of recent
    economic conditions on our customers; increased costs of
    providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and
    increased funding requirements; market risks beyond our control
    affecting our risk management activities including market
    liquidity, commodity price volatility, increasing interest rates
    and counterparty creditworthiness; regulatory trends and
    decisions, including the impact of rate proceedings before
    various state regulatory commissions; increased federal
    regulatory oversight and potential penalties; the impact of
    environmental regulations on our business; the possible impact
    of future additional regulatory and financial risks associated
    with global warming and climate change; the concentration of our
    distribution, pipeline and storage operations in Texas; adverse
    weather conditions; the effects of inflation and changes in the
    availability and price of natural gas; the capital-intensive
    nature of our gas distribution business; increased competition
    from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy; the
    inherent hazards and risks involved in operating our gas
    distribution business, natural disasters, terrorist activities
    or other events, and other risks and uncertainties discussed
    herein, especially those discussed in Item 1A above, all of
    which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our
    control. Accordingly, while we believe these forward-looking
    statements to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they
    will approximate actual experience or that the expectations
    derived from them will be realized. Further, we undertake no
    obligation to update or revise any of our forward-looking
    statements whether as a result of new information, future events
    or otherwise.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States. Preparation of these financial statements
    requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
    and the related disclosures of contingent assets and
    liabilities. We based our estimates on historical experience and
    various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
    the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate



our estimates, including those related to risk management and
    trading activities, fair value measurements, allowance for
    doubtful accounts, legal and environmental accruals, insurance
    accruals, pension and postretirement obligations, deferred
    income taxes and valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived
    intangible assets and other long-lived assets. Our critical
    accounting policies are reviewed by the Audit Committee
    quarterly. Actual results may differ from estimates.

Regulation

— Our natural gas distribution and
    regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to
    regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of
    accounting records and various other matters by the respective
    regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. We
    meet the criteria established within accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of a cost-based,
    rate-regulated entity, which requires us to reflect the
    financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and
    policies of the various regulatory commissions in our financial
    statements in accordance with applicable authoritative
    accounting standards. We apply the provisions of this standard
    to our regulated operations and record regulatory assets for
    costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through
    customer rates is considered probable and regulatory liabilities
    when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts
    that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking
    process. As a result, certain costs that would normally be
    expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the
    balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered
    through rates. Discontinuing the application of this method of
    accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could
    significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs
    would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet,
    which could reduce our net income. Further, regulation may
    impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized.
    The amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon
    historical experience and our understanding of the regulations.
    The impact of regulation on our regulated operations may be
    affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the
    issuance of new regulations.

Revenue recognition

— Sales of natural gas to
    our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly
    basis; however, the billing cycle periods for certain classes of
    customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods
    used for financial reporting purposes. We follow the revenue
    accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution
    segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to
    customers, but not yet billed under the cycle billing method,
    are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to
    expense.

On occasion, we are permitted to implement new rates that have
    not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities, which
    are subject to refund. We recognize this revenue and establish a
    reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our
    experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were
    implemented.

Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for
    increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through
    purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas cost
    adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of
    recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without
    filing a rate case to address all of the utility company’s
    non-gas costs. These mechanisms are commonly utilized when
    regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of cost, such
    as purchased gas costs, that (i) is subject to significant
    price fluctuations compared to the utility company’s other
    costs, (ii) represents a large component of the utility
    company’s cost of service and (iii) is generally
    outside the control of the gas utility company. There is no
    gross profit generated through purchased gas cost adjustments,
    but they provide a

dollar-for-dollar

offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs. Although
    substantially all natural gas distribution sales to our
    customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase, our
    gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the
    cost of gas as a result of the purchased gas cost adjustment
    mechanism. The effects of these purchased gas cost adjustment
    mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance
    sheet.

Operating revenues for our regulated transmission and storage
    and pipeline, storage and other segments are recognized in the
    period in which actual volumes are transported and storage
    services are provided.

Operating revenues for our natural gas marketing segment and the
    associated carrying value of natural gas inventory (inclusive of
    storage costs) are recognized when we sell the gas and
    physically deliver it to our customers. Operating revenues
    include realized gains and losses arising from the settlement of
    financial



instruments used in our natural gas marketing activities and
    unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair
    value of natural gas inventory designated as a hedged item in a
    fair value hedge and the associated financial instruments.

Allowance for doubtful accounts

— Accounts
    receivable arise from natural gas sales to residential,
    commercial, industrial, municipal and other customers. For the
    majority of our receivables, we establish an allowance for
    doubtful accounts based on our collections experience. On
    certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific
    customer’s inability or reluctance to pay, we record an
    allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce
    the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to
    collect. However, if circumstances change, our estimate of the
    recoverability of accounts receivable could be affected.
    Circumstances which could affect our estimates include, but are
    not limited to, customer credit issues, the level of natural gas
    prices, customer deposits and general economic conditions.
    Accounts are written off once they are deemed to be
    uncollectible.

Financial instruments and hedging activities

— We currently use financial instruments to
    mitigate commodity price risk. Additionally, we periodically use
    financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. The
    objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have
    been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and
    nonregulated businesses.

We record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet
    at fair value as required by accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States

,

with changes in fair value
    ultimately recorded in the income statement. The timing of when
    changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recorded
    in the income statement depends on whether the financial
    instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a
    hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a
    different accounting treatment. Changes in fair value for
    financial instruments that do not meet one of these criteria are
    recognized in the income statement as they occur.

Financial
    Instruments Associated with Commodity Price Risk

In our natural gas distribution segment, our customers are
    exposed to the effect of volatile natural gas prices. We manage
    this exposure through a combination of physical storage,
    fixed-price forward contracts and financial instruments,
    primarily

over-the-counter

swap and option contracts, in an effort to minimize the impact
    of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the
    winter heating season. The costs associated with and the gains
    and losses arising from the use of financial instruments to
    mitigate commodity price risk in this segment are included in
    our purchased gas adjustment mechanisms in accordance with
    regulatory requirements. Therefore, changes in the fair value of
    these financial instruments are initially recorded as a
    component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the
    consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas
    cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and
    recognized in revenue in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, there is
    no earnings impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a
    result of the use of financial instruments.

Our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas
    supply, arranges transportation

and/or

storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers
    at competitive prices. We also perform asset optimization
    activities in both our natural gas marketing segment and
    pipeline, storage and other segment. As a result of these
    activities, our nonregulated operations are exposed to risks
    associated with changes in the market price of natural gas. We
    manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes
    through a combination of physical storage and financial
    instruments, including futures,

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with
    counterparties.

In our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other
    segments, we have designated the natural gas inventory held by
    these operating segments as the hedged item in a fair-value
    hedge. This inventory is marked to market at the end of each
    month based on the Gas Daily index, with changes in fair value
    recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the
    period of change. The financial instruments associated with this
    natural gas inventory have been designated as fair-value hedges
    and are marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price
    with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or
    losses in revenue in the period of change. Changes in the
    spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the
    financial instruments designated against our physical inventory
    (NYMEX) and the market (spot) prices used to value



our physical storage (Gas Daily) result in unrealized margins
    until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related
    financial instruments are settled. The difference in the spot
    price used to value our physical inventory and the forward price
    used to value the related financial instruments can result in
    volatility in our reported income as a component of unrealized
    margins. We have elected to exclude this spot/forward
    differential for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of
    these fair-value hedges. Once the gas is withdrawn and the
    financial instruments are settled, the previously unrealized
    margins associated with these net positions are realized. Over
    time, we expect gains and losses on the sale of storage gas
    inventory to be offset by gains and losses on the fair-value
    hedges, resulting in the realization of the economic gross
    profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the
    original transaction.

We have elected to treat fixed-price forward contracts used in
    our natural gas marketing segment to deliver gas as normal
    purchases and normal sales. As such, these deliveries are
    recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with our revenue
    recognition policy. Financial instruments used to mitigate the
    commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been
    designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and
    sales at indexed prices. Accordingly, unrealized gains and
    losses on open financial instruments are recorded as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in
    earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are
    sold. Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred, is reported
    as a component of revenue.

We also use storage swaps and futures to capture additional
    storage arbitrage opportunities in our natural gas marketing
    segment that arise after the execution of the original fair
    value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory,
    basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our
    fixed price and storage books and various

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options. These financial instruments have
    not been designated as hedges.

Financial
    Instruments Associated with Interest Rate Risk

We periodically manage interest rate risk, typically when we
    issue new or refinance existing long-term debt. As of
    September 30, 2009, we had no financial instruments in
    place to manage interest rate risk. However, in prior years, we
    entered into Treasury lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield
    component of the interest cost associated with anticipated
    financings. We designated these Treasury lock agreements as a
    cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction at the time the
    agreements were executed. Accordingly, unrealized gains and
    losses associated with the Treasury lock agreements were
    recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss). The realized gain or loss recognized upon
    settlement of each Treasury lock agreement was initially
    recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) and is recognized as a component of interest
    expense over the life of the related financing arrangement.

Impairment assessments

— We perform impairment
    assessments of our goodwill, intangible assets subject to
    amortization and long-lived assets. As of September 30,
    2009, we had no indefinite-lived intangible assets.

We annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during
    our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise. We
    use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to
    estimate the fair value of our reporting units. We have
    determined our reporting units to be each of our natural gas
    distribution divisions and wholly-owned subsidiaries and
    goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the
    acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill. The discounted cash
    flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are
    dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of
    future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rate. An
    impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a
    reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value.

We annually assess whether the cost of our intangible assets
    subject to amortization or other long-lived assets is
    recoverable or that the remaining useful lives may warrant
    revision. We perform this assessment more frequently when
    specific events or circumstances have occurred that suggest the
    recoverability of the cost of the intangible and other
    long-lived assets is at risk.

When such events or circumstances are present, we assess the
    recoverability of these assets by determining whether the
    carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash
    flows from the



operating division or subsidiary to which these assets relate.
    These cash flow projections consider various factors such as the
    timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are
    based upon the best information available at the time the
    estimate is made. Changes in these factors could materially
    affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition
    of an impairment charge. An impairment charge is recognized as
    the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if
    the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying
    value of the related asset.

Pension and other postretirement plans —

Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities
    are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by
    numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of
    plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets,
    assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial
    mortality data. Prior to fiscal 2009, we reviewed the estimates
    and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement
    plan costs and liabilities annually based upon a June 30
    measurement date. Effective October 1, 2008, we changed our
    measurement date to September 30. The assumed discount rate
    and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have
    the most significant impact on our pension costs and
    liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health care
    cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have
    the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and
    liabilities.

The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the
    actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement
    obligations and net pension and postretirement costs. When
    establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality
    corporate bond rates, changes in those rates from the prior year
    and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our
    projected benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate
    bond spot rate curve.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in
    calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our
    annual pension and postretirement plan costs. We estimate the
    expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond
    returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of
    active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset
    rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the
    guidance from our investment advisors in making a final
    determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the
    extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the
    course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate,
    that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan costs are
    not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases
    future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of
    approximately ten to twelve years.

We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in
    determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual
    health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted
    legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of
    retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our
    participant census information as of the measurement date.

Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and
    differences between the actual return on plan assets and the
    expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on
    the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized. A
    0.25 percent change in our discount rate would impact our
    pension and postretirement costs by approximately
    $0.8 million. A 0.25 percent change in our expected
    rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs
    by approximately $0.9 million.

Fair Value Measurements

— We report certain
    assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the
    price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
    transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants at the measurement date (exit price). We primarily
    use quoted market prices and other observable market pricing
    information in valuing our financial assets and liabilities and
    minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our
    measurements.

Prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to
    determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities
    recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. Within our
    nonregulated operations, we utilize a mid-market pricing
    convention (the mid-point between the bid and ask prices) as a
    practical expedient for determining fair value measurement, as
    permitted under current accounting standards. Values derived
    from these sources reflect the market in which transactions
    involving these financial instruments are executed. We



utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair
    value when external sources are not available. Values are
    adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly
    liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time
    under then-current market conditions. We believe the market
    prices and models used to value these assets and liabilities
    represent the best information available with respect to closing
    exchange and

over-the-counter

quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the
    assets and liabilities.

Fair-value estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and
    the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved. Our
    counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and
    major energy companies. This concentration of counterparties may
    materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from
    market, economic or regulatory conditions. Recent adverse
    developments in the global financial and credit markets have
    made it more difficult and more expensive for companies to
    access the short-term capital markets, which may negatively
    impact the creditworthiness of our counterparties. A continued
    tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our
    counterparties to fail to perform. We seek to minimize
    counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their
    financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral
    requirements under certain circumstances.

Amounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially
    significant volatility based upon changes in market prices, the
    valuation of the portfolio of our contracts, maturity and
    settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions,
    each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our
    financial instruments. We believe the market prices and models
    used to value these financial instruments represent the best
    information available with respect to closing exchange and

over-the-counter

quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the
    contracts. Values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact
    of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable
    period of time under then current market conditions.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

Overview

Atmos Energy Corporation is involved in the distribution,
    marketing and transportation of natural gas. Accordingly, our
    results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural
    gas, particularly during the winter heating season, and the
    volatility of the natural gas markets. This generally results in
    higher operating revenues and net income during the period from
    October through March of each fiscal year and lower operating
    revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the
    period from April through September of each fiscal year. As a
    result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry, our
    second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical
    earnings quarter with an average of approximately
    64 percent of our consolidated net income having been
    earned in the second quarter during the three most recently
    completed fiscal years.

Additionally, the seasonality of our business impacts our
    working capital differently at various times during the year.
    Typically, our accounts receivable, accounts payable and
    short-term debt balances peak by the end of January and then
    start to decline, as customers begin to pay their winter heating
    bills. Gas stored underground, particularly in our natural gas
    distribution segment, typically peaks in November and declines
    as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers.

During the current year, several external factors have impacted
    Atmos Energy, including, but not limited to, adverse
    developments in the global and financial credit markets and the
    unfavorable impact of the economic recession.

The tightening of the credit markets has made it more difficult
    and more expensive for us to access the capital markets.
    However, during the fiscal year, we took several steps to
    improve our financial position. In March 2009, we successfully
    completed an offering of $450 million 8.5% senior
    notes, and used most of the proceeds in April 2009 to redeem
    $400 million of senior notes that were scheduled to mature
    in October 2009. Additionally, we enhanced our liquidity sources
    in various ways. In October 2008, we replaced our former
    $300 million

364-day

committed credit facility with a new

364-day

$212.5 million committed credit facility. Then, in October
    2009, we replaced the $212.5 million

364-day

committed credit facility with a new

364-day

$200 million committed credit facility. We also converted
    AEM’s former $580 million uncommitted credit



facility to a

364-day

$375 million committed credit facility in December 2008.
    This facility was subsequently increased to $450 million in
    April 2009. Finally, in April 2009 we replaced an expiring
    $18 million unsecured committed credit facility with a
    $25 million unsecured committed credit facility. After
    entering into these new facilities, we currently have a total of
    approximately $902.0 million available to us under four
    committed credit facilities. As a result of these developments
    and our continued successful financial performance,
    Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P) upgraded
    our credit rating from BBB to BBB+ in December 2008 and
    Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) upgraded the
    credit rating on our senior long-term debt from Baa3 to Baa2 and
    our commercial paper from

P-3

to

P-2

in May
    2009. These ratings upgrades have improved our ability to access
    the short-term capital markets to satisfy our liquidity
    requirements on more economical terms.

However, the turmoil in the financial markets did also have a
    direct financial impact on our results of operations. We
    determined that the decline in fair value for certain

available-for-sale

securities in our Supplemental Executive Benefit Plans
    experienced during the year ended September 30, 2009 was
    other than temporary and, accordingly, recorded a
    $5.4 million noncash charge to impair the assets. As a
    result of these impairments, we do not maintain any investments
    that are in an unrealized loss position.

Finally, challenging economic times resulted in a general
    decline in throughput across most of our business segments. The
    impact of the economic downturn is most apparent in a general
    decline in throughput. Our natural gas distribution segment has
    experienced a

year-over-year

5 percent decrease in consolidated throughput, primarily
    associated with lower residential, commercial and industrial
    consumption. Declines in the demand for natural gas as a result
    of idle production and plant closures have contributed to an
    11 percent

year-over-year

decrease in consolidated throughput in our regulated
    transmission and storage segment and a 5 percent

year-over-year

decrease in consolidated sales volumes in our natural gas
    marketing segment. However, recent improvements in rate design
    in our natural gas distribution segment and the ability to earn
    higher

per-unit

margins in our regulated transmission and storage and natural
    gas marketing segments has more than offset the decline in
    throughput and sales volumes. Additionally, reduced demand for
    natural gas has resulted in lower natural gas prices, which has
    contributed significantly to the increase in our operating cash
    flow.

Net income during fiscal 2009 increased six percent over fiscal
    2008. Net income from our regulated operations increased
    18 percent during fiscal 2009. The increase primarily
    reflects a $32.3 million increase in gross profit resulting
    from the net favorable impact of various ratemaking activities
    in our natural gas distribution segment, partially offset by
    higher depreciation expense, pipeline maintenance costs and
    interest expense. Net income in our nonregulated operations
    decreased $13.1 million, primarily due to the impact of
    unrealized margins. Unrealized margins totaled
    $35.9 million which reduced earnings per share by $0.23 per
    diluted share. The overall increase in consolidated net income
    was also favorably affected by non-recurring items totaling
    $17.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, related to the
    following pre-tax amounts:

•

$11.3 million related to a favorable one-time tax benefit

•

$7.6 million related to the favorable impact of an update
    to the estimate for unbilled accounts

•

$7.0 million favorable impact of the reversal of estimated
    uncollectible gas costs

•

$5.4 million unfavorable impact of a non-cash impairment
    charge of $5.4 million related to

available-for-sale

securities in our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan

Net income during fiscal 2008 increased seven percent over
    fiscal 2007. Net income from our regulated operations increased
    24 percent during fiscal 2008. The increase primarily
    reflects a $53.8 million increase in gross profit resulting
    from our ratemaking efforts, coupled with higher

per-unit

transportation margins and an 18 percent increase in
    consolidated throughput in our Atmos Pipeline — Texas
    Division. These increases were partially offset by a four
    percent increase in operating expenses. Net income in our
    nonregulated operations experienced a 24 percent decline as
    less volatile natural gas market conditions significantly
    reduced our asset optimization margins. However, higher
    delivered gas margins in our natural gas marketing segment and
    unrealized margins partially offset this decrease.

See the following discussion regarding the results of operations
    for each of our business operating segments.



Natural
    Gas Distribution Segment

The primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas
    distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized
    rates of return, the cost of natural gas, competitive factors in
    the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas.

Our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on
    our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking
    jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and,
    ultimately, separating the recovery of our approved margins from
    customer usage patterns. Improving rate design is a long-term
    process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate
    in multiple rate jurisdictions. The “Ratemaking
    Activity” section of this

Form 10-K

describes our current rate strategy and recent ratemaking
    initiatives in more detail.

Our natural gas distribution operations are also affected by the
    cost of natural gas. The cost of gas is passed through to our
    customers without markup. Therefore, increases in the cost of
    gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues.
    Accordingly, we believe gross profit is a better indicator of
    our financial performance than revenues. However, gross profit
    in our Texas and Mississippi service areas include franchise
    fees and gross receipts taxes, which are calculated as a
    percentage of revenue (inclusive of gas costs). Therefore, the
    amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the
    cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes. We record the
    tax expense as a component of taxes, other than income. Although
    changes in revenue-related taxes arising from changes in gas
    costs affect gross profit, over time the impact is offset within
    operating income. Prior to January 1, 2009, timing
    differences existed between the recognition of revenue for
    franchise fees collected from our customers and the recognition
    of expense of franchise taxes. These timing differences had a
    significant temporary effect on operating income in periods with
    volatile gas prices, particularly in our Mid-Tex Division.
    Beginning January 1, 2009, changes in our franchise fee
    agreements in our Mid-Tex Division became effective which should
    significantly reduce the impact of this timing difference on a
    prospective basis. Although this timing difference will still be
    present for gross receipts taxes, the timing differences
    described above should be less significant.

Higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts
    receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense,
    and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit
    facilities resulting in higher interest expense. Finally, higher
    gas costs, as well as competitive factors in the industry and
    general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or
    use alternative energy sources.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2008

The $18.6 million increase in natural gas distribution
    gross profit primarily reflects an increase in rates. The major
    components of the increase are as follows:

•

$13.6 million net increase in rates in the Mid-Tex Division
    as a result of the implementation of its 2008 Rate Review
    Mechanism (RRM) filing with all incorporated cities in the
    division other than the City of Dallas and Environs (the Settled
    Cities) and adjustments for customers in the City of Dallas.

•

$16.0 million increase in other rate adjustments primarily
    in Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana and West Texas.

•

$7.6 million increase attributable to a non-recurring
    update to our estimate for gas delivered to customers but not
    yet billed to reflect changes in base rates in several of our
    jurisdictions recorded in the fiscal first quarter.

•

$7.0 million uncollectible gas cost accrual recorded in a
    prior year that was reversed in the current year period.

These increases were partially offset by:

•

$17.9 million decrease as a result of a five percent
    decrease in consolidated distribution throughput primarily
    associated with lower residential, commercial and industrial
    consumption and warmer weather in our Colorado service area,
    which does not have weather-normalized rates.

•

$10.8 million decrease due to lower revenue related taxes,
    partially offset by the associated franchise and state gross
    receipts tax expense recorded as a component of taxes other than
    income discussed below.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
    expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
    amortization expense, taxes, other than income and asset
    impairments decreased $9.3 million, primarily due to the
    following:

•

$10.6 million decrease due to lower legal, fuel and other
    administrative costs.

•

$9.2 million decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts
    due to the impact of recent rate design changes in certain
    jurisdictions that allow us to recover the gas cost portion of
    uncollectible accounts as well as a 23 percent

year-over-year

decline in the average cost of gas.

•

$9.2 million decrease in taxes other than income primarily
    associated with lower franchise fees and state gross receipt
    taxes.

These decreases were partially offset by:

•

$15.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization,
    due primarily to additional assets placed in service during the
    current year.

•

$4.6 million increase due to a noncash charge to impair
    certain

available-for-sale

investments as we believed the fair value of these investments
    would not recover within a reasonable period of time.

Results for the current year include a $10.5 million tax
    benefit associated with updating the rates used to determine our
    deferred taxes. In addition, results for the prior year included
    a $1.2 million gain on the sale of irrigation assets in our
    West Texas Division.

Interest charges increased $6.1 million primarily due to
    the effect of the Company’s March 2009 issuance of
    $450 million 8.50% senior notes to repay
    $400 million 4.00% senior notes in April 2009. In
    addition, we experienced higher average short-term debt
    balances, interest rates and commitment fees during the current
    year compared to the prior year.



Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2008 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2007

The $53.4 million increase in natural gas distribution
    gross profit is primarily the result of increased rates and
    higher revenue-related taxes. The major components of the
    increase are as follows:

•

$29.2 million increase in rates in the Mid-Tex Division due
    to its 2006 GRIP filing, the fiscal 2008 and 2007 rate cases and
    the absence of a one time GRIP refund that occurred in fiscal
    2007.

•

$14.4 million increase in rates in the Kansas, Kentucky,
    Louisiana, Tennessee and West Texas divisions.

•

$8.6 million increase due to higher revenue related taxes,
    partially offset by the associated franchise and state gross
    receipts tax expense recorded as a component of taxes other than
    income discussed below.

•

$7.5 million increase due to an accrual for estimated
    unrecoverable gas costs in fiscal 2007 that did not recur in
    fiscal 2008.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
    expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
    amortization expense and taxes, other than income, increased by
    a net $13.4 million, primarily due to the following:

•

$9.0 million increase primarily due to higher employee and
    administrative costs and increased natural gas odorization and
    fuel costs.

•

$7.2 increase in franchise and state gross receipts taxes due to
    higher revenues.

•

$4.3 million increase due to the absence in the current
    year of the deferral of hurricane-related operation and
    maintenance expenses in fiscal 2007.

•

$3.3 million noncash charge associated with the write-off
    of software costs in fiscal 2007 that did not recur in fiscal
    2008.

These increases were offset by a $3.2 million decrease in
    the provision for doubtful accounts, which reflects our
    continued effective collection efforts.

The increase in miscellaneous income primarily reflects the
    recognition of a $1.2 million gain on the sale of
    irrigation assets in our West Texas Division during the fiscal
    2008 second quarter.

Interest charges allocated to the natural gas distribution
    segment decreased $3.7 million due to lower average
    outstanding short-term debt balances in fiscal 2008 compared
    with fiscal 2007.

Regulated
    Transmission and Storage Segment

Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the
    regulated pipeline and storage operations of the Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division. The Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division transports natural gas to
    our Mid-Tex Division and third parties and manages five
    underground storage reservoirs in Texas. We also provide
    ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including
    parking arrangements, lending and sales of inventory on hand.

Similar to our natural gas distribution segment, our regulated
    transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather
    patterns, competitive factors in the energy industry and
    economic conditions in our service areas. Natural gas prices do
    not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are
    derived from the transportation of natural gas. However, natural
    gas prices could influence the level of drilling activity in the
    markets that we serve, which may influence the level of
    throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline.
    Additionally, pricing differences that occur between the natural
    gas hubs served by our pipeline could significantly impact our
    results as we can profit through the arbitrage of these spreads.
    Spread differences are influenced by supply and demand
    constraints not only in the markets we directly serve but in
    other markets as well. Further, as the Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division operations supply all of the
    natural gas for our Mid-Tex Division, the results of this
    segment are highly dependent upon the natural gas requirements
    of the Mid-Tex Division. Finally, as a regulated pipeline, the
    operations of the Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division may
    be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are
    incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through
    its tariffs.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2008

The $13.7 million increase in regulated transmission and
    storage gross profit was attributable primarily to the following
    factors:

•

$13.0 million increase from higher demand-based fees.

•

$5.6 million increase resulting from higher transportation
    fees on through-system deliveries due to market conditions.

•

$5.4 million increase due to our GRIP filings.

These increases were partially offset by an $8.4 million
    decrease associated with a decrease in transportation volumes to
    our Mid-Tex Division due to warmer weather and a decrease in
    electrical generation, Barnett Shale and HUB deliveries.

Operating expenses increased $10.3 million primarily due to
    higher levels of pipeline maintenance activities.

Results for the current-year period also include a
    $1.7 million tax benefit associated with updating the rates
    used to determine our deferred taxes.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2008 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2007

The $32.7 million increase in regulated transmission and
    storage gross profit is primarily the result of rate adjustments
    and increased volumes. The major components of the increase are
    as follows:

•

$13.1 million increase from rate adjustments resulting from
    our 2006 and 2007 GRIP filings.

•

$8.3 million increase from transportation volumes as
    consolidated throughput increased 18 percent primarily due
    to increased transportation in the Barnett Shale region of Texas.



•

$8.0 million increase related to increased service fees and

per-unit

transportation margins due to favorable market conditions.

•

$1.5 million increase due to new compression contracts and
    transportation capacity enhancements.

•

$1.3 million increase in sales of excess gas compared to
    2007.

Operating expenses increased $22.8 million primarily due to
    increased pipeline integrity and maintenance costs.

Natural
    Gas Marketing Segment

AEM’s primary business is to aggregate and purchase gas
    supply, arrange transportation and storage logistics and
    ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices. In
    addition, AEM utilizes proprietary and customer-owned
    transportation and storage assets to provide various services
    our customers request, including furnishing natural gas supplies
    at fixed and market-based prices, contract negotiation and
    administration, load forecasting, gas storage acquisition and
    management services, transportation services, peaking sales and
    balancing services, capacity utilization strategies and gas
    price hedging through the use of financial instruments. As a
    result, AEM’s margins arise from the types of commercial
    transactions we have structured with our customers and our
    ability to identify the lowest cost alternative among the
    natural gas supplies, transportation and markets to which it has
    access to serve those customers.

AEM seeks to enhance its gross profit margin by maximizing,
    through asset optimization activities, the economic value
    associated with the storage and transportation capacity we own
    or control in our natural gas distribution and natural gas
    marketing segments. We attempt to meet this objective by
    engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to
    find and profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in
    various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that
    occur over time. This process involves purchasing physical
    natural gas, storing it in the storage and transportation assets
    to which AEM has access and selling financial instruments at
    advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit margin.

AEM continually manages its net physical position to attempt to
    increase the future economic profit that was created when the
    original transaction was executed. Therefore, AEM may
    subsequently change its originally scheduled storage injection
    and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on
    market conditions and recognize any associated gains or losses
    at that time. If AEM elects to accelerate the withdrawal of
    physical gas, it will execute new financial instruments to hedge
    the original financial instruments. If AEM elects to defer the
    withdrawal of gas, it will reset its financial instruments by
    settling the original financial instruments and executing new
    financial instruments to correspond to the revised withdrawal
    schedule.

We use financial instruments, designated as fair value hedges,
    to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our natural gas
    marketing storage activities. These financial instruments are
    marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with
    changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses
    in the period of change. The hedged natural gas inventory is
    marked to market at the end of each month based on the Gas Daily
    index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains
    and losses in the period of change. Changes in the spreads
    between the forward natural gas prices used to value the
    financial hedges designated against our physical inventory and
    the market (spot) prices used to value our physical storage
    result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas
    is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled.
    Once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are
    settled, the previously unrealized margins associated with these
    net positions are realized.

AEM also uses financial instruments to capture additional
    storage arbitrage opportunities that may arise after the
    original physical inventory hedge and to attempt to insulate and
    protect the economic value within its asset optimization
    activities. Changes in fair value associated with these
    financial instruments are recognized as a component of
    unrealized margins until they are settled.

Due to the nature of these operations, natural gas prices have a
    significant impact on our natural gas marketing operations.
    Within our delivered gas activities, higher natural gas prices
    may adversely impact our



accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt
    expense, and may require us to increase borrowings under our
    credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. Higher
    gas prices, as well as competitive factors in the industry and
    general economic conditions may also cause customers to conserve
    or use alternative energy sources. Within our asset optimization
    activities, higher gas prices could also lead to increased
    borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher
    interest expense.

Volatility in natural gas prices also has a significant impact
    on our natural gas marketing segment. Increased price volatility
    often has a significant impact on the spreads between the market
    (spot) prices and forward natural gas prices, which creates
    opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads within our asset
    optimization activities. However, increased volatility impacts
    the amounts of unrealized margins recorded in our gross profit
    and could impact the amount of cash required to collateralize
    our risk management liabilities.

Review of
    Financial and Operating Results

Financial and operational highlights for our natural gas
    marketing segment for the fiscal years ended September 30,
    2009, 2008 and 2007 are presented below. Gross profit margin
    consists primarily of margins earned from the delivery of gas
    and related services requested by our customers and margins
    earned from asset optimization activities, which are derived
    from the utilization of our proprietary and managed third party
    storage and transportation assets to capture favorable arbitrage
    spreads through natural gas trading activities.

Unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses on
    our net physical position and the related financial instruments
    used to manage commodity price risk as described above. These
    margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the
    physical and forward natural gas prices. Generally, if the
    physical/financial spread narrows, we will record unrealized
    gains or lower unrealized losses. If the physical/financial
    spread widens, we will record unrealized losses or lower
    unrealized gains. The magnitude of the unrealized gains and
    losses is also dependent upon the levels of our net physical
    position at the end of the reporting period.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2008

AEM’s delivered gas business contributed 67 percent to
    total realized margins during fiscal 2009 with asset
    optimization activities contributing the remaining
    33 percent. In the prior year, delivered gas activities
    represented substantially all of AEM’s realized gross
    profit margin. The $45.5 million increase in realized gross
    profit reflected:

•

A $43.8 million increase in asset optimization margins. AEM
    realized substantially all of its realized asset optimization
    margin in the fiscal 2009 first quarter when it realized
    substantially all of the economic value that it had captured as
    of September 30, 2008 from withdrawing gas and settling the
    associated financial instruments. Since that time, as a result
    of falling current cash prices, AEM has been deferring storage
    withdrawals and has been a net injector of gas into storage to
    increase the economic value it could realize in future periods
    from its asset optimization activities. In the prior year, AEM
    deferred storage withdrawals primarily into fiscal 2009 and
    recognized losses on the settlement of the associated financial
    instruments.

•

A $1.7 million increase in realized delivered gas margins.
    AEM experienced a six percent increase in

per-unit

margins as a result of improved basis spreads in certain market
    areas where we were able to better optimize transportation
    assets and successful contract renewals. These margin
    improvements more than offset a four percent decrease in gross
    sales volumes primarily attributable to lower industrial demand
    as a result of the current economic climate.

The increase in realized gross profit was more than offset by a
    $53.9 million decrease in unrealized margins attributable
    to the following:

•

The realization of unrealized gains recorded during fiscal 2008.

•

A modest widening of the physical/financial spreads, partially
    offset by favorable unrealized basis gains in certain markets.

•

A 5.8 Bcf increase in AEM’s net physical position.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
    expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
    amortization expense, taxes, other than income taxes, and asset
    impairments, increased $1.6 million primarily due the
    following factors:

•

$4.0 million increase in legal and other administrative
    costs.

•

$2.4 million decrease related to tax matters incurred in
    the prior year that did not recur in the current year.

Asset
    Optimization Activities

AEM monitors the impact of its asset optimization efforts by
    estimating the gross profit, before related fees, that it
    captured through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas
    and the execution of the associated financial instruments. This
    economic value, combined with the effect of the future reversal
    of unrealized gains or losses currently recognized in the income
    statement and related fees is referred to as the potential gross
    profit.

We define potential gross profit as the change in AEM’s
    gross profit in future periods if its optimization efforts are
    executed as planned. This amount does not include other
    operating expenses and associated income taxes that will be
    incurred to realize this amount. Therefore, it does not
    represent an estimated increase in future net income. There is
    no assurance that the economic value or the potential gross
    profit will be fully realized in the future.

We consider this measure a non-GAAP financial measure as it is
    calculated using both forward-looking storage
    injection/withdrawal and hedge settlement estimates and
    historical financial information. This measure is presented
    because we believe it provides a more comprehensive view to
    investors of our asset optimization efforts and thus a better
    understanding of these activities than would be presented by
    GAAP measures alone.



The following table presents AEM’s economic value and its
    potential gross profit (loss) at September 30, 2009 and
    2008.

Related fees represent AEM’s contractual costs to acquire
    the storage capacity utilized in its asset optimization
    operations. The fees primarily consist of demand fees and
    contractual obligations to sell gas below market index prices in
    exchange for the right to manage and optimize third party
    storage assets for the positions AEM has entered into as of
    September 30, 2009 and 2008.

During the year ended September 30, 2009, AEM’s
    economic value decreased from $48.5 million, or $6.08/Mcf
    at September 30, 2008, to $28.6 million, or $2.07/Mcf.
    As discussed above, in the fiscal 2009 first quarter, AEM
    withdrew gas and realized substantially all of the economic
    value that it captured as of September 30, 2008. During the
    remainder of the year, as a result of falling current cash
    prices, AEM deferred certain storage withdrawals and has been a
    net injector of gas into storage to increase economic value that
    it can realize in future periods.

The economic value is based upon planned storage injection and
    withdrawal schedules and its realization is contingent upon the
    execution of this plan, weather and other execution factors.
    Since AEM actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to
    attempt to enhance the future profitability of its storage
    position, it may change its scheduled storage injection and
    withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market
    conditions. Therefore, we cannot ensure that the economic value
    or the potential gross profit calculated as of
    September 30, 2009 will be fully realized in the future nor
    can we ensure in what time periods such realization may occur.
    Further, if we experience operational or other issues which
    limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions,
    our earnings could be adversely impacted. Assuming AEM fully
    executes its plan in place on September 30, 2009, without
    encountering operational or other issues, we anticipate the
    majority of the potential gross profit as of September 30,
    2009 will be recognized during the first and second quarters of
    fiscal 2010.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2008 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2007

AEM’s delivered gas business represented substantially all
    of AEM’s realized gross profit margin in fiscal 2008. In
    fiscal 2007, AEM’s delivered gas business contributed
    66 percent to total realized margins during the year with
    asset optimization activities contributing the remaining
    34 percent. The $18.4 million decrease in realized
    gross profit reflected:

•

A $35.0 million decrease in realized asset optimization
    margins. As a result of less volatile natural gas market
    conditions experienced during fiscal 2008, AEM regularly
    deferred storage withdrawals and reset the associated financial
    instruments to increase the future economic value it could
    realize in future periods from its asset optimization
    activities. AEM recognized losses on the settlement of the
    associated financial instruments without corresponding storage
    withdrawal gains. In fiscal 2007, AEM changed its withdrawal
    schedule within the fiscal year and recognized substantially
    smaller losses from resetting its position. Increased storage
    fees during fiscal 2008 also contributed to the decrease.

•

A $16.6 million increase in realized delivered gas margins.
    Gross sales volumes increased eight percent due to the
    successful execution of our marketing strategies. Basis gains
    and contract renewals increased



per-unit

margins 19 percent. Excluding the impact of basis gains,

per-unit

margins increased seven percent in fiscal 2008.

The decrease in realized gross profit was partially offset by a
    $7.1 million increase in unrealized margins attributable to:

•

A narrowing of the spreads between current cash prices and
    forward natural gas prices. This impact was partially mitigated
    by a 4.3 Bcf decrease in the net physical position.

•

The realization of unrealized gains recorded during fiscal 2007.

Operating expenses increased $7.4 million primarily due to
    the following:

•

$5.0 million increase in other administrative costs.

•

$2.4 million increase associated with property taxes.

Pipeline,
    Storage and Other Segment

Our pipeline, storage and other segment consists primarily of
    the operations of Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC (APS). APS is
    engaged in nonregulated transmission, storage and natural
    gas-gathering services. Its primary asset is a proprietary
    21 mile pipeline located in New Orleans, Louisiana that is
    primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural
    gas distribution division in Louisiana and for our natural gas
    marketing segment, and, on a more limited basis, to third
    parties. APS also owns or has an interest in underground storage
    fields in Kentucky and Louisiana that are used to reduce the
    need of our natural gas distribution divisions to contract for
    additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak
    periods.

APS also engages in asset optimization activities whereby it
    seeks to maximize the economic value associated with the storage
    and transportation capacity it owns or controls. Certain of
    these arrangements are with regulated affiliates of the Company
    which have been approved by applicable state regulatory
    commissions. Generally, these asset management plans require APS
    to share with our regulated customers a portion of the profits
    earned from these arrangements. APS also seeks to maximize the
    economic value associated with the storage and transportation
    capacity it owns or controls by engaging in natural gas storage
    transactions in which we seek to find and profit from the
    pricing differences that occur over time.

Results for this segment are primarily impacted by seasonal
    weather patterns and, similar to our natural gas marketing
    segment, volatility in the natural gas markets. Additionally,
    this segment’s results include an unrealized component as
    APS hedges its risk associated with its asset optimization
    activities.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2008

Gross profit from our pipeline, storage and other segment
    increased $1.2 million primarily due to the following:

•

$16.3 million increase in asset optimization margins as a
    result of larger realized gains from the settlement of financial
    positions associated with storage and trading activities, basis
    gains earned from utilizing controlled pipeline capacity and
    higher margins earned under asset management plans.

•

$12.2 million decrease in unrealized margins associated
    with our asset optimization activities due to a widening of the
    spreads between current cash prices and forward natural gas
    prices.

Operating expenses increased $3.0 million primarily due to
    increased employee costs and higher depreciation expense which
    was largely attributable to additional assets placed in service
    during the year.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2008 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2007

Gross profit from our pipeline, storage and other segment
    decreased $4.3 million primarily due to the following
    factors:

•

$6.9 million decrease in asset optimization margins as a
    result of a less volatile natural gas market.

•

$2.6 million increase in unrealized margins associated with
    asset optimization activities.

Operating expenses decreased $2.3 million primarily due to
    the absence in fiscal 2008 of a $3.0 million noncash charge
    recorded in fiscal 2007 related to the write-off of costs
    associated with a natural gas gathering project.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital
    expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of
    sources including internally generated funds and borrowings
    under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities.
    Additionally, we have various uncommitted trade credit lines
    with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas
    on a monthly basis without using our credit facilities. Finally,
    from time to time, we raise funds from the public debt and
    equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs.



The primary means we use to fund our working capital needs and
    growth is to utilize internally generated funds and to access
    the commercial paper markets. Adverse developments in global
    financial and credit markets during the first fiscal quarter of
    2009 made it more difficult and more expensive for the Company
    to access the short-term capital markets, including the
    commercial paper market, to satisfy our liquidity requirements.
    Consequently, during the first quarter, we experienced higher
    than normal borrowings under our five-year credit facility used
    to backstop our commercial paper program in lieu of commercial
    paper borrowings to fund our working capital needs. However,
    subsequent to the end of the first quarter, credit market
    conditions improved, both as to availability and interest rates,
    and we have been able to access the commercial paper markets on
    more reasonably economical terms. Further, as a result of our
    financing activities described below, we received credit rating
    upgrades from two of the three credit rating agencies, which has
    reduced the cost of our commercial paper borrowings. At
    September 30, 2009, we had commercial paper outstanding of
    $72.6 million under this facility and $494.1 million
    was available.

On March 26, 2009, we closed our offering of
    $450 million of 8.50% senior notes due 2019. Most of
    the net proceeds of approximately $446 million were used to
    redeem our $400 million 4.00% unsecured senior notes on
    April 30, 2009, prior to their October 2009 maturity. In
    connection with the repayment of the $400 million 4.00%
    unsecured senior notes, we paid a $6.6 million call premium
    in accordance with the terms of the senior notes and accrued
    interest of approximately $0.6 million. The remaining net
    proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

In October 2009, we replaced our former $212.5 million

364-day

committed credit facility that was entered into in October 2008
    with a new

364-day

credit facility on similar terms that will allow borrowings up
    to $200.0 million and expires in October 2010.

In December 2008, we converted AEM’s former
    $580 million uncommitted credit facility to a
    $375 million committed credit facility that will expire in
    December 2009. Effective April 1, 2009, we exercised the
    accordion feature of this facility to increase the credit
    available under the facility to $450 million. We are
    currently negotiating to renew this facility. In addition, we
    replaced our $18 million unsecured committed credit
    facility that expired in March 2009 with a $25 million
    unsecured facility effective April 1, 2009. As a result of
    executing these new agreements, we have a total of approximately
    $1.3 billion available to us under four committed credit
    facilities. As of September 30, 2009, the amount available
    to us under our credit facilities, net of outstanding letters of
    credit, was approximately $902 million.

We believe the liquidity provided by our committed credit
    facilities, combined with our operating cash flows, will be
    sufficient to fund our working capital needs, capital
    expenditures and other expenditures for fiscal year 2010.

Cash
    Flows

Our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a
    number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These
    include regulatory changes, the price for our services, the
    demand for such products and services, margin requirements
    resulting from significant changes in commodity prices,
    operational risks and other factors.

Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities
    for the years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are

Cash
    flows from operating activities

Year-over-year

changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable
    to changes in net income, working capital changes, particularly
    within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the
    price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections,
    payments for natural gas purchases and purchased gas cost
    recoveries. The significant factors impacting our operating cash
    flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below.

Fiscal
    Year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2008

Operating cash flows were $548.3 million higher in fiscal
    2009 compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following:

•

$368.9 million increase attributable to the favorable
    impact on our working capital due to the decline in natural gas
    prices in the current year compared to the prior year.

•

$56.8 million increase due to lower cash margin
    requirements related to our natural gas marketing financial
    instruments.

•

These increases were partially offset by a $21.0 million
    decrease due to a contribution made to our pension plans in the
    current year.

Fiscal
    Year ended September 30, 2008 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2007

Operating cash flows were $176.2 million lower in fiscal
    2008 compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to the following:

•

$95.7 million decrease due to higher cash margin
    requirements related to our natural gas marketing financial
    instruments.

•

$92.6 million decrease due to the unfavorable timing of gas
    cost collections in our natural gas distribution segment.

Cash
    flows from investing activities

In recent fiscal years, a substantial portion of our cash
    resources has been used to fund acquisitions and growth
    projects, our ongoing construction program and improvements to
    information technology systems. Our ongoing construction program
    enables us to provide natural gas distribution services to our
    existing customer base, expand our natural gas distribution
    services into new markets, enhance the integrity of our
    pipelines and, more recently, expand our intrastate pipeline
    network. In executing our current rate strategy, we are focusing
    our capital spending in jurisdictions that permit us to earn an
    adequate return timely on our investment without compromising
    the safety or reliability of our system. Currently, our Mid-Tex,
    Louisiana, Mississippi and West Texas natural gas distribution
    divisions and our Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division have
    rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their
    rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without
    being required to file a rate case.

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, we incurred
    $509.5 million for capital expenditures compared with
    $472.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30,
    2008 and $392.4 million for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2007.

The increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 compared to
    fiscal 2008 primarily reflects $32.6 million related to
    spending for a regulated transmission pipeline project completed
    in the fourth quarter of 2009.

The increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 compared to
    fiscal 2007 primarily reflects the following:

•

$50.3 million increase in compliance spending and main
    replacements in our Mid-Tex Division.

•

$12.8 million increase in the natural gas distribution
    segment for our new automated meter reading initiative.

•

$4.7 million increase related to spending for two
    nonregulated growth projects.



Cash
    flows from financing activities

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, our financing
    activities used $337.5 million in cash, while financing
    activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008
    provided $98.1 million in cash compared with cash of
    $159.3 million used for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2007. Our significant financing activities
    for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and
    2007 are summarized as follows:

    unsecured notes.

•

Repaid a net $284.0 million of short-term borrowings under
    our credit facilities.

•

•

Received $445.6 million in net proceeds related to the
    March 2009 issuance of $450 million of 8.50% Senior

    8.50% Senior Notes due 2019.


During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, we:

•

Borrowed a net $200.2 million under our short-term
    facilities due to the impact of seasonal natural gas purchases
    and the effect of higher natural gas prices.

•

Repaid $10.3 million of long-term debt in accordance with
    their normal maturity schedules.

•

Received $25.5 million in net proceeds related to the
    issuance of 1.0 million shares of common stock.

    due 2017. We used the net proceeds of $247 million,
    together with $53 million of available cash, to repay our
    $300 million unsecured floating rate senior notes, which
    were redeemed on July 15, 2007.

•

Paid $111.7 million in dividends, which reflected a payout
    ratio of 67 percent of net income.

•

Received $24.9 million related to the issuance of common
    stock under various plans.

Credit
    Facilities

As of September 30, 2009, we had three committed credit
    facilities in our regulated operations totaling
    $804.2 million. These facilities included (1) a
    five-year $566.7 million unsecured facility expiring
    December 2011, (2) a $212.5 million unsecured facility
    expiring October 2009, and (3) a $25 million unsecured
    facility expiring March 31, 2010. At the time the
    $566.7 million credit facility was established, borrowings
    under the facility were limited to $600 million. However,
    in March 2009, the facility was amended to reduce the amount
    available to $566.7 million to reflect the bankruptcy of
    one lender that participated in the facility. In October 2009,
    we replaced our $212.5 million facility at its termination
    with a new $200 million unsecured

364-day

facility. After giving effect to these changes, the amount
    available to us under our committed credit facilities was
    $791.7 million. As of September 30, 2009, we had no
    outstanding letters of credit under these facilities.

AEM has a committed credit facility that can provide up to
    $450 million to support its nonregulated activities,
    primarily the issuance of letters of credit to natural gas
    suppliers. As of September 30, 2009, the amount available
    to us under this credit facility, net of outstanding letters of
    credit, was $170.4 million. Our credit capacity and the
    amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal
    nature of the natural gas business and our short-term borrowing
    requirements, which are typically highest during colder winter
    months.

Our working capital needs can vary significantly due to changes
    in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the
    increased gas supplies required to meet customers’ needs
    during periods of cold weather. However, we believe these credit
    facilities, combined with our operating cash flows will be
    sufficient to fund our working capital needs, our fiscal 2010
    capital expenditure program and our common stock dividends.
    These facilities are described in further detail in Note 6
    to the consolidated financial statements.

Shelf
    Registration

On March 23, 2009, we filed a registration statement with
    the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue, from time
    to time, up to $900 million in common stock

and/or

debt
    securities available for issuance, including approximately
    $450 million of capacity carried over from our prior shelf
    registration statement filed with the SEC in December 2006.
    Immediately following the filing of the registration statement,
    we issued $450 million of 8.50% senior notes due 2019
    under the registration statement. Most of the net proceeds of
    approximately $446 million were used to repay our
    $400 million unsecured 4.00% senior notes on
    April 30, 2009. As of September 30, 2009, we had
    $450 million of availability remaining under the
    registration statement. However, due to certain restrictions
    placed by one state regulatory commission on our ability to
    issue securities under the registration statement, we now have
    remaining and available for issuance a total of approximately
    $200 million of equity securities and $250 million of
    debt securities.



Credit
    Ratings

Our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain
    short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the cost of
    such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating
    agencies consider a number of quantitative factors, including
    debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to
    outstanding debt, operating cash flow coverage of interest and
    pension liabilities and funding status. In addition, the rating
    agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our
    earnings over time, the quality of our management and business
    strategy, the risks associated with our regulated and
    nonregulated businesses and the regulatory structures that
    govern our rates in the states where we operate.

Our debt is rated by three rating agencies: Standard &
    Poor’s Corporation (S&P), Moody’s Investors
    Services, Inc. (Moody’s) and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (Fitch).
    In December 2008, S&P upgraded our senior long-term debt
    credit rating from BBB to BBB+ and changed our rating outlook
    from positive to stable. S&P cited improved financial
    performance and rate case decisions that have increased cash
    flow as the key drivers for the upgrade. In May 2009,
    Moody’s upgraded the credit rating on our senior long-term
    debt from Baa3 to Baa2 and on our commercial paper from

P-3

to

P-2.

Moody’s stated that the key drivers for the upgrade were
    the completion of a major debt refinancing and the Company
    improving its alternate liquidity resources while maintaining
    solid financial performance. As of September 30, 2009, all
    three rating agencies maintained a stable outlook. None of our
    ratings are currently under review. Our current debt ratings are
    all considered investment grade and are as follows:

S&P

Moody’s

Fitch

Unsecured senior long-term debt

BBB+

Baa2

BBB+

Commercial paper

A-2

P-2

F-2

A significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited
    access to the private and public credit markets as a result of
    the recent adverse global financial and credit conditions could
    trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a
    reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating
    agencies. This would mean more limited access to the private and
    public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such
    borrowings.

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
    securities. The highest investment grade credit rating for
    S&P is AAA, Moody’s is Aaa and Fitch is AAA. The
    lowest investment grade credit rating for S&P is BBB-,
    Moody’s is Baa3 and Fitch is BBB-. Our credit ratings may
    be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies, and
    each rating should be evaluated independent of any other rating.
    There can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect
    for any given period of time or that a rating will not be
    lowered, or withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its
    judgment, circumstances so warrant.

Debt
    Covenants

We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of
    September 30, 2009. Our debt covenants are described in
    Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, including
    short-term debt, was 50.7 percent and 54.6 percent at
    September 30, 2009 and 2008. The decrease in the debt to
    capitalization ratio primarily reflects a decrease in short-term
    debt as of September 30, 2009 compared to the prior year.
    Our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater
    during the winter heating season as we make additional
    short-term borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our
    working capital requirements. We consider our optimal
    capitalization ratio to be in the range of 50 to 55 percent
    and seek to maintain this range through cash flow generated from
    operations, continued issuance of new common stock under our
    Direct Stock Purchase Plan and Retirement Savings Plan and
    access to the equity capital markets.

AEM has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural
    gas under contracts indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed
    price contracts. At September 30, 2009, AEM was committed
    to purchase 72.6 Bcf within one year, 19.4 Bcf within
    one to three years and 2.2 Bcf after three years under
    indexed contracts. AEM was committed to purchase 2.9 Bcf
    within one year under fixed price contracts with prices ranging
    from $2.95 to $7.68 per Mcf.

With the exception of our Mid-Tex Division, our natural gas
    distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several
    vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year.
    Commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under
    these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated
    prices. Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as
    necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the
    individual contract. Our Mid-Tex Division maintains long-term
    supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our
    customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase
    specified volumes at market prices. The estimated commitments
    under these contract terms as of September 30, 2009 are
    reflected in the table above.

Risk
    Management Activities

We use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk
    and, periodically, to manage interest rate risk. We conduct risk
    management activities through our natural gas distribution,
    natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments.
    In our natural gas distribution segment, we use a combination of
    physical storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed financial
    contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large
    winter-period gas price increases. In our natural gas marketing
    and pipeline, storage and other segments, we manage our exposure
    to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross
    profit margin through a combination of storage and financial
    instruments, including futures,

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with
    counterparties. To the extent our inventory cost and actual
    sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in
    the market indices we use in our hedges, we could experience
    ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting
    requirements for hedge accounting, resulting in the financial
    instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through
    earnings.

We use financial instruments, designated as cash flow hedges of
    anticipated purchases and sales at index prices, to mitigate the
    commodity price risk in our natural gas marketing segment
    associated with deliveries under fixed-priced forward contracts
    to deliver gas to customers, and we use financial instruments,
    designated as fair value hedges, to hedge our natural gas
    inventory used in our asset optimization activities in our
    natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments.

Also, in our natural gas marketing segment, we use storage swaps
    and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage
    opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the
    original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural
    gas inventory, basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic
    value of our fixed price and storage books and various

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options. These financial instruments have
    not been designated as hedges.

We record our financial instruments as a component of risk
    management assets and liabilities, which are classified as
    current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date
    of the underlying financial instrument. Substantially all of our
    financial instruments are valued using external market quotes
    and indices.

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits Obligations

Net
    Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit Costs

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, our total net
    periodic pension and other benefits costs was
    $50.2 million, compared with $47.9 million and
    $48.6 million for the fiscal years ended September 30,
    2008 and 2007. These costs relating to our natural gas
    distribution operations are recoverable through our gas
    distribution rates. A portion of these costs is capitalized into
    our gas distribution rate base, and the remaining costs are
    recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense.

The increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits
    costs during fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 primarily
    reflects the change in assumptions we made during our annual
    pension plan valuation completed September 30, 2008. The
    discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan’s
    liabilities generally is based on rates of high-grade corporate
    bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which
    the benefits will be paid. At our September 30, 2008
    measurement date, the interest rates were approximately
    130 basis points higher than the interest rates at
    June 30, 2007, the measurement date used to determine our
    fiscal 2008 net periodic cost. The corresponding increase
    in the discount rate was the primary



driver for the increase in our fiscal 2009 pension and benefit
    costs. Our expected return on our pension plan assets remained
    constant at 8.25 percent.

The periodic pension and other benefits costs remained
    relatively unchanged during fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal
    2007 as the assumptions we made during our annual pension plan
    valuation completed June 30, 2007 were consistent with the
    prior year. At our June 30, 2007 measurement date, the
    interest rates were consistent with rates at our prior-year
    measurement date, which resulted in no change to our
    6.30 percent discount rate used to determine our fiscal
    2008 net periodic and post-retirement cost. In addition,
    our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant
    at 8.25 percent.

Pension
    and Postretirement Plan Funding

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an
    amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to
    comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
    including the funding requirements under the Pension Protection
    Act of 2006 (PPA). However, additional voluntary contributions
    are made from time to time as considered necessary.
    Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits
    attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be
    earned in the future.

During fiscal 2009, we contributed $21.0 million in cash to
    our pension plans to achieve a desired level of funding for the
    2008 plan year while maximizing the tax deductibility of this
    payment. The need for this funding reflected the decline in the
    fair value of the plans’ assets resulting from the
    unfavorable market conditions experienced during the latter half
    of calendar year 2008. This contribution increased the level of
    our plan assets to achieve a desirable funding threshold as
    established by the PPA. During fiscal 2008, we voluntarily
    contributed $2.3 million to the Atmos Energy Corporation
    Retirement Plan for Mississippi Valley Gas Union Employees. This
    contribution achieved a desired level of funding for this plan
    for the 2007 plan year. During fiscal 2007, we did not
    contribute to our pension plans.

We contributed $10.1 million, $9.6 million and
    $11.8 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the
    fiscal years ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The
    contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs
    we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum
    funding required by state regulatory commissions.

Outlook
    for Fiscal 2010

As of September 30, 2009, interest and corporate bond rates
    utilized to determine our discount rates, which impacted our
    fiscal 2010 net periodic pension and postretirement costs,
    were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of
    September 30, 2008, the measurement date for our fiscal
    2009 net periodic cost. As a result of the lower interest
    and corporate bond rates, we decreased the discount rate used to
    determine our fiscal 2010 pension and benefit costs to
    5.52 percent. We maintained the expected return on our
    pension plan assets at 8.25 percent, despite the recent
    decline in the financial markets as we believe this rate
    reflects the average rate of expected earnings on plan assets
    that will fund our projected benefit obligation. Although the
    fair value of our plan assets has declined as the financial
    markets have declined, the impact of this decline is mitigated
    by the fact that assets are smoothed for purposes of determining
    net periodic pension cost which results in asset gains and
    losses that are recognized over time as a component of net
    periodic pension and benefit costs for our Pension Account Plan,
    our largest funded plan. Accordingly, we expect our fiscal 2010
    pension and postretirement medical costs to be materially the
    same as in fiscal 2009. Based upon market conditions subsequent
    to September 30, 2009, the current funded position of the
    plans and the new funding requirements under the PPA, we believe
    it is reasonably possible that we will be required to contribute
    to the Plans in fiscal 2010. Further, we will consider whether
    an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain
    certain PPA funding thresholds. However, we cannot anticipate
    with certainty whether such contributions will be made and the
    amount of such contributions. With respect to our postretirement
    medical plans, we anticipate contributing approximately
    $12.2 million during fiscal 2010.

As of September 30, 2009, the Board of Directors approved a
    change to the cost sharing methodology for employees who had not
    met the participation requirements by that date for the Retiree
    Medical Plan for Retirees and Disabled Employees of Atmos Energy
    Corporation (the “Retiree Medical Plan”). Starting in
    five



years, on January 1, 2015, the contribution rates that will
    apply to all non-grandfathered participants will be determined
    using a new cost sharing methodology by which Atmos Energy will
    limit its contribution to a three percent cost increase in
    claims and administrative costs each year. If medical costs
    covered by the Retiree Medical Plan increase more than three
    percent annually, participants will be responsible for the
    additional cost.

During the last fiscal year, the Company has worked with our
    independent compensation consultant to develop and implement a
    new SERP design for any new executives or current employees
    selected for participation in the SERP arrangement on a
    prospective basis. Only those executives who are currently
    members of our Management Committee as well as those individuals
    who may be selected in the future to serve on the Management
    Committee, plus those executives who are active SERP
    participants as of August 5, 2009, will continue to
    participate in the current SERP arrangement until their
    respective retirement dates. The current SERP arrangement is a
    60 percent of covered compensation defined benefit
    arrangement in which benefits from the underlying qualified
    defined benefit plan are an offset to the SERP benefit. The new
    SERP arrangement for new participants in the Company’s
    executive retirement program is a modified defined benefit
    approach in which the Company will contribute to a nominal
    account for each participant, an amount equal to ten percent of
    each participant’s base salary and bonus following the
    participant’s completion of a plan year of service. Other
    provisions of the plan mirror that of the Company’s
    underlying qualified plan, the Pension Account Plan. At this
    time, only one employee has been selected for participation in
    the new SERP arrangement.

The projected pension liability, future funding requirements and
    the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the Plan
    are subject to change, depending upon the actuarial value of
    plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations
    as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date. These amounts
    are impacted by actual investment returns, changes in interest
    rates and changes in the demographic composition of the
    participants in the plan.

RECENT
    ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

Recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows are described in
    Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and
    interest rates. Commodity price risk is the potential loss that
    we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a
    particular instrument or commodity. Interest-rate risk results
    from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue
    to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities.

We conduct risk management activities through both our natural
    gas distribution and natural gas marketing segments. In our
    natural gas distribution segment, we use a combination of
    physical storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed financial
    contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually
    large winter period gas price increases. In our natural gas
    marketing segment, we manage our exposure to the risk of natural
    gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a
    combination of storage and financial instruments including
    futures,

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with
    counterparties. Our risk management activities and related
    accounting treatment are described in further detail in
    Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
    Additionally, our earnings are affected by changes in short-term
    interest rates as a result of our issuance of short-term
    commercial paper and our other short-term borrowings.

Commodity
    Price Risk

Natural
    gas distribution segment

We purchase natural gas for our natural gas distribution
    operations. Substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for
    natural gas distribution operations are recovered from our
    customers through purchased gas cost



adjustment mechanisms. Therefore, our natural gas distribution
    operations have limited commodity price risk exposure.

Natural
    gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other
    segments

Our natural gas marketing segment is also exposed to risks
    associated with changes in the market price of natural gas. For
    our natural gas marketing segment, we use a sensitivity analysis
    to estimate commodity price risk. For purposes of this analysis,
    we estimate commodity price risk by applying a $0.50 change in
    the forward NYMEX price to our net open position (including
    existing storage and related financial contracts) at the end of
    each period. Based on AEH’s net open position (including
    existing storage and related financial contracts) at
    September 30, 2009 of 0.4 Bcf, a $0.50 change in the
    forward NYMEX price would have had a $0.2 million impact on
    our consolidated net income.

Changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to
    market our physical inventory (Gas Daily) and the related
    fair-value hedge (NYMEX) can result in volatility in our
    reported net income; but, over time, gains and losses on the
    sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses
    on the fair-value hedges. Based upon our net physical position
    at September 30, 2009 and assuming our hedges would still
    qualify as highly effective, a $0.50 change in the difference
    between the Gas Daily and NYMEX indices would impact our
    reported net income by approximately $5.2 million.

Additionally, these changes could cause us to recognize a risk
    management liability, which would require us to place cash into
    an escrow account to collateralize this liability position.
    This, in turn, would reduce the amount of cash we would have on
    hand to fund our working capital needs.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our earnings are exposed to changes in short-term interest rates
    associated with our short-term commercial paper program and
    other short-term borrowings. We use a sensitivity analysis to
    estimate our short-term interest rate risk. For purposes of this
    analysis, we estimate our short-term interest rate risk as the
    difference between our actual interest expense for the period
    and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a
    hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates
    associated with our short-term borrowings. Had interest rates
    associated with our short-term borrowings increased by an
    average of one percent, our interest expense would have
    increased by approximately $3.7 million during 2009.

As of September 30, 2009, we were not engaged in other
    activities that would cause exposure to the risk of material
    earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or
    market commodity prices.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Atmos Energy Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Atmos Energy Corporation as of September 30, 2009 and 2008,
    and the related consolidated statements of income,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended September 30, 2009. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    Index at Item 8. These financial statements and schedule
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Atmos Energy Corporation at
    September 30, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results
    of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
    in the period ended September 30, 2009, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the financial statements taken as a
    whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Atmos Energy Corporation’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2009,
    based on criteria established in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
    November 16, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Nature of
    Business

Atmos Energy Corporation (“Atmos Energy” or the
    “Company”) and our subsidiaries are engaged primarily
    in the regulated natural gas distribution and transmission and
    storage businesses as well as certain other nonregulated
    businesses. Through our natural gas distribution business, we
    deliver natural gas through sales and transportation
    arrangements to over 3 million residential, commercial,
    public-authority and industrial customers through our six
    regulated natural gas distribution divisions in the service
    areas described below:

Denotes locations where we have more limited service areas.

In addition, we transport natural gas for others through our
    distribution system. Our natural gas distribution business is
    subject to federal and state regulation

and/or

regulation by local authorities in each of the states in which
    our natural gas distribution divisions operate. Our corporate
    headquarters and shared-services function are located in Dallas,
    Texas, and our customer support centers are located in Amarillo
    and Waco, Texas.

Our regulated transmission and storage business consists of the
    regulated operations of our Atmos Pipeline — Texas
    Division, a division of the Company. This division transports
    natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division, transports natural gas for
    third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in
    Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary to the
    pipeline industry including parking arrangements, lending and
    sales of inventory on hand. Parking arrangements provide
    short-term interruptible storage of gas on our pipeline. Lending
    services provide short-term interruptible loans of natural gas
    from our pipeline to meet market demands.

Our nonregulated businesses operate primarily in the Midwest and
    Southeast and include our natural gas marketing operations and
    our pipeline, storage and other operations. These businesses are
    operated through various wholly-owned subsidiaries of Atmos
    Energy Holdings, Inc. (AEH), which is wholly-owned by the
    Company and based in Houston, Texas.

Our natural gas marketing operations are managed by Atmos Energy
    Marketing, LLC (AEM), which is wholly-owned by AEH. AEM provides
    a variety of natural gas management services to municipalities,
    natural gas utility systems and industrial natural gas
    customers, primarily in the southeastern and midwestern states
    and to our Colorado-Kansas, Kentucky/Mid-States and Louisiana
    divisions. These services consist primarily of furnishing
    natural gas supplies at fixed and market-based prices, contract
    negotiation and administration, load forecasting, gas storage
    acquisition and management services, transportation services,
    peaking sales and balancing services, capacity utilization
    strategies and gas price hedging through the use of financial
    instruments.

Our pipeline, storage and other segment consists primarily of
    the operations of Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC (APS). APS is
    engaged in nonregulated transmission, storage and natural
    gas-gathering services. Its primary asset is a proprietary
    21 mile pipeline located in New Orleans, Louisiana that is
    primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural
    gas distribution division in Louisiana and for our natural gas

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

marketing segment, and, on a more limited basis, to third
    parties. APS also owns or has an interest in underground storage
    fields in Kentucky and Louisiana that are used to reduce the
    need of our natural gas distribution divisions to contract for
    additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak
    periods.

APS also engages in asset optimization activities whereby it
    seeks to maximize the economic value associated with the storage
    and transportation capacity it owns or controls. Certain of
    these arrangements are with regulated affiliates of the Company
    which have been approved by applicable state regulatory
    commissions. Generally, these asset management plans require APS
    to share with our regulated customers a portion of the profits
    earned from these arrangements. APS also seeks to maximize the
    economic value associated with the storage and transportation
    capacity it owns or controls by engaging in natural gas storage
    transactions in which we seek to find and profit from the
    pricing differences that occur over time.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation

— The accompanying
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Atmos
    Energy Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
    material intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Use of estimates

— The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The most significant
    estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, legal and
    environmental accruals, insurance accruals, pension and
    postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes, asset
    retirement obligations, impairment of long-lived assets, risk
    management and trading activities, fair value measurements and
    the valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets
    and other long-lived assets. Actual results could differ from
    those estimates.

Regulation

— Our natural gas distribution and
    regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to
    regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of
    accounting records and various other matters by the respective
    regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. Our
    accounting policies recognize the financial effects of the
    ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various
    regulatory commissions. Accounting principles generally accepted
    in the United States require cost-based, rate-regulated entities
    that meet certain criteria to reflect the authorized recovery of
    costs due to regulatory decisions in their financial statements.
    As a result, certain costs are permitted to be capitalized
    rather than expensed because they can be recovered through rates.

We record regulatory assets as a component of other current
    assets and deferred charges and other assets for costs that have
    been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates
    is considered probable. Regulatory liabilities are recorded
    either on the face of the balance sheet or as a component of
    current liabilities, deferred income taxes or deferred credits
    and other liabilities when it is probable that revenues will

be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers
    through the ratemaking process. Significant regulatory assets
    and liabilities as of September 30, 2009 and 2008 included

Currently authorized rates do not include a return on certain of
    our merger and integration costs; however, we recover the
    amortization of these costs. Merger and integration costs, net,
    are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated
    useful lives ranging up to 20 years. Environmental costs
    have been deferred to be included in future rate filings in
    accordance with rulings received from various state regulatory
    commissions. During the fiscal years ended September 30,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized $0.4 million,
    $0.4 million and $0.3 million in amortization expense
    related to these costs.

Revenue recognition

— Sales of natural gas to
    our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly
    basis; however, the billing cycle periods for certain classes of
    customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods
    used for financial reporting purposes. We follow the revenue
    accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution
    segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to
    customers, but not yet billed under the cycle billing method,
    are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to
    expense. During the year ended September 30, 2009 we
    recognized a non-recurring $7.6 million increase in gross
    profit associated with a one-time update to our estimate for gas
    delivered to customers but not yet billed, resulting from base
    rate changes in several jurisdictions.

On occasion, we are permitted to implement new rates that have
    not been formally approved by our state regulatory commissions,
    which are subject to refund. As permitted by accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States, we recognize
    this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be
    refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which
    the rates were implemented.

Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for
    increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through
    purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas cost
    adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of
    recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without
    filing a rate case to address all of the utility company’s
    non-gas costs. There is no gross profit generated through
    purchased gas cost adjustments, but they provide a
    dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or decreases in our
    natural gas



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

distribution segment’s gas costs. The effects of these
    purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms are recorded as
    deferred gas costs on our balance sheet.

Operating revenues for our natural gas marketing segment and the
    associated carrying value of natural gas inventory (inclusive of
    storage costs) are recognized when we sell the gas and
    physically deliver it to our customers. Operating revenues
    include realized gains and losses arising from the settlement of
    financial instruments used in our natural gas marketing
    activities and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes
    in the fair value of natural gas inventory designated as a
    hedged item in a fair value hedge and the associated financial
    instruments. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, we included unrealized gains (losses) on open
    contracts of $(28.4) million, $25.5 million and
    $18.4 million as a component of natural gas marketing
    revenues.

Operating revenues for our regulated transmission and storage
    and pipeline, storage and other segments are recognized in the
    period in which actual volumes are transported and storage
    services are provided.

Cash and cash equivalents

— We consider all
    highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
    months or less to be cash equivalents.

Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts

— Accounts receivable arise from natural gas sales
    to residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and other
    customers. For the majority of our receivables, we establish an
    allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collection
    experience. On certain other receivables where we are aware of a
    specific customer’s inability or reluctance to pay, we
    record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to
    reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably
    expect to collect. However, if circumstances change, our
    estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be
    affected. Circumstances which could affect our estimates
    include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, the
    level of natural gas prices, customer deposits and general
    economic conditions. Accounts are written off once they are
    deemed to be uncollectible.

Gas stored underground

— Our gas stored
    underground is comprised of natural gas injected into storage to
    support the winter season withdrawals for our natural gas
    distribution operations and natural gas held by our natural gas
    marketing and other nonregulated subsidiaries to conduct their
    operations. The average cost method is used for all our
    regulated operations, except for certain jurisdictions in the
    Kentucky/Mid-States Division, where it is valued on the

first-in

first-out method basis, in accordance with regulatory
    requirements. Our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage
    and other segments utilize the average cost method; however,
    most of this inventory is hedged and is therefore reported at
    fair value at the end of each month. Gas in storage that is
    retained as cushion gas to maintain reservoir pressure is
    classified as property, plant and equipment and is valued at
    cost.

Regulated property, plant and equipment

— Regulated property, plant and equipment is
    stated at original cost, net of contributions in aid of
    construction. The cost of additions includes direct construction
    costs, payroll related costs (taxes, pensions and other fringe
    benefits), administrative and general costs and an allowance for
    funds used during construction. The allowance for funds used
    during construction represents the estimated cost of funds used
    to finance the construction of major projects and are
    capitalized in the rate base for ratemaking purposes when the
    completed projects are placed in service. Interest expense of
    $4.9 million, $2.9 million and $3.0 million was
    capitalized in 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Major renewals, including replacement pipe, and betterments that
    are recoverable under our regulatory rate base are capitalized
    while the costs of maintenance and repairs that are not
    recoverable through rates are charged to expense as incurred.
    The costs of large projects are accumulated in construction in
    progress until the project is completed. When the project is
    completed, tested and placed in service, the balance is
    transferred to the regulated plant in service account included
    in the rate base and depreciation begins.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Regulated property, plant and equipment is depreciated at
    various rates on a straight-line basis. These rates are approved
    by our regulatory commissions and are comprised of two
    components: one based on average service life and one based on
    cost of removal. Accordingly, we recognize our cost of removal
    expense as a component of depreciation expense. The related cost
    of removal accrual is reflected as a regulatory liability on the
    consolidated balance sheet. At the time property, plant and
    equipment is retired, removal expenses less salvage, are charged
    to the regulatory cost of removal accrual. The composite
    depreciation rate was 3.8 percent, 3.7 percent and
    3.9 percent for the fiscal years ended September 30,
    2009, 2008 and 2007.

Nonregulated property, plant and equipment

— Nonregulated property, plant and equipment is
    stated at cost. Depreciation is generally computed on the
    straight-line method for financial reporting purposes based upon
    estimated useful lives ranging from three to 35 years.

Asset retirement obligations

— We record a
    liability at fair value for an asset retirement obligation when
    the legal obligation to retire the asset has been incurred with
    an offsetting increase to the carrying value of the related
    asset. Accretion of the asset retirement obligation due to the
    passage of time is recorded as an operating expense.

As of September 30, 2009 and 2008, we recorded asset
    retirement obligations of $13.0 million and
    $5.9 million. Additionally, we recorded $3.9 million
    and $1.3 million of asset retirement costs as a component
    of property, plant and equipment that will be depreciated over
    the remaining life of the underlying associated assets.

We believe we have a legal obligation to retire our natural gas
    storage wells when we take them out of service period
    permanently. However, we have not recognized an asset retirement
    obligation associated with our storage wells because we are not
    able to determine the settlement date of this obligation as we
    do not anticipate taking our storage wells out of service
    permanently. Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the fair
    value of this obligation.

Impairment of long-lived assets

— We
    periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have
    occurred that indicate that other long-lived assets may not be
    recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant
    revision. When such events or circumstances are present, we
    assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining
    whether the carrying value will be recovered through the
    expected future cash flows. In the event the sum of the expected
    future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less
    than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss equal
    to the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair
    value is recorded.

During fiscal 2007, we recorded a $6.3 million charge
    associated with the write-off of approximately $3.0 million
    of costs related to a nonregulated natural gas gathering project
    and approximately $3.3 million of obsolete software costs.

Goodwill and intangible assets

— We annually
    evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second
    fiscal quarter or more frequently as impairment indicators
    arise. We use a present value technique based on discounted cash
    flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. These
    calculations are dependent on several subjective factors
    including the timing of future cash flows, future growth rates
    and the discount rate. An impairment charge is recognized if the
    carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its
    fair value.

Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives of
    10 years. These assets are reviewed for impairment as
    impairment indicators arise. When such events or circumstances
    are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets
    by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered
    through the expected future cash flows. In the event the sum of
    the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the
    asset is less than the carrying value of the asset, an
    impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset’s carrying
    value over its fair value is recorded. No impairment has been
    recognized.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Marketable securities

— As of
    September 30, 2009 and 2008, all of our marketable
    securities were classified as available-for-sale. In accordance
    with the authoritative accounting standards, these securities
    are reported at market value with unrealized gains and losses
    shown as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss). We regularly evaluate the performance of these
    investments on a fund by fund basis for impairment, taking into
    consideration the fund’s purpose, volatility and current
    returns. If a determination is made that a decline in fair value
    is other than temporary, the related fund is written down to its
    estimated fair value.

Due to the deterioration of the financial markets in late
    calendar 2008 and early calendar 2009 and the uncertainty of a
    full recovery of these investments given the current economic
    environment, we recorded a $5.4 million noncash charge to
    impair certain available-for-sale investments during fiscal 2009.

Financial instruments and hedging activities

— We currently use financial instruments to
    mitigate commodity price risk. Additionally, we periodically use
    financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. The
    objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have
    been tailored for our regulated and nonregulated businesses.
    Currently, we utilize financial instruments in our natural gas
    distribution, natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and
    other segments. The objectives and strategies for the use of
    financial instruments are discussed in Note 4.

We record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet
    at fair value

,

with changes in fair value ultimately
    recorded in the income statement. These financial instruments
    are reported as risk management assets and liabilities and are
    classified as current or noncurrent other assets or liabilities
    based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying
    financial instrument.

The timing of when changes in fair value of our financial
    instruments are recorded in the income statement depends on
    whether the financial instrument has been designated and
    qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory
    rulings require a different accounting treatment. Changes in
    fair value for financial instruments that do not meet one of
    these criteria are recognized in the income statement as they
    occur.

Financial
    Instruments Associated with Commodity Price Risk

In our natural gas distribution segment, the costs associated
    with and the gains and losses arising from the use of financial
    instruments to mitigate commodity price risk are included in our
    purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms in accordance with
    regulatory requirements. Therefore, changes in the fair value of
    these financial instruments are initially recorded as a
    component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the
    consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas
    cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and
    recognized in revenue in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, there is
    no earnings impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a
    result of the use of financial instruments.

In our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other
    segments, we have designated the natural gas inventory held by
    these operating segments as the hedged item in a fair-value
    hedge. This inventory is marked to market at the end of each
    month based on the Gas Daily index, with changes in fair value
    recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the
    period of change. The financial instruments associated with this
    natural gas inventory have been designated as fair-value hedges
    and are marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price
    with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or
    losses in revenue in the period of change. Changes in the
    spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the
    financial hedges designated against our physical inventory
    (NYMEX) and the market (spot) prices used to value our physical
    storage (Gas Daily) result in unrealized margins until the
    underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial
    instruments are settled. Once the gas is withdrawn and the
    financial instruments are settled, the previously unrealized
    margins associated with these net positions are realized. We
    have elected to exclude this spot/forward differential for
    purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fair-value
    hedges.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Over time, we expect gains and losses on the sale of storage gas
    inventory to be offset by gains and losses on the fair-value
    hedges, resulting in the realization of the economic gross
    profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the
    original transaction.

In our natural gas marketing segment, we have elected to treat
    fixed-price forward contracts to deliver natural gas as normal
    purchases and normal sales. As such, these deliveries are
    recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with our revenue
    recognition policy. Financial instruments used to mitigate the
    commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been
    designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and
    sales at indexed prices. Accordingly, unrealized gains and
    losses on these open financial instruments are recorded as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and are
    recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged
    volumes are sold. Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred,
    is reported as a component of revenue.

Gains and losses from hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in
    the income statement. Fair value and cash flow hedge
    ineffectiveness arising from natural gas market price
    differences between the locations of the hedged inventory and
    the delivery location specified in the financial instruments is
    referred to as basis ineffectiveness. Ineffectiveness arising
    from changes in the fair value of the fair value hedges due to
    changes in the difference between the spot price and the futures
    price, as well as the difference between the timing of the
    settlement of the futures and the valuation of the underlying
    physical commodity are referred to as timing ineffectiveness.

In our natural gas marketing segment, we also utilize master
    netting agreements with significant counterparties that allow us
    to offset gains and losses arising from financial instruments
    that may be settled in cash with gains and losses arising from
    financial instruments that may be settled with the physical
    commodity. Assets and liabilities from risk management
    activities, as well as accounts receivable and payable, reflect
    the master netting agreements in place. Additionally, the
    accounting guidance for master netting arrangements requires us
    to include the fair value of cash collateral or the obligation
    to return cash in the amounts that have been netted under master
    netting agreements used to offset gains and losses arising from
    financial instruments. The Company adopted this standard as of
    September 30, 2008. As of September 30, 2009 and 2008,
    the Company netted $11.7 million and $56.6 million of
    cash held in margin accounts into its current risk management
    assets and liabilities.

Financial
    Instruments Associated with Interest Rate Risk

We periodically manage interest rate risk, typically when we
    issue new or refinance existing long-term debt. Currently, we do
    not have any financial instruments in place to manage interest
    rate risk. However, in prior years, we entered into Treasury
    lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the
    interest cost associated with anticipated financings. We
    designated these Treasury lock agreements as a cash flow hedge
    of an anticipated transaction at the time the agreements were
    executed. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses associated
    with the Treasury lock agreements were recorded as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). When the
    Treasury locks were settled, the realized gain or loss was
    recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) and is being recognized as a component of interest
    expense over the life of the related financing arrangement.

Fair Value Measurements —

We report certain
    assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the
    price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
    transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants at the measurement date (exit price). We primarily
    use quoted market prices and other observable market pricing
    information in valuing our financial assets and liabilities and
    minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our
    measurements.

Prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to
    determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities
    recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. Within our
    nonregulated operations, we utilize a

    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point between the bid and
    ask prices) as a practical expedient for determining fair value
    measurement, as permitted under current accounting standards.
    Values derived from these sources reflect the market in which
    transactions involving these financial instruments are executed.
    We utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair
    value when external sources are not available. Values are
    adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly
    liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time
    under then-current market conditions. We believe the market
    prices and models used to value these assets and liabilities
    represent the best information available with respect to closing
    exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time value and
    volatility factors underlying the assets and liabilities.

Fair-value estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and
    the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved. Our
    counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and
    major energy companies. This concentration of counterparties may
    materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from
    market, economic or regulatory conditions. Recent adverse
    developments in the global financial and credit markets have
    made it more difficult and more expensive for companies to
    access the short-term capital markets, which may negatively
    impact the creditworthiness of our counterparties. A continued
    tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our
    counterparties to fail to perform. We seek to minimize
    counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their
    financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral
    requirements under certain circumstances.

Amounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially
    significant volatility based upon changes in market prices, the
    valuation of the portfolio of our contracts, maturity and
    settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions,
    each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our
    financial instruments. We believe the market prices and models
    used to value these financial instruments represent the best
    information available with respect to closing exchange and
    over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility factors
    underlying the contracts. Values are adjusted to reflect the
    potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over
    a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions.

Authoritative accounting literature establishes a fair value
    hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value
    based on observable and unobservable data. The hierarchy
    categorizes the inputs into three levels, with the highest
    priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the
    lowest priority given to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The
    levels of the hierarchy are described below:

Level 1

— Unadjusted quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active
    market for the asset or liability is defined as a market in
    which transactions for the asset or liability occur with
    sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information
    on an ongoing basis. Our Level 1 measurements consist
    primarily of exchange-traded financial instruments, gas stored
    underground that has been designated as the hedged item in a
    fair value hedge and our available-for-sale securities.

Level 2

— Pricing inputs other than quoted
    prices included in Level 1 that are either directly or
    indirectly observable for the asset or liability as of the
    reporting date. These inputs are derived principally from, or
    corroborated by, observable market data. Our Level 2
    measurements primarily consist of non-exchange-traded financial
    instruments, such as over-the-counter options and swaps where
    market data for pricing is observable.

Level 3

— Generally unobservable pricing
    inputs which are developed based on the best information
    available, including our own internal data, in situations where
    there is little if any market activity for the asset or
    liability at the measurement date. The pricing inputs utilized
    reflect what a market participant would use to determine fair
    value. Currently, we have no assets or liabilities recorded at
    fair value that would qualify for Level 3 reporting.

Pension and other postretirement plans

—
    Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are
    determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous
    assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan
    assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed
    discount rates and current



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

demographic and actuarial mortality data. Through fiscal 2008,
    we reviewed the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension
    and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities annually
    based upon a June 30 measurement date. To comply with the new
    measurement date requirements established by the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and incorporated into
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
    effective October 1, 2008, we changed our measurement date
    from June 30 to our fiscal year end, September 30. This
    change is more fully discussed in Note 8. The assumed
    discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that
    generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs
    and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health
    care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally
    have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan
    costs and liabilities.

The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the
    actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement
    obligation and net pension and postretirement cost. When
    establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality
    corporate bond rates, changes in those rates from the prior year
    and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our
    projected benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate
    bond spot rate curve.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in
    calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the
    annual pension and postretirement plan cost. We estimate the
    expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond
    returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of
    active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset
    rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the
    guidance from our investment advisors in making a final
    determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the
    extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the
    course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate,
    that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan cost is
    not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases
    future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of
    approximately ten to twelve years.

We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in
    determining our annual postretirement net cost based upon our
    actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently
    enacted legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed
    rate of retirement is estimated based upon the annual review of
    our participant census information as of the measurement date.

Income taxes

— Income taxes are provided based
    on the liability method, which results in income tax assets and
    liabilities arising from temporary differences. Temporary
    differences are differences between the tax bases of assets and
    liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial
    statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in
    future years. The liability method requires the effect of tax
    rate changes on current and accumulated deferred income taxes to
    be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted.
    The liability method also requires that deferred tax assets be
    reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than
    not that the assets will be realized.

The Company may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax
    positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the
    tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
    authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The
    tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a
    position should be measured based on the largest benefit that
    has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized
    upon settlement with the taxing authorities. We recognize
    accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as a
    component of interest expense. We recognize penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits as a component of miscellaneous income
    (expense) in accordance with regulatory requirements.

Stock-based compensation plans

— We maintain
    the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan that provides for the granting
    of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock
    appreciation rights, bonus stock, time-lapse restricted stock,
    time-lapse restricted stock units, performance-based restricted
    stock units and stock units to officers, division presidents and
    other key employees. Non-employee directors are also eligible to
    receive stock-based compensation under the 1998 Long-Term
    Incentive Plan. The objectives of this plan include

attracting and retaining the best personnel, providing for
    additional performance incentives and promoting our success by
    providing employees with the opportunity to acquire our common
    stock.

Subsequent events

—  In May 2009, the FASB
    issued guidance related to subsequent events which establishes
    general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events
    that occur after the balance sheet date but before the date the
    financial statements are issued or available to be issued.
    Companies are required to reflect in their financial statements
    the effects of subsequent events that provide additional
    evidence about conditions at the balance-sheet date. Subsequent
    events that provide evidence about conditions that arose after
    the balance-sheet date should be disclosed if the financial
    statements would otherwise be misleading. We adopted the
    provisions of this guidance as of June 30, 2009.

We have evaluated subsequent events from the September 30,
    2009 balance sheet date through the date these financial
    statements were filed with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission. No events occurred subsequent to the balance sheet
    date that would require recognition or disclosure in the
    financial statements.

Recent accounting pronouncements

— In June
    2009, the FASB issued an update to the accounting for transfers
    of financial assets. This guidance clarifies the information
    that must be disclosed related to a transfer of financial
    assets; the effects of a transfer on the transferor’s
    financial position, financial performance, and cash flows; and a
    transferor’s continuing involvement, if any, in transferred
    financial assets. The standard also removes the concept of a
    qualifying special-purpose entity for accounting purposes.
    Therefore, after the effective date, formerly qualifying
    special-purpose entities (as defined under previous accounting
    standards) must be evaluated for consolidation by companies on
    and after the effective date in accordance with the applicable
    consolidation guidance. The provisions of this standard will be
    effective for us beginning October 1, 2009. The adoption of
    this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2009, the FASB issued an update to the criteria used to
    determine if an entity has a controlling interest in a variable
    interest entity. The updated criteria are intended to be
    primarily qualitative and result in a more effective method for
    identifying which enterprise has a controlling financial
    interest in a variable interest entity. Additionally, the
    standard enhances the disclosure requirements for entities that
    hold a variable interest in a variable interest entity. The
    provisions of this standard will be effective for us beginning
    October 1, 2009. The adoption of this standard is not
    expected to have a material impact on our financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2009, the FASB issued the

FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification

(Codification) which supersedes all existing
    non-SEC accounting and reporting standards and becomes the
    source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles (GAAP) recognized by the FASB to be applied by
    nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under authority of
    federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP
    for SEC registrants. All other nongrandfathered non-SEC
    accounting literature not included in the Codification will
    become nonauthoritative



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

upon the effective date. The Codification is effective for us
    for the year ended September 30, 2009. The adoption of this
    standard did not have an impact on our financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2008, the FASB issued guidance which requires
    employers to disclose information about fair value measurements
    of plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other
    postretirement plan in a manner similar to the requirements
    established for financial and non-financial assets. The
    objectives of the required disclosures are to provide users of
    financial statements with an understanding of how investment
    allocation decisions are made, the major categories of plan
    assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair
    value of plan assets and significant concentrations of risk
    within plan assets. The provisions of this standard will be
    effective for us beginning October 1, 2009. This standard
    is not expected to have a material impact on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2008, the FASB issued guidance related to determining
    whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions
    are participating securities. Based on this guidance, the
    Company will include non-vested shares granted under its 1998
    Long-Term Incentive Plan in the basic earnings per share
    calculation. The provisions of this standard will be effective
    for us beginning October 1, 2009, at which time all
    prior-period earnings per share data will be adjusted. This
    standard is not expected to have a material impact on our
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2008, the FASB issued guidance which amends the factors
    that should be considered in developing renewal or extension
    assumptions used to determine the useful life of intangible
    assets. The objective of the standard is to better match the
    useful life of intangible assets to the cash flow generated. The
    provisions of this standard will be effective for us beginning
    October 1, 2009. This standard is not expected to have a
    material impact on our financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued an update to business
    combination accounting. The new pronouncement establishes
    principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business
    combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements
    the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and
    any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition
    date fair value. This update significantly changes the
    accounting for business combinations in a number of areas,
    including the treatment of contingent consideration,
    preacquisition contingencies, transaction costs and
    restructuring costs. In addition, under the new guidelines,
    changes in an acquired entity’s deferred tax assets and
    uncertain tax positions after the measurement period could
    impact income tax expense. The provisions of this standard will
    apply to any acquisitions we complete after October 1, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance related to the
    accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be
    recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a
    component of equity. This new consolidation method significantly
    changes the accounting for transactions with minority interest
    holders. The provisions of the standard will be effective for us
    beginning October 1, 2009. This standard is not expected to
    have a material impact on our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Financial
    Instruments

We currently use financial instruments to mitigate commodity
    price risk. Additionally, we periodically utilize financial
    instruments to manage interest rate risk. The objectives and
    strategies for using financial instruments have been tailored to
    our regulated and nonregulated businesses. Currently, we utilize
    financial instruments in our natural gas distribution, natural
    gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments. However,
    our pipeline, storage and other segment uses financial
    instruments acquired from AEM on the same terms that AEM
    received from an independent counterparty. On a consolidated
    basis, these financial instruments are reported in the natural
    gas marketing segment.

As discussed in Note 2, we report our financial instruments
    as risk management assets and liabilities, each of which is
    classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated
    settlement date of the

    management assets.

Regulated
    Commodity Risk Management Activities

Although our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms
    essentially insulate our natural gas distribution segment from
    commodity price risk, our natural gas distribution customers are
    exposed to the effect of volatile natural gas prices. We manage
    this exposure through a combination of physical storage,
    fixed-price forward contracts and financial instruments,
    primarily over-the-counter swap and option contracts, in an
    effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on
    our customers during the winter heating season.

Our natural gas distribution gas supply department is
    responsible for executing this segment’s commodity risk
    management activities in conformity with regulatory
    requirements. In jurisdictions where we are permitted to
    mitigate commodity price risk through financial instruments, the
    relevant regulatory authorities may establish the level of
    heating season gas purchases that can be hedged. Historically,
    if the regulatory authority does not establish this level, we
    seek to hedge between 25 and 50 percent of anticipated
    heating season gas purchases using financial instruments. For
    the

2008-2009

heating season, in the jurisdictions where we are permitted to
    utilize financial instruments, we hedged approximately
    27 percent, or 24.3 Bcf of the planned winter flowing
    gas requirements at a weighted average cost of approximately
    $10.15 per Mcf.

We currently do not manage commodity price risk with financial
    instruments in our regulated transmission and storage segment.

Nonregulated
    Commodity Risk Management Activities

Our natural gas marketing segment, through AEM, aggregates and
    purchases gas supply, arranges transportation

and/or

storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers
    at competitive prices. To



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

facilitate this process, we utilize proprietary and
    customer-owned transportation and storage assets to provide the
    various services our customers’ request.

We also perform asset optimization activities in both our
    natural gas marketing segment and pipeline, storage and other
    segment. Through asset optimization activities, we seek to
    enhance our gross profit by maximizing the economic value
    associated with the storage and transportation capacity we own
    or control. We attempt to meet this objective by engaging in
    natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and
    profit from the pricing differences that occur over time. We
    purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial
    instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit
    margin. Through the use of transportation and storage services
    and financial instruments, we also seek to capture gross profit
    margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences that exist
    in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that
    occur over time. Over time, gains and losses on the sale of
    storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the
    financial instruments, resulting in the realization of the
    economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we
    structured the original transaction.

As a result of these activities, our nonregulated operations are
    exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of
    natural gas. We manage our exposure to such risks through a
    combination of physical storage and financial instruments,
    including futures, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options
    and swap contracts with counterparties. Future contracts provide
    the right to buy or sell the commodity at a fixed price in the
    future. Option contracts provide the right, but not the
    requirement, to buy or sell the commodity at a fixed price. Swap
    contracts require receipt of payment for the commodity based on
    the difference between a fixed price and the market price on the
    settlement date.

We use financial instruments, designated as cash flow hedges of
    anticipated purchases and sales at index prices, to mitigate the
    commodity price risk in our natural gas marketing segment
    associated with deliveries under fixed-priced forward contracts
    to deliver gas to customers, and we use financial instruments,
    designated as fair value hedges, to hedge our natural gas
    inventory used in our asset optimization activities in our
    natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments.

Also, in our natural gas marketing segment, we use storage swaps
    and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage
    opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the
    original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural
    gas inventory, basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic
    value of our fixed price and storage books and various
    over-the-counter and exchange-traded options. These financial
    instruments have not been designated as hedges.

Our nonregulated risk management activities are controlled
    through various risk management policies and procedures. Our
    Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for our
    nonregulated risk management limits and policies. Our risk
    management committee, comprised of corporate and business unit
    officers, is responsible for establishing and enforcing our
    nonregulated risk management policies and procedures.

Under our risk management policies, we seek to match our
    financial instrument positions to our physical storage positions
    as well as our expected current and future sales and purchase
    obligations to maintain no open positions at the end of each
    trading day. The determination of our net open position as of
    any day, however, requires us to make assumptions as to future
    circumstances, including the use of gas by our customers in
    relation to our anticipated storage and market positions.
    Because the price risk associated with any net open position at
    the end of each day may increase if the assumptions are not
    realized, we review these assumptions as part of our daily
    monitoring activities. We can also be affected by intraday
    fluctuations of gas prices, since the price of natural gas
    purchased or sold for future delivery earlier in the day may not
    be hedged until later in the day. At times, limited net open
    positions related to our existing and anticipated commitments
    may occur. At the close of business on September 30, 2009,
    AEH had a net open position (including existing storage) of
    0.4 Bcf.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management Activities

Currently, we are not managing interest rate risk with financial
    instruments. However, in prior years, we periodically managed
    interest rate risk by entering into Treasury lock agreements to
    fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated
    with anticipated financings.

In fiscal 2004, we entered into four Treasury lock agreements to
    fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost of
    financing associated with the-then anticipated issuance of
    $875 million of long-term debt issued in October 2004 in
    connection with the permanent financing for our TXU Gas
    acquisition. These Treasury lock agreements were settled in
    October 2004 with a net $43.8 million payment to the
    counterparties.

In March 2007, we entered into a Treasury lock agreement to fix
    the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated
    with $100 million of our $250 million
    6.35% Senior Notes issued in June 2007. This Treasury lock
    agreement was settled in June 2007, which resulted in the
    receipt of $2.9 million from the counterparties.

In March 2009, we entered into a Treasury lock agreement to fix
    the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated
    with our $450 million 8.50% senior notes (the Senior
    Notes Offering) issued on March 23, 2009. The Senior Notes
    Offering is discussed in Note 6. We designated this
    Treasury lock as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated
    transaction. This Treasury lock agreement was settled on
    March 23, 2009 with the receipt of $1.9 million from
    the counterparty due to an increase in the 10 year Treasury
    rates between inception of the Treasury lock and settlement.

The gains and losses realized upon settlement were recorded as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and
    are being recognized as a component of interest expense over the
    life of the associated notes from the date of settlement.

Impact of
    Financial Instruments on the Income Statement

The following tables present the impact that financial
    instruments had on our consolidated income statement, by
    operating segment, as applicable, for the years ended
    September 30, 2009 and 2008.

Hedge ineffectiveness for our natural gas marketing and pipeline
    storage and other segments is recorded as a component of
    unrealized gross profit and primarily results from differences
    in the location and timing of the derivative instrument and the
    hedged item. Hedge ineffectiveness could materially affect our
    results of operations for the reported period. For the years
    ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 we recognized a gain
    arising from fair value and cash flow hedge ineffectiveness of
    $6.4 million and $46.0 million. Additional information
    regarding ineffectiveness recognized in the income statement is
    included in the tables below.

Basis ineffectiveness arises from natural gas market price
    differences between the locations of the hedged inventory and
    the delivery location specified in the hedge instruments. Timing
    ineffectiveness arises due to changes in the difference between
    the spot price and the futures price, as well as the difference
    between the timing of the settlement of the futures and the
    valuation of the underlying physical commodity. As the commodity
    contract nears the settlement date, spot to forward price
    differences should converge, which should reduce or eliminate
    the impact of this ineffectiveness on revenue.

Fair
    Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative accounting
    literature that defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair
    value measurements. This guidance does not require any new fair
    value measurements; rather it provides guidance on how to
    perform fair value measurements as required or permitted under
    previous accounting pronouncements. We prospectively adopted the
    provisions of this guidance on October 1, 2008 for most of
    the financial assets and liabilities recorded on our balance
    sheet at fair value. Adoption of this guidance for these assets
    and liabilities did not have a material impact on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows. Subsequent to the
    issuance of the guidance related to fair value measurements, the
    FASB provided a one-year deferral for nonrecurring fair value
    measurements associated with our nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities. Under this partial deferral, the guidance related
    to fair value measurements will not be effective until
    October 1, 2009 for fair value measurements for the
    following:

•

Asset retirement obligations

•

Most nonfinancial assets and liabilities that may be acquired in
    a business combination

•

Impairment analyses performed for nonfinancial assets

We believe the adoption of the FASB’s fair value guidance
    for the reporting of these nonfinancial assets and liabilities
    will not have a material impact on our financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

Fair value measurements also apply to the valuation of our
    pension and post-retirement plan assets. The adoption of the
    authoritative accounting literature published by the FASB in
    September 2006 did not affect these valuations because pension
    and post-retirement assets were specifically excluded from its
    prescribed disclosure provisions. Accordingly, these plan assets
    are not included in the tabular disclosures below. However, in
    December 2008, the FASB issued additional guidance, which will,
    among other things, require similar disclosure about fair value
    measurements for our pension plan assets. This guidance will
    impact our annual disclosure requirements beginning in fiscal
    2010.

The classification of our fair value measurements requires

This column reflects adjustments to our gross financial

    under our master netting agreements and the relevant
    authoritative accounting literature. In addition, as of
    September 30, 2009, we had $11.7 million of cash held
    in margin accounts to collateralize certain financial
    instruments which has been reflected as a financial instrument
    asset.

Our pipeline, storage and other segment uses financial

Other
    Fair Value Measures

In addition to the financial instruments above, we have several
    financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities subject to
    fair value measures. These financial assets and liabilities
    include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
    payable and debt. The nonfinancial assets and liabilities
    include asset retirement obligations and pension and
    post-retirement plan assets. As noted above, fair value
    disclosures for asset retirement obligations and pension and
    post-retirement plan assets are not currently effective for us.
    We record cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
    accounts payable and debt at carrying value. For cash and cash
    equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, we
    consider carrying value to materially approximate fair value due
    to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.

On March 26, 2009, we closed our Senior Notes Offering. The
    effective interest rate on these notes is 8.69 percent,
    after giving effect to the settlement of the $450 million
    Treasury lock discussed in Note 4. Most of the net proceeds
    of approximately $446 million were used to redeem our
    $400 million 4.00% unsecured senior notes on April 30,
    2009, prior to their October 2009 maturity. In connection with
    the repayment of the $400 million 4.00% unsecured senior
    notes, we paid a $6.6 million call premium in accordance
    with the terms of the senior notes and accrued interest of
    approximately $0.6 million. The remaining net proceeds were
    used for general corporate purposes.

Short-term
    debt

Our short-term borrowing requirements are affected by the
    seasonal nature of the natural gas business. Changes in the
    price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to
    supply our customers’ needs

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

could significantly affect our borrowing requirements. Our
    short-term borrowings typically reach their highest levels in
    the winter months.

We finance our short-term borrowing requirements through a
    combination of a $566.7 million commercial paper program
    and four committed revolving credit facilities with third-party
    lenders that provide approximately $1.3 billion of working
    capital funding. At September 30, 2009, there was
    $72.6 million outstanding under our commercial paper
    program. At September 30, 2008, there was
    $350.5 million of short-term debt outstanding, comprised of
    $330.5 million outstanding under our bank credit facilities
    and $20.0 million outstanding under our commercial paper
    program. As of September 30, 2009, our commercial paper had
    maturities of one day with an interest rate of
    0.25 percent. We also use intercompany credit facilities to
    supplement the funding provided by these third-party committed
    credit facilities. These facilities are described in greater
    detail below.

Regulated
    Operations

We fund our regulated operations as needed primarily through a
    $566.7 million commercial paper program and three committed
    revolving credit facilities with third-party lenders that
    provide approximately $800 million of working capital
    funding. The first facility is a five-year unsecured facility,
    expiring December 2011, that bears interest at a base rate or at
    a LIBOR-based rate for the applicable interest period, plus a
    spread ranging from 0.30 percent to 0.75 percent,
    based on the Company’s credit ratings. This credit facility
    serves as a backup liquidity facility for our commercial paper
    program. At the time this credit facility was established,
    borrowings under this facility were limited to
    $600 million. However, in September 2008, the limit on
    borrowings was effectively reduced to $566.7 million after
    one lender with a 5.55% share of the commitments ceased funding
    under the facility. On March 30, 2009, the credit facility
    was amended to reflect this reduction. At September 30,
    2009, there were no borrowings under this facility, but we had
    $72.6 million of commercial paper outstanding leaving
    $494.1 million available.

The second facility is a $212.5 million unsecured

364-day

facility expiring October 2009, that bears interest at a base
    rate or at a LIBOR-based rate for the applicable interest
    period, plus a spread ranging from 1.25 percent to
    2.50 percent, based on the Company’s credit ratings.
    At September 30, 2009, there were no borrowings outstanding
    under this facility. In October 2009, this facility was renewed
    on substantially the same terms for $200 million, which
    expires October 2010.

The third facility was an $18 million unsecured facility
    that bore interest at a daily negotiated rate, generally based
    on the Federal Funds rate plus a variable margin. This facility
    expired on March 31, 2009 and was replaced with a
    $25 million unsecured facility effective April 1, 2009
    that bears interest at a daily negotiated rate. At
    September 30, 2009, there were no borrowings outstanding
    under this facility.

The availability of funds under these credit facilities is
    subject to conditions specified in the respective credit
    agreements, all of which we currently satisfy. These conditions
    include our compliance with financial covenants and the
    continued accuracy of representations and warranties contained
    in these agreements. We are required by the financial covenants
    in each of these facilities to maintain, at the end of each
    fiscal quarter, a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of
    no greater than 70 percent. At September 30, 2009, our

total-debt-to-total-capitalization

ratio, as defined, was 53 percent. In addition, both the
    interest margin over the Eurodollar rate and the fee that we pay
    on unused amounts under each of these facilities are subject to
    adjustment depending upon our credit ratings.

In addition to these third-party facilities, our regulated
    operations have a $200 million intercompany revolving
    credit facility with AEH. Through December 31, 2008, this
    facility bore interest at the one-month LIBOR rate plus
    0.20 percent. In January 2009, this facility was replaced
    with a new $200 million 364 day-facility that bears
    interest at the lower of (i) the one-month LIBOR rate plus
    0.45 percent or (ii) the marginal borrowing rate
    available to the Company on the date of borrowing. The marginal
    borrowing rate is defined as



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the lower of (i) a rate based upon the lower of the Prime
    Rate or the Eurodollar rate under the five year revolving credit
    facility or (ii) the lowest rate outstanding under the
    commercial paper program. Applicable state regulatory
    commissions have approved the new facility through
    December 31, 2009. There was $86.4 million outstanding
    under this facility at September 30, 2009.

Nonregulated
    Operations

On December 30, 2008, AEM and the participating banks
    amended and restated AEM’s former uncommitted credit
    facility, primarily to convert the $580 million uncommitted
    demand credit facility to a

364-day

$375 million committed revolving credit facility and extend
    it to December 29, 2009. Effective April 1, 2009, the
    borrowing base was increased to $450 million through the
    exercise of an accordion feature in the facility.

The amended facility also adds a swing line loan feature;
    adjusts the interest rate on borrowings as discussed below and
    increases the fees paid to reflect the facility’s
    conversion to a committed facility and current credit market
    conditions. The swing line loan feature allows AEM to borrow, on
    a same day basis, an amount ranging from $17 million to
    $27 million based on the terms of an election within the
    agreement.

AEM uses this facility primarily to issue letters of credit and,
    on a less frequent basis, to borrow funds for gas purchases and
    other working capital needs. At AEM’s option, borrowings
    made under the credit facility are based on a base rate or an
    offshore rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. The base
    rate is a floating rate equal to the higher of:
    (a) 0.50 percent per annum above the latest federal
    funds rate; (b) the per annum rate of interest established
    by BNP Paribas from time to time as its “prime rate”
    or “base rate” for U.S. dollar loans; (c) an
    offshore rate (based on LIBOR with a one-month interest period)
    as in effect from time to time; and (d) the “cost of
    funds” rate based on an average of interest rates reported
    by one or more of the lenders to the administrative agent. The
    offshore rate is a floating rate equal to the higher of
    (a) an offshore rate based upon LIBOR for the applicable
    interest period; and (b) a “cost of funds” rate
    referred to above. In the case of both base rate and offshore
    rate loans, the applicable margin ranges from 2.250 percent
    to 2.625 percent per annum, depending on the excess
    tangible net worth of AEM, as defined in the credit facility.
    This facility is collateralized by substantially all of the
    assets of AEM and is guaranteed by AEH.

At September 30, 2009, there were no borrowings outstanding
    under this credit facility. However, at September 30, 2009,
    AEM letters of credit totaling $19.2 million had been
    issued under the facility, which reduced the amount available by
    a corresponding amount. The amount available under this credit
    facility is also limited by various covenants, including
    covenants based on working capital. Under the most restrictive
    covenant, the amount available to AEM under this credit facility
    was $170.4 million at September 30, 2009.

AEM is required by the financial covenants in this facility to
    maintain a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth that
    does not exceed a maximum of 5 to 1. At September 30, 2009,
    AEM’s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth, as
    defined, was 0.84 to 1. Additionally, AEM must maintain minimum
    levels of net working capital and net worth ranging from
    $75 million to $112.5 million. As defined in the
    financial covenants, at September 30, 2009, AEM’s net
    working capital was $155.9 million and its tangible net
    worth was $168.5 million.

To supplement borrowings under this facility, through
    December 31, 2008, AEM had a $200 million intercompany
    demand credit facility with AEH, which bore interest at the rate
    for AEM’s offshore borrowings under its committed credit
    facility plus 0.75 percent. Amounts outstanding under this
    facility are subordinated to AEM’s committed credit
    facility. This facility was replaced with another
    $200 million

364-day

facility in January 2009 with no material changes to its terms
    except for the rate of interest, which is the greater of
    (i) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 2.00 percent or
    (ii) the rate for AEM’s offshore borrowings under its
    committed credit facility plus 0.75 percent. There were no
    borrowings outstanding under this facility at September 30,
    2009.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Finally, through December 31, 2008, AEH had a
    $200 million intercompany demand credit facility with AEC,
    which bore interest at the rate for AEM’s offshore
    borrowings under its committed credit facility plus
    0.75 percent. This facility was replaced with another
    $200 million

364-day

facility in January 2009 with no material changes to its terms
    except for the rate of interest, which is the greater of
    (i) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 2.00 percent or
    (ii) the rate for AEM’s offshore borrowings under its
    committed credit facility plus 0.75 percent. Applicable
    state regulatory commissions have approved the new facility
    through December 31, 2009. There were no borrowings
    outstanding under this facility at September 30, 2009.

Shelf
    Registration

On March 23, 2009, we filed a registration statement with
    the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue, from time
    to time, up to $900 million in common stock

and/or

debt
    securities available for issuance, including approximately
    $450 million of capacity carried over from our prior shelf
    registration statement filed with the SEC in December 2006.

As of September 30, 2009, we had approximately
    $450 million of availability remaining under the
    registration statement after completing our Senior Notes
    Offering. However, due to certain restrictions placed by one
    state regulatory commission on our ability to issue securities
    under the registration statement, we now have remaining and
    available for issuance a total of approximately
    $200 million of equity securities and $250 million of
    subordinated debt securities.

Debt
    Covenants

In addition to the financial covenants described above, our debt
    instruments contain various covenants that are usual and
    customary for debt instruments of these types.

Additionally, our public debt indentures relating to our senior
    notes and debentures, as well as our revolving credit
    agreements, each contain a default provision that is triggered
    if outstanding indebtedness arising out of any other credit
    agreements in amounts ranging from in excess of $15 million
    to in excess of $100 million becomes due by acceleration or
    is not paid at maturity.

Further, AEM’s credit agreement contains a cross-default
    provision whereby AEM would be in default if it defaults on
    other indebtedness, as defined, by at least $250 thousand in the
    aggregate.

Finally, AEM’s credit agreement contains a provision that
    would limit the amount of credit available if Atmos Energy were
    downgraded below an S&P rating of BBB and a Moody’s
    rating of Baa2. We have no other triggering events in our debt
    instruments that are tied to changes in specified credit ratings
    or stock price, nor have we entered into any transactions that
    would require us to issue equity, based on our credit rating or
    other triggering events.

We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of
    September 30, 2009. If we were unable to comply with our
    debt covenants, we would likely be required to repay our
    outstanding balances on demand, provide additional collateral or
    take other corrective actions.

Stock and
    Other Compensation Plans

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

Total stock-based compensation expense was $14.5 million,
    $14.0 million and $11.9 million for the fiscal years
    ended September 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, primarily related
    to restricted stock costs.

    Long-Term Incentive Plan

In August 1998, the Board of Directors approved and adopted the
    1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which became effective in
    October 1998 after approval by our shareholders. The LTIP is a
    comprehensive, long-term incentive compensation plan providing
    for discretionary awards of incentive stock options,
    non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, bonus
    stock, time-lapse restricted stock, time-lapse restricted stock
    units, performance-based restricted stock units and stock units
    to certain employees and non-employee directors of the Company
    and our subsidiaries. The objectives of this plan include
    attracting and retaining the best personnel, providing for
    additional performance incentives and promoting our success by
    providing employees with the opportunity to acquire common stock.

We are authorized to grant awards for up to a maximum of
    6.5 million shares of common stock under this plan subject
    to certain adjustment provisions. As of September 30, 2009,
    non-qualified stock options, bonus stock, time-lapse restricted
    stock, time-lapse restricted stock units, performance-based
    restricted stock units and stock units had been issued under
    this plan, and 1,473,531 shares were available for future
    issuance. The option price of the stock options issued under
    this plan is equal to the market price of our stock at the date
    of grant. These stock options expire 10 years from the date
    of the grant and vest annually over a service period ranging
    from one to three years. However, no stock options have been
    granted under this plan since fiscal 2003, except for a limited
    number of options that were converted from bonuses paid under
    our Annual Incentive Plan, the last of which occurred in fiscal
    2006.

Restricted
    Stock Plans

As noted above, the LTIP provides for discretionary awards of
    restricted stock to help attract, retain and reward employees of
    Atmos Energy and its subsidiaries. Certain of these awards vest
    based upon the passage of time and other awards vest based upon
    the passage of time and the achievement of specified performance
    targets. The associated expense is recognized ratably over the
    vesting period. The following summarizes

Other
    Plans

Direct
    Stock Purchase Plan

We maintain a Direct Stock Purchase Plan, open to all investors,
    which allows participants to have all or part of their cash
    dividends paid quarterly in additional shares of our common
    stock. The minimum initial investment required to join the plan
    is $1,250. Direct Stock Purchase Plan participants may purchase
    additional shares of our common stock as often as weekly with
    voluntary cash payments of at least $25, up to an annual maximum
    of $100,000.

Outside
    Directors Stock-For-Fee Plan

In November 1994, the Board adopted the Outside Directors
    Stock-for-Fee Plan which was approved by our shareholders in
    February 1995 and was amended and restated in November 1997. The
    plan permits non-employee directors to receive all or part of
    their annual retainer and meeting fees in stock rather than in
    cash.

Equity
    Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
    Directors

In November 1998, the Board of Directors adopted the Equity
    Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
    Directors which was approved by our shareholders in February
    1999. This plan amended the Atmos Energy Corporation Deferred
    Compensation Plan for Outside Directors adopted by the Company
    in May 1990 and replaced the pension payable under our
    Retirement Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The plan provides
    non-employee directors of Atmos Energy with the opportunity to
    defer receipt, until retirement, of compensation for services
    rendered to the Company, invest deferred compensation into
    either a cash account or a stock account and to receive an
    annual grant of share units for each year of service on the
    Board.

Other
    Discretionary Compensation Plans

We adopted the Variable Pay Plan in fiscal 1999 for our
    regulated segments’ employees to give each employee an
    opportunity to share in our financial success based on the
    achievement of key performance measures considered critical to
    achieving business objectives for a given year and has minimum
    and maximum thresholds. The plan must meet the minimum threshold
    for the plan to be funded and distributed to employees. These
    performance measures may include earnings growth objectives,
    improved cash flow objectives or crucial customer satisfaction
    and safety results. We monitor progress towards the achievement
    of the performance measures throughout the year and record
    accruals based upon the expected payout using the best estimates
    available at the time the accrual is recorded. During the last
    several fiscal years, we have used earnings per share as our
    sole performance measure.

We adopted our Annual Incentive Plan in October 2001 to give the
    employees in our nonregulated segments an opportunity to share
    in the success of the nonregulated operations. The plan is based
    upon the net earnings of the nonregulated operations and has
    minimum and maximum thresholds. The plan must meet the minimum
    threshold in order for the plan to be funded and distributed to
    employees. We monitor the progress toward the achievement of the
    thresholds throughout the year and record accruals based upon
    the expected payout using the best estimates available at the
    time the accrual is recorded.

Retirement
    and Post-Retirement Employee Benefit Plans

We have both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit
    plans that together cover substantially all of our employees. We
    also maintain post-retirement plans that provide health care
    benefits to retired employees. Finally, we sponsor defined
    contribution plans which cover substantially all employees.
    These plans are discussed in further detail below.

Effective September 30, 2007, we adopted the guidance
    issued by the FASB in September 2006 related to changes in the
    accounting rules for defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement plans. The new standard made a significant change
    to the existing rules by requiring recognition in the balance
    sheet of the overfunded or underfunded positions of defined
    benefit pension and other postretirement plans, along with a
    corresponding noncash, after-tax adjustment to
    stockholders’ equity.

Additionally, this standard requires that our measurement date
    correspond to the fiscal year end balance sheet date. Effective
    October 1, 2008, the Company adopted the measurement date
    requirement using the remeasurement approach. Under this
    approach, the Company remeasured its projected benefit
    obligation, fair value of plan assets and its fiscal
    2009 net periodic cost. In accordance with the transition
    rules of the new standard, the impact of changing the
    measurement date decreased retained earnings by
    $7.8 million, net of tax, decreased the unrecognized
    actuarial loss by $9.0 million and increased our
    postretirement liabilities by $3.5 million as of
    October 1, 2008.

As a rate regulated entity, we generally recover our pension
    costs in our rates over a period of up to 15 years.
    Therefore, the decrease in the unrecognized actuarial loss that
    would have been recorded as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive loss, net of tax, was recorded as a reduction to a
    regulatory asset as a component of deferred charges and other
    assets in fiscal 2009. The change in the measurement date did
    not materially impact the level of net periodic pension cost we
    recorded in fiscal 2009.

    Pension Plans

As of September 30, 2009, we maintained two defined benefit
    plans: the Atmos Energy Corporation Pension Account Plan (the
    Plan) and the Atmos Energy Corporation Retirement Plan for
    Mississippi Valley Gas Union Employees (the Union Plan)
    (collectively referred to as the Plans). The assets of the Plans
    are held within the Atmos Energy Corporation Master Retirement
    Trust (the Master Trust).

The Plan is a cash balance pension plan that was established
    effective January 1999 and covers substantially all employees of
    Atmos Energy’s regulated operations. Opening account
    balances were established for participants as of January 1999
    equal to the present value of their respective accrued benefits
    under the pension plans which were previously in effect as of
    December 31, 1998. The Plan credits an allocation to each
    participant’s account at the end of each year according to
    a formula based on the participant’s age, service and total
    pay (excluding incentive pay).

The Plan also provides for an additional annual allocation based
    upon a participant’s age as of January 1, 1999 for
    those participants who were participants in the prior pension
    plans. The Plan credited this additional allocation each year
    through December 31, 2008. In addition, at the end of each
    year, a participant’s account will be credited with
    interest on the employee’s prior year account balance. A
    special grandfather benefit also applied through
    December 31, 2008, for participants who were at least
    age 50 as of January 1, 1999, and who were
    participants in one of the prior plans on December 31,
    1998. Participants are fully vested in their account balances
    after three years of service and may choose to receive their
    account balances as a lump sum or an annuity.

The Union Plan is a defined benefit plan that covers
    substantially all full-time union employees in our Mississippi
    Division. Under this plan, benefits are based upon years of
    benefit service and average final earnings. Participants vest in
    the plan after five years and will receive their benefit in an
    annuity.

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an
    amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, including the funding
    requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA).
    However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time
    to time as

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not
    only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for
    those expected to be earned in the future.

During fiscal 2009, we contributed $21.0 million in cash to
    the Plans to achieve a desired level of funding for the 2008
    plan year while maximizing the tax deductibility of this
    payment. In fiscal 2008, we voluntarily contributed
    $2.3 million to the Union Plan, which achieved the desired
    level of funding for this plan for the 2007 plan year. During
    fiscal 2007, we did not make any contributions to the Plans.
    Based upon market conditions subsequent to September 30,
    2009, the current funded position of the plans and the new
    funding requirements under the PPA, we believe it is reasonably
    possible that we will be required to contribute to the Plans in
    fiscal 2010. Further, we will consider whether an additional
    voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain PPA
    funding thresholds. However, we cannot anticipate with certainty
    whether such contributions will be made and the amount of such
    contributions.

We manage the Master Trust’s assets with the objective of
    achieving a rate of return net of inflation of approximately
    four percent per year. We make investment decisions and evaluate
    performance on a medium term horizon of at least three to five
    years. We also consider our current financial status when making
    recommendations and decisions regarding the Master Trust’s
    assets. Finally, we strive to ensure the Master Trust’s
    assets are appropriately invested to maintain an acceptable
    level of risk and meet the Master Trust’s long-term asset
    investment policy adopted by the Board of Directors.

To achieve these objectives, we invest the Master Trust’s
    assets in equity securities, fixed income securities, interests
    in commingled pension trust funds, other investment assets and
    cash and cash equivalents. Investments in equity securities are
    diversified among the market’s various subsectors in an
    effort to diversify risk and maximize returns. Fixed income
    securities are invested in investment grade securities. Cash
    equivalents are invested in securities that either are short
    term (less than 180 days) or readily convertible to cash
    with modest risk.

    the Master Trust as of September 30, 2009 and 2008.

At September 30, 2009 and 2008, the Plan held
    1,169,700 shares of our common stock, which represented
    10.9 percent and 10.2 percent of total Master Trust
    assets. These shares generated dividend income for the Plan of
    approximately $1.5 million during fiscal 2009 and 2008.

Our employee pension plan expenses and liabilities are
    determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous
    assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan
    assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets and
    assumed discount rates and demographic data. We review the
    estimates and assumptions underlying our employee pension plans
    annually based upon a September 30 measurement date. Prior to
    October 1, 2008, the estimates and assumptions were
    determined based on a June 30 measurement date. As described
    above, the adoption of new accounting guidance in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States necessitated a change in our measurement date during
    fiscal 2009. The development of our assumptions is fully
    described in our significant accounting policies in Note 2.
    The actuarial assumptions used to determine the pension
    liability for the Plans were determined as of

Supplemental
    Executive Benefits Plans

We have a nonqualified Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan
    which provides additional pension, disability and death benefits
    to our officers, division presidents and certain other employees
    of the Company who were employed on or before August 12,
    1998. In addition, in August 1998, we adopted the Supplemental
    Executive Retirement Plan (formerly known as the
    Performance-Based Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan), which
    covers all employees who become officers or division presidents
    after August 12, 1998 or any other employees selected by
    our Board of Directors at its discretion.

During the last fiscal year, the Company has worked with our
    independent compensation consultant to develop and implement a
    new Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) design for any
    new executives or current employees selected for participation
    in the SERP arrangement on a prospective basis. Only those
    executives who are currently members of our Management Committee
    as well as those individuals who may be selected in the future
    to serve on the Management Committee, plus those executives who
    are active SERP participants as of August 5, 2009, will
    continue to participate in the current SERP arrangement until
    their respective retirement dates. The current SERP arrangement
    is a 60 percent of covered compensation defined benefit
    arrangement in which benefits from the underlying qualified
    defined benefit plan are an offset to the SERP benefit. The new
    SERP arrangement for new participants in the Company’s
    executive retirement program is a modified defined benefit
    approach in which the Company will contribute to a nominal
    account for each participant, an amount equal to ten percent of
    each participant’s base salary and bonus following the
    participant’s completion of a plan year of service. Other
    provisions of the plan mirror that of the Company’s
    underlying qualified plan, the Pension Account Plan. At this
    time, only one employee has been selected for participation in
    the new SERP arrangement.

Similar to our employee pension plans, we review the estimates
    and assumptions underlying our supplemental executive benefit
    plans annually based upon a September 30 measurement date using
    the same techniques as our employee pension plans. The actuarial
    assumptions used to determine the pension liability for the
    supplemental plans were determined as of September 30, 2009
    and June 30, 2008 and the actuarial assumptions used to
    determine the net periodic pension cost for the supplemental
    plans were determined as of September 30, 2008,
    June 30, 2007 and 2006. These assumptions are presented in

Postretirement
    Benefits

We sponsor the Retiree Medical Plan for Retirees and Disabled
    Employees of Atmos Energy Corporation (the Atmos Retiree Medical
    Plan). This plan provides medical and prescription drug
    protection to all qualified participants based on their date of
    retirement. The Atmos Retiree Medical Plan provides different
    levels of benefits depending on the level of coverage chosen by
    the participants and the terms of predecessor plans; however, we
    generally pay 80 percent of the projected net claims and
    administrative costs and participants pay the remaining
    20 percent of this cost.

As of September 30, 2009, the Board of Directors approved a
    change to the cost sharing methodology for employees who had not
    met the participation requirements by that date for the Atmos
    Retiree Medical Plan. Starting in five years, on January 1,
    2015, the contribution rates that will apply to all
    non-grandfathered participants will be determined using a new
    cost sharing methodology by which Atmos Energy will limit its
    contribution to a three percent cost increase in claims and
    administrative costs each year. If medical costs covered by the
    Atmos Retiree Medical Plan increase more than three percent
    annually, participants will be responsible for the additional
    cost.

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an
    amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. However, additional
    voluntary contributions are made annually as considered
    necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for
    benefits attributed to service to date but also for those
    expected to be earned in the future. We expect to contribute
    $12.2 million to our postretirement benefits plan during
    fiscal 2010.

We maintain a formal investment policy with respect to the
    assets in our postretirement benefits plan to ensure the assets
    funding the postretirement benefit plan are appropriately
    invested to maintain an acceptable level of risk. We also
    consider our current financial status when making
    recommendations and decisions regarding the postretirement
    benefits plan.

We currently invest the assets funding our postretirement
    benefit plan in diversified investment funds which consist of
    common stocks, preferred stocks and fixed income securities. The
    diversified investment funds may invest up to 75 percent of
    assets in common stocks and convertible securities. The

We are currently recovering other postretirement benefits costs
    through our regulated rates under accrual accounting as
    prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States in substantially all of our service areas. Other
    postretirement benefits costs have been specifically addressed
    in rate orders in each jurisdiction served by our
    Kentucky/Mid-States Division and our Mississippi Division or
    have been included in a rate case and not disallowed. Management
    believes that this accounting method is appropriate and will
    continue to seek rate recovery of accrual-based expenses in its
    ratemaking jurisdictions that have not yet approved the recovery
    of these expenses.

Estimated
    Future Benefit Payments

The following benefit payments paid by us, retirees and
    prescription drug subsidy payments for our postretirement

Defined
    Contribution Plans

As of September 30, 2009, we maintained three defined
    contribution benefit plans: the Atmos Energy Corporation
    Retirement Savings Plan and Trust (the Retirement Savings Plan),
    the Atmos Energy Corporation Savings Plan for MVG Union
    Employees (the Union 401K Plan) and the Atmos Energy Marketing,
    LLC 401K Profit-Sharing Plan (the AEM 401K Profit-Sharing Plan).

The Retirement Savings Plan covers substantially all employees
    in our regulated operations and is subject to the provisions of
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Effective
    January 1, 2007, employees automatically became
    participants of the Retirement Savings Plan on the date of
    employment. Participants may elect a salary reduction ranging
    from a minimum of one percent up to a maximum of 65 percent
    of eligible compensation, as defined by the Plan, not to exceed
    the maximum allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. New
    participants are automatically enrolled in the Plan at a salary
    reduction amount of four percent of eligible compensation, from
    which they may opt out. We match 100 percent of a
    participant’s contributions, limited to four percent of the
    participant’s salary, in our common stock. However,
    participants have the option to immediately transfer this
    matching contribution into other funds held within the plan.
    Participants are eligible to receive matching contributions
    after completing one year of service. Participants are also
    permitted to take out loans against their accounts subject to
    certain restrictions.

The Union 401K Plan covers substantially all Mississippi
    Division employees who are members of the International Chemical
    Workers Union Council, United Food and Commercial Workers Union
    International (the Union) and is subject to the provisions of
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees of
    the Union automatically become participants of the Union 401K
    plan on the date of union membership. We match 50 percent
    of a participant’s contribution in cash, limited to six
    percent of the participant’s eligible contribution.
    Participants are also permitted to take out loans against their
    accounts subject to certain restrictions.

Matching contributions to the Retirement Savings Plan and the
    Union 401K Plan are expensed as incurred and amounted to
    $9.3 million, $8.9 million, and $8.3 million for
    fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007. The Board of Directors may
    also approve discretionary contributions, subject to the
    provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and applicable
    regulations of the Internal Revenue Service. No discretionary
    contributions were made for fiscal years 2009, 2008 or 2007. At
    September 30, 2009 and 2008, the Retirement Savings Plan
    held 3.8 percent and 3.4 percent of our outstanding
    common stock.

The AEM 401K Profit-Sharing Plan covers substantially all AEM
    employees and is subject to the provisions of
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participants
    may elect a salary reduction ranging from a minimum of one
    percent up to a maximum of 65 percent of eligible
    compensation, as defined by the Plan, not to exceed the maximum
    allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company may elect
    to make safe harbor contributions up to three percent of the
    employee’s salary which vest immediately. The Company may
    also make discretionary profit sharing contributions to the AEM
    401K Profit-Sharing Plan. Participants become fully vested in
    the discretionary profit-sharing contributions after three years
    of service. Participants are also permitted to take out loans
    against their accounts subject to certain restrictions.
    Discretionary contributions to the AEM 401K Profit-Sharing Plan
    are expensed as incurred and amounted to $0.7 million,
    $0.5 million and $0.8 million for fiscal years 2009,
    2008 and 2007.

As of September 30, 2009 and 2008, we had recorded
    liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions totaling
    $6.7 million. The realization of all of these tax benefits
    would reduce our income tax expense by approximately
    $6.7 million. There were no changes in unrecognized tax
    benefits as a result of tax positions taken during the current
    or prior years or as a result of settlements with taxing
    authorities for the year ended September 30, 2009.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction
    as well as in various states where we have operations. We have

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Litigation

Colorado-Kansas
    Division

We are a defendant in a lawsuit originally filed by Quinque
    Operating Company, Tom Boles and Robert Ditto in September 1999
    in the District Court of Stevens County, Kansas against more
    than 200 companies in the natural gas industry. The
    plaintiffs, who purport to represent a class of royalty owners,
    allege that the defendants have underpaid royalties on gas taken
    from wells situated on non-federal and non-Indian lands in
    Kansas, predicated upon allegations that the defendants’
    gas measurements were inaccurate. The plaintiffs have not
    specifically alleged an amount of damages. We are also a
    defendant, along with over 50 other companies in the natural gas
    industry, in another proposed class action lawsuit filed in the
    same court by Will Price, Tom Boles and The Cooper Clarke
    Foundation in May 2003 involving similar allegations. In
    September 2009, the court ruled that the plaintiffs in both
    cases had not provided sufficient evidence to meet the standards
    of a class action and denied class action status to each of the
    plaintiffs in both cases. We believe that the plaintiffs’
    claims in both cases are lacking in merit and we intend to
    vigorously defend these actions. While the results cannot be
    predicted with certainty, we believe the final outcome of such
    litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We are
    also a defendant in another lawsuit entitled

In Re Natural
    Gas Royalties Qui Tam Litigation

, involving similar
    allegations filed in June 1997 in the United States District
    Court for the District of Colorado, which was later transferred
    to the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming,
    where it was consolidated with approximately 50 additional
    lawsuits in October 1999. In October 2006, the District Court
    granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss this lawsuit for
    lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The plaintiffs appealed
    this dismissal order on which oral arguments were heard by the
    United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in
    September 2008. In May 2009, the Tenth Circuit denied such
    appeal and motion for rehearing. In August 2009, the plaintiffs
    filed for a Writ of Certiorari with the Supreme Court of the
    United States appealing the Tenth Circuit’s order
    dismissing the lawsuit, which the Supreme Court denied on
    October 5, 2009.

We are a party to other litigation and claims that have arisen
    in the ordinary course of our business. While the results of
    such litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty,
    we believe the final outcome of such litigation and claims will
    not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
    results of operations or cash flows.

Environmental
    Matters

Former
    Manufactured Gas Plant Sites

We are the owner or previous owner of former manufactured gas
    plant sites in Johnson City and Bristol, Tennessee, Keokuk,
    Iowa, Hannibal, Missouri and Owensboro, Kentucky, which were
    used to supply gas prior to the availability of natural gas. The
    gas manufacturing process resulted in certain byproducts and
    residual materials, including coal tar. The manufacturing
    process used by our predecessors was an acceptable and
    satisfactory process at the time such operations were being
    conducted. Under current environmental protection laws and
    regulations, we may be responsible for response actions with
    respect to such materials if response

actions are necessary. We have taken removal actions with
    respect to the sites that have been approved by the applicable
    regulatory authorities in Tennessee, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky
    and the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

We are a party to other environmental matters and claims that
    have arisen in the ordinary course of our business. While the
    ultimate results of response actions to these environmental
    matters and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we
    believe the final outcome of such response actions will not have
    a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations or cash flows because we believe that the
    expenditures related to such response actions will either be
    recovered through rates, shared with other parties or are
    adequately covered by insurance.

Purchase
    Commitments

AEM has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural
    gas under contracts indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed
    price contracts. At September 30, 2009, AEM was committed
    to purchase 72.6 Bcf within one year, 19.4 Bcf within
    one to three years and 2.2 Bcf after three years under
    indexed contracts. AEM is committed to purchase 2.9 Bcf
    within one year under fixed price contracts with prices ranging
    from $2.95 to $7.68 per Mcf. Purchases under these contracts
    totaled $1,484.5 million, $3,075.0 million and
    $2,065.1 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Our natural gas distribution divisions, except for our Mid-Tex
    Division, maintain supply contracts with several vendors that
    generally cover a period of up to one year. Commitments for
    estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts
    on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices.
    Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as
    necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the
    individual contract.

Our Mid-Tex Division maintains long-term supply contracts to
    ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service
    area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market
    and fixed prices. The estimated commitments under these
    contracts as of September 30, 2009 are as follows (in

Other
    Contingencies

In December 2007, the Company received data requests from the
    Division of Investigations of the Office of Enforcement of the
    Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the
    “Commission”) in connection with its investigation
    into possible violations of the Commission’s posting and
    competitive bidding regulations for pre-arranged released firm
    capacity on natural gas pipelines. We have responded timely to
    data requests received from the Commission and are fully
    cooperating with the Commission during this investigation.

The Commission agreed to allow the Company to conduct our own
    internal investigation into compliance with the
    Commission’s rules. We have completed the investigation and
    have provided a report on the results of the investigation to
    the Commission, which report is currently under review by the
    Commission. We currently are unable to predict the final outcome
    of this investigation or the potential impact it could have on
    our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2008, the Texas Railroad Commission issued a final
    rule requiring the replacement of known compression couplings at
    pre-bent gas meter risers by November 2009. Compliance with this
    rule has not had a significant impact on our West Texas Division
    but has required us to spend significant amounts of capital in
    our Mid-Tex Division. As of September 30, 2009 we had
    substantially completed our pre-bent riser replacement program
    in the Mid-Tex Division.

Leases

Leasing
    Operations

A subsidiary of AEH has constructed electric peaking
    power-generating plants and associated facilities and entered
    into agreements to either lease or sell these plants. We
    completed a sales-type lease transaction for one distributed
    electric generation plant in 2001 and a second sales-type lease
    transaction in 2003. In connection with these lease
    transactions, as of September 30, 2009 and 2008, we had
    receivables of $10.8 million and $13.8 million and
    recognized income of $1.2 million, $1.3 million and
    $1.5 million for

Capital
    and Operating Leases

We have entered into non-cancelable operating leases for office
    and warehouse space used in our operations. The remaining lease
    terms range from one to 22 years and generally provide for
    the payment of taxes, insurance and maintenance by the lessee.
    Renewal options exist for certain of these leases. We have also
    entered into capital leases for division offices and operating
    facilities. Property, plant and equipment included amounts for
    capital leases of $1.3 million at both September 30,
    2009 and 2008. Accumulated depreciation for these capital leases
    totaled $0.8 million and $0.7 million at
    September 30, 2009 and 2008. Depreciation expense for these
    assets is included in consolidated depreciation expense on the
    consolidated statement of income.

The related future minimum lease payments at September 30,
    2009 were as follows:

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to us if a customer
    fails to perform its contractual obligations. We engage in
    transactions for the purchase and sale of products and services
    with major companies in the energy industry and with industrial,
    commercial, residential and municipal energy consumers. These
    transactions principally occur in the southern and midwestern
    regions of the United States. We believe that this geographic



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

concentration does not contribute significantly to our overall
    exposure to credit risk. Credit risk associated with trade
    accounts receivable for the natural gas distribution segment is
    mitigated by the large number of individual customers and
    diversity in our customer base. The credit risk for our other
    segments is not significant.

Customer diversification also helps mitigate AEM’s exposure
    to credit risk. AEM maintains credit policies with respect to
    its counterparties that it believes minimizes overall credit
    risk. Where appropriate, such policies include the evaluation of
    a prospective counterparty’s financial condition,
    collateral requirements, primarily consisting of letters of
    credit, and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate
    the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty.
    AEM also monitors the financial condition of existing
    counterparties on an ongoing basis. Customers not meeting
    minimum standards are required to provide adequate assurance of
    financial performance.

AEM maintains a provision for credit losses based upon factors
    surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends,
    consideration of the current credit environment and other
    information. We believe, based on our credit policies and our
    provisions for credit losses as of September 30, 2009, that
    our financial position, results of operations and cash flows
    will not be materially affected as a result of nonperformance by
    any single counterparty.

AEM’s estimated credit exposure is monitored in terms of
    the percentage of its customers, including affiliate customers
    that are rated as investment grade versus non-investment grade.
    Credit exposure is defined as the total of (1) accounts
    receivable, (2) delivered, but unbilled physical sales and

(3) mark-to-market

exposure for sales and purchases. Investment grade
    determinations are set internally by AEM’s credit
    department, but are primarily based on external ratings provided
    by Moody’s Investors Service Inc. (Moody’s)

and/or

Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P). For
    non-rated entities, the default rating for municipalities is
    investment grade, while the default rating for non-guaranteed
    industrials and commercials is non-investment grade. The
    following table shows the percentages related to the investment
    ratings as of September 30, 2009 and 2008.

The following table presents our financial instrument
    counterparty credit exposure by operating segment based upon the
    unrealized fair value of our financial instruments that
    represent assets as of September 30, 2009. Investment grade
    counterparties have minimum credit ratings of BBB-, assigned by
    S&P; or Baa3, assigned by Moody’s. Non-investment
    grade counterparties are composed of counterparties that are
    below investment grade or that have not been assigned an
    internal investment grade rating due to the short-term nature of
    the contracts associated with that counterparty. This category
    is composed of numerous smaller counterparties, none of which is
    individually significant.

Segment
    Information

Atmos Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries are engaged
    primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution,
    transmission and storage business as well as other nonregulated
    businesses. We distribute natural gas through sales and
    transportation arrangements to over 3 million residential,
    commercial, public authority and industrial customers through
    our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions, which
    cover service areas located in 12 states. In addition, we
    transport natural gas for others through our distribution system.

Through our nonregulated businesses, we primarily provide
    natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities,
    other local distribution companies and industrial customers
    primarily in the Midwest and Southeast. Additionally, we provide
    natural gas transportation and storage services to certain of
    our natural gas distribution operations and to third parties.

We operate the Company through the following four segments:

•

The

natural gas distribution segment

, which includes our
    regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations.

•

The

regulated transmission and storage segment

, which
    includes the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the
    Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division.

•

The

natural gas marketing segment

, which includes a
    variety of nonregulated natural gas management services.

•

The

pipeline, storage and other segment

, which includes
    our nonregulated natural gas transmission and storage services.

Our determination of reportable segments considers the strategic
    operating units under which we manage sales of various products
    and services to customers in differing regulatory environments.
    Although our natural gas distribution segment operations are
    geographically dispersed, they are reported as a single segment
    as each natural gas distribution division has similar economic
    characteristics. The accounting policies of the segments are the
    same as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies. We evaluate performance based on net income or loss of
    the respective operating units. Interest expense is allocated
    pro rata to each segment based upon our net investment in each
    segment. Income taxes are allocated to each segment as if each
    segment’s taxes were calculated on a separate return basis.

Controls
    and Procedures.

Management’s
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer, of the
    effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures, as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange
    Act). Based on this evaluation, the Company’s principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded
    that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective as of September 30, 2009 to provide reasonable
    assurance that information required to be disclosed by us,
    including our consolidated entities, in the reports that we file
    or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by
    the SEC’s rules and forms, including a reasonable level of
    assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated
    to our management, including our principal executive and
    principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f),

in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting based on the framework in

Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework

issued by COSO and applicable
    Securities and Exchange Commission rules, our management
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of September 30, 2009, in providing reasonable
    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
    the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Ernst & Young LLP has issued its report on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Atmos Energy Corporation

We have audited Atmos Energy Corporation’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of September 30, 2009, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Atmos Energy
    Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Atmos Energy Corporation maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of September 30, 2009, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2009 and
    2008, and the related statements of income, stockholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended September 30, 2009 of Atmos Energy Corporation and
    our report dated November 16, 2009 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.
