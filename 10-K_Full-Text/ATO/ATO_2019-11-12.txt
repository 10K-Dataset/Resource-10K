GLOSSARY OF KEY TERMS



PART I

The terms “we,” “our,” “us”, “Atmos Energy” and the “Company” refer to Atmos Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context suggests otherwise.

ITEM 1.

Business.

Overview and Strategy

Atmos Energy Corporation, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and incorporated in Texas and Virginia, is one of the country’s largest natural-gas-only distributors based on number of customers.  We deliver safe, clean, reliable, efficient, affordable and abundant natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to over three million residential, commercial, public authority and industrial customers in eight states located primarily in the South.  We also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in Texas based on miles of pipe.

Atmos Energy's vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services. We intend to achieve this vision by:

•

operating our business exceptionally well

•

investing in our people and infrastructure

•

enhancing our culture.

Since 2011, our operating strategy has focused on modernizing our distribution and transmission system to improve safety and reliability.  Since that time, our capital expenditures have increased approximately 14% annually.  Additionally, during this period, we have added new or modified existing regulatory mechanisms to reduce regulatory lag.  Our ability to increase capital spending annually to modernize our system has increased our rate base, which has resulted in rising earnings per share and shareholder value.

Our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity. We continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training.

Operating Segments

As of

September 30, 2019

, we manage and review our consolidated operations through the following reportable segments, which are discussed in further detail below.

•

The

distribution segment

is primarily comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states.

•

The

pipeline and storage segment

is comprised primarily of the pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline-Texas division and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana.

Prior to disposition, the natural gas marketing segment, which was comprised of our natural gas marketing business, was also a reportable segment.



Distribution Segment Overview

The following table summarizes key information about our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions, presented in order of total rate base.

We operate in our service areas under terms of non-exclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve. At

September 30, 2019

, we held 1,017 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years. A significant number of our franchises expire each year, which require renewal prior to the end of their terms. Historically, we have successfully renewed these franchises and believe that we will continue to be able to renew our franchises as they expire.

Revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. These rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business, including a reasonable return on invested capital.  In addition, we transport natural gas for others through our distribution systems.

Rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that (i) are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs, (ii) represent a large component of our cost of service and (iii) are generally outside our control.

Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form of cost adjustment mechanism. Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas. Therefore, although substantially all of our distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase, distribution Contribution Margin is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas.

Additionally, some jurisdictions have performance-based ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to reduce volatility in gas costs. Under the performance-based ratemaking adjustments, purchased gas costs savings are shared between the Company and its customers.

Our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers, including independent producers, marketers and pipeline companies, withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets and peaking and spot purchase agreements, as needed.

Supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply (peaking) quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices. Base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions.

Except for local production purchases, we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by periodically requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service. We select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest reasonable cost. Major suppliers during fiscal


were Castleton Commodities Merchant Trading L.P., CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc., Concord Energy LLC, ConocoPhillips Company, Devon Gas Services, L.P., Hartree Partners, L.P., Targa Gas Marketing LLC,  Tenaska Marketing Ventures & Gas Storage, LLC, Texla Energy Management, Inc. and United Energy Trading, LLC.

The combination of base load, peaking and spot purchase agreements, coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage, allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather, which minimizes our need to enter into long-term firm commitments.



We estimate our peak-day availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 4.4 Bcf. The peak-day demand for our distribution operations in fiscal


was on March 4, 2019, when sales to customers reached approximately 3.3 Bcf.

Currently, our distribution divisions utilize 37 pipeline transportation companies, both interstate and intrastate, to transport our natural gas. The pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline no-notice” storage service, which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies. These agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal. The natural gas supply for our Mid-Tex Division is delivered primarily by our APT Division.

To maintain our deliveries to high priority customers, we have the ability, and have exercised our right, to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state regulations or statutes. Our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering, storage and transmission systems, the duration and severity of cold weather, the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers, the ability to purchase additional supplies on a short-term basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities. Curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the human-needs requirements of our customers on a firm basis. Priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as other factors beyond our control, may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers. We do not anticipate any problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers.

Pipeline and Storage Segment Overview

Our pipeline and storage segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of APT and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana. APT is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in Texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas-producing areas of central, northern and eastern Texas, extending into or near the major producing areas of the Barnett Shale, the Texas Gulf Coast and the Permian Basin of West Texas. Through its system, APT provides transportation and storage services to our Mid-Tex Division, other third party local distribution companies, industrial and electric generation customers, marketers and producers. As part of its pipeline operations, APT owns and operates five underground storage reservoirs in Texas.

Revenues earned from transportation and storage services for APT are subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the RRC. Rates are updated through periodic filings made under Texas’ GRIP. GRIP allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years; the most recent of which was completed in August 2017. APT’s existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under market-based rates.

Our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana are comprised of a 21-mile pipeline located in the New Orleans, Louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in Louisiana under a long-term contract and, on a more limited basis, to third parties. The demand fee charged to our Louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. We also manage two asset management plans in Louisiana that serve distribution affiliates of the Company, which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions. Generally, these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements.

Natural Gas Marketing Segment Overview

Through December 31, 2016, we were engaged in a nonregulated natural gas marketing business, which was conducted by Atmos Energy Marketing (AEM). AEM’s primary business was to aggregate and purchase gas supply, arrange transportation and storage logistics and ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices. Additionally, AEM utilized proprietary and customer-owned transportation and storage assets to provide various services to its customers as requested.

As more fully described in Note


, effective January 1, 2017, we sold all of the equity interests of AEM to CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc. (CES), a subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy Inc. As a result of the sale, Atmos Energy fully exited the nonregulated natural gas marketing business. Accordingly, these operations have been reported as discontinued operations.

Ratemaking Activity

Overview

The method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our regulated businesses operate. The regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment. Generally, each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business, including a reasonable return on invested capital.



Our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag, obtaining adequate returns and providing stable, predictable margins, which benefit both our customers and the Company. As a result of our ratemaking efforts in recent years, Atmos Energy has:

•

Formula rate mechanisms in place in four states that provide for an annual rate review and adjustment to rates.

•

Infrastructure programs in place in the majority of our states that provide for an annual adjustment to rates for qualifying capital expenditures. Through our annual formula rate mechanisms and infrastructure programs, we have the ability to recover approximately 90 percent of our capital expenditures within six months and substantially all of our capital expenditures within twelve months.

•

Authorization in tariffs, statute or commission rules that allows us to defer certain elements of our cost of service such as depreciation, ad valorem taxes and pension costs, until they are included in rates.

•

WNA mechanisms in seven states that serve to minimize the effects of weather on approximately 97 percent of our distribution Contribution Margin.

•

The ability to recover the gas cost portion of bad debts in five states.

The following table provides a jurisdictional rate summary for our regulated operations as of

September 30, 2019

. This information is for regulatory purposes only and may not be representative of our actual financial position.



(1)

The rate base, authorized rate of return, authorized debt/equity ratio and authorized return on equity presented in this table are those from the most recent regulatory filing for each jurisdiction. These rate bases, rates of return, debt/equity ratio and returns on equity are not necessarily indicative of current or future rate bases, rates of return or returns on equity.

(2)

The Mid-Tex rate base represents a “system-wide,” or 100 percent, of the Mid-Tex Division’s rate base.

(3)

A rate base, rate of return, return on equity or debt/equity ratio was not included in the respective state commission’s final decision.

(4)

The West Texas Cities includes all West Texas Division cities except Amarillo, Channing, Dalhart and Lubbock (ALDC).

(5)

The bad debt rider allows us to recover from ratepayers the gas cost portion of bad debts.

(6)

The performance-based rate program provides incentives to distribution companies to minimize purchased gas costs by allowing the companies and their customers to share the purchased gas costs savings.

(7)

The Mississippi Public Service Commission approved a settlement at its meeting on October 24, 2019, which included a rate base of $634.4 million and an authorized return of 7.81%.  New rates were implemented November 1, 2019.

(8)

The Mid-Tex Cities approved the Formula Rate Mechanism filing with rates effective October 1, 2019, which included a rate base of $3,052.6 million, an authorized return of 7.83%, a debt/equity ratio of 42/58 and an authorized ROE of 9.80%.

(9)

The West Texas Cities approved the Formula Rate Mechanism filing with rates effective October 1, 2019, which included a rate base of $591.5 million, an authorized return of 7.83%, a debt/equity ratio of 42/58 and an authorized ROE of 9.80%.

(10)

The West Texas rate base represents a "system-wide," or 100 percent, of the West Texas Division's rate base.

(11)

The Company and the City of Dallas have arrived at a settlement.  This settlement has not yet been approved by the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC).  The DARR rates were implemented subject to refund on June 1, 2019.

Although substantial progress has been made in recent years to improve rate design and recovery of investment across our service areas, we are continuing to seek improvements in rate design to address cost variations and pursue tariffs that reduce regulatory lag associated with investments. Further, potential changes in federal energy policy, federal safety regulations and changing

economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the Company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors.

Recent Ratemaking Activity

The amounts described in the following sections represent the operating income that was requested or received in each rate filing, which may not necessarily reflect the stated amount referenced in the final order, as certain operating costs may have changed as a result of the commission's or other governmental authority's final ruling. The following table summarizes our ratemaking outcomes for the last three fiscal years. The ratemaking outcomes for fiscal 2019 and 2018 include the effect of tax reform legislation enacted effective January 1, 2018 and do not reflect the true economic benefit of the outcomes because they do not include the corresponding income tax benefit we will receive due to the decrease in our statutory tax rate.



Additionally, the following ratemaking efforts seeking

$81.2 million

in annual operating income were initiated during fiscal


but had not been completed as of

September 30, 2019

(5)

The West Texas Cities approved a rate increase of $4.9 million effective October 1, 2019.

Our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below.

Annual Formula Rate Mechanisms

As an instrument to reduce regulatory lag, formula rate mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on an annual basis without filing a formal rate case. However, these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms. The following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms by state.

(1)

Infrastructure mechanisms in Texas and Louisiana allow for the deferral of all expenses associated with capital expenditures incurred pursuant to these rules, which primarily consists of interest, depreciation and other taxes (Texas only), until the next rate proceeding (rate case or annual rate filing), at which time investment and costs would be recoverable through base rates.



The following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms with effective dates during the fiscal years ended September 30,

(1)

The Company and the City of Dallas have arrived at a settlement.  This settlement has not yet been approved by the RRC.  The DARR rates were implemented subject to refund on June 1, 2019.

(2)

Beginning in fiscal 2019, our SGR rate base was combined with our SRF rate base, per Commission order.

Rate Case Filings

A rate case is a formal request from Atmos Energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers. Rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates. This process is referred to as a “show cause” action. Adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the Company’s costs as well as a reasonable rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to safely deliver reliable, reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers. The following table summarizes our recent rate cases:

(1)

The Ad Valorem filing relates to property taxes that are either over or undercollected compared to the amount included in our Kansas service area's base rates.

Other Regulation

We are regulated by various state or local public utility authorities. We are also subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our transmission and distribution facilities. In addition, our operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters. From time to time, we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters. We believe that our properties and operations comply with, and are operated in conformity with, applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations. There are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations. Our environmental claims have arisen primarily from former manufactured gas plant sites. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), within the U.S. Department of Transportation, develops and enforces regulations for the safe, reliable and environmentally sound operation of the pipeline transportation system. The PHMSA pipeline safety statutes provide for states to assume safety authority over intrastate natural transmission and distribution gas pipelines. State pipeline safety programs are responsible for adopting and enforcing the federal and state pipeline safety regulations for intrastate natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allows, pursuant to Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act (NGA), gas transportation services through our APT assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines, without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the NGA. Additionally, the FERC has regulatory authority over the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity. The FERC also has authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with FERC’s other rules, policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale, purchase, transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce. We have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regulations.

The SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, pursuant to the Dodd–Frank Act, established numerous regulations relating to U.S. financial markets. We enacted procedures and modified existing business practices and contractual arrangements to comply with such regulations. There are, however, some rulemaking proceedings that have not yet been finalized, including those relating to capital and margin rules for (non–cleared) swaps. We do not expect these rules to directly impact our business practices or collateral requirements. However, depending on the substance of these final rules, in addition to certain international regulatory requirements still under development that are similar to Dodd–Frank, our swap counterparties could be subject to additional and potentially significant capitalization requirements. These regulations could motivate counterparties to increase our collateral requirements or cash postings.

Competition

Although our regulated distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas, we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers. We compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources, including, in particular, electricity. Electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and



compete for the space heating, water heating and cooking markets. Promotional incentives, improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment. The principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices, and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential, commercial and industrial markets.

Our pipeline and storage operations have historically faced competition from other existing intrastate pipelines seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services for customers. In the last few years, several new pipelines have been completed, which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business.

Employees

At

September 30, 2019

, we had 4,776 employees, consisting of 4,645 employees in our distribution operations and 131 employees in our pipeline and storage operations.

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors.

Our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors, many of which are not within our control. Investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report. These factors include the following:

We are subject to state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results.

We are subject to regulatory oversight from various state and local regulatory authorities in the eight states that we serve.  Therefore, our returns are continuously monitored and are subject to challenge for their reasonableness by the appropriate regulatory authorities or other third-party intervenors.  In the normal course of business, as a regulated entity, we often need to place assets in service and establish historical test periods before rate cases that seek to adjust our allowed returns to recover that investment can be filed.  Further, the regulatory review process can be lengthy in the context of traditional ratemaking.  Because of this process, we suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief, which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag.”

However, in the last several years, a number of regulatory authorities in the states we serve have approved rate mechanisms that provide for annual adjustments to rates that allow us to recover the cost of investments made to replace existing infrastructure or reflect changes in our cost of service.  These mechanisms work to effectively reduce the regulatory lag inherent in the ratemaking process.  However, regulatory lag could significantly increase if the regulatory authorities modify or terminate these rate mechanisms. The regulatory process also involves the risk that regulatory authorities may (i) review our



purchases of natural gas and adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers or (ii) limit the costs we may have incurred from our cost of service that can be recovered from customers.

We are also subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those that govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, the clean-up of contaminated sites, groundwater quality and availability, plant and wildlife protection, as well as work practices related to employee health and safety. Environmental legislation also requires that our facilities, sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, permits and licenses may expose us to fines, penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results. In addition, existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations.

Some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results.

FERC has regulatory authority over some of our operations, including the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity. FERC has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with FERC’s other rules, policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale, purchase, transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce. These rules carry increased penalties for violations. Although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current FERC regulations, changes in FERC regulations or their interpretation by FERC or additional regulations issued by FERC in the future could also adversely affect our business, financial condition or financial results.

We may experience increased federal, state and local regulation of the safety of our operations.

The safety and protection of the public, our customers and our employees is our top priority. We constantly monitor and maintain our pipeline and distribution systems to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely, reliably and efficiently through our network of more than 75,000 miles of distribution and transmission lines. As in recent years, natural gas distribution and pipeline companies are continuing to encounter increasing federal, state and local oversight of the safety of their operations. Although we believe these are costs ultimately recoverable through our rates, the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a short-term adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results.

We may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs.

PHMSA requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and to take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in “high consequence areas” where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm. As pipeline operator, the Company will be required to:

•

perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;

•

identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a “high consequence area”;

•

improve data collection, integration and analysis;

•

repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and

•

implement preventative and mitigating actions.

The Company incurs significant costs associated with its compliance with existing PHMSA and comparable state regulations. Although we believe these are costs ultimately recoverable through our rates, the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a short-term adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results. For example, the adoption of new regulations requiring more comprehensive or stringent safety standards could require installation of new or modified safety controls, new capital projects, or accelerated maintenance programs, all of which could require a potentially significant increase in operating costs.

Distributing, transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs.

Our operations involve a number of hazards and operating risks inherent in storing and transporting natural gas that could affect the public safety and reliability of our distribution system. While Atmos Energy, with the support from each of its regulatory commissions, is accelerating the replacement of aging pipeline infrastructure, operating issues such as as leaks, accidents, equipment problems and incidents, including explosions and fire, could result in legal liability, repair and remediation costs, increased operating costs, significant increased capital expenditures, regulatory fines and penalties and other costs and a loss of customer confidence. We maintain liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks. However, because some of our transmission pipeline and storage facilities are near or are in populated areas,



any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large. If these events were not fully covered by our general liability and property insurance, which policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles, our operations or financial results could be adversely affected.

Our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business, which requires extensive capital spending.

Our operations are capital-intensive. We must make significant capital expenditures on a long-term basis to modernize our distribution and transmission system to improve the safety and reliability and to comply with the safety rules and regulations issued by the regulatory authorities responsible for the service areas we operate. In addition, we must continually build new capacity to serve the growing needs of the communities we serve. The magnitude of these expenditures may be affected by a number of factors, including new regulations, the general state of the economy and weather.

The liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing.  The cost and availability of borrowing funds from third party lenders or issuing equity is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets, interest rates and other market conditions. This in turn may limit the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure.

The Company is dependent on continued access to the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy.

Our long-term debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by Standard & Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. Similar to most companies, we rely upon access to both short-term and long-term credit and capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements. If adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation on our access to the private credit and public capital markets, we could see a reduction in our liquidity. A significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the credit rating agencies. Such a downgrade could further limit our access to private credit and/or public capital markets and increase our costs of borrowing.

While we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future, especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly in the near term. The future effects on our business, liquidity and financial results of a deterioration of current conditions in the credit and capital markets could be material and adverse to us, both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate.

We are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control, which could adversely affect our financial results.

We are subject to market risks beyond our control, including (i) commodity price volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics, counterparty performance or counterparty creditworthiness, and (ii) interest rate risk.  We are generally insulated from commodity price risk through our purchased gas cost mechanisms.  With respect to interest rate risk, we have been operating in a relatively low interest-rate environment in recent years compared to historical norms for both short and long-term interest rates.  However, increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results to the extent that we do not recover our actual interest expense in our rates.

The concentration of our operations in the State of Texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions, weather patterns and regulatory decisions in Texas.

Approximately 70 percent of our consolidated operations are located in the State of Texas. This concentration of our business in Texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the Texas economy in general, weather patterns and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in Texas.

A deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results.

Any adverse changes in economic conditions in the United States, especially in the states in which we operate, could adversely affect the financial resources of many domestic households. As a result, our customers could seek to use less gas and  it may be more difficult for them to pay their gas bills. This would likely lead to slower collections and higher than normal levels of accounts receivable. This, in turn, could increase our financing requirements. Additionally, should economic conditions deteriorate, our industrial customers could seek alternative energy sources, which could result in lower sales volumes.

Increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness.

Rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase in short-term debt. We must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased, which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered. Increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills, leading to higher than normal



accounts receivable. This could result in higher short-term debt levels, greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.

If contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner, our ability to meet our customers’ natural gas requirements may be impaired and our financial condition may be adversely affected.

In order to meet our customers’ annual and seasonal natural gas demands, we must obtain a sufficient supply of natural gas, interstate pipeline capacity and storage capacity.  If we are unable to obtain these, either from our suppliers’ inability to deliver the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.  If a substantial disruption to or reduction in interstate natural gas pipelines’ transmission and storage capacity occurred due to operational failures or disruptions, legislative or regulatory actions, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, terrorist or cyber-attacks or acts of war, our operations or financial results could be adversely affected.

Our operations are subject to increased competition.

In residential and commercial customer markets, our distribution operations compete with other energy products, such as electricity and propane. Our primary product competition is with electricity for heating, water heating and cooking. Increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer. This could adversely impact our business if our customer growth slows or if our customers further conserve their use of gas, resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings.

In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing plants, adverse economic conditions, including higher gas costs, could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy, such as electricity, or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower per-unit costs. Our pipeline and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services for customers. However, in the last few years, several new pipelines have been completed, which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business.

Adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results.

We have weather-normalized rates for approximately 97 percent of our residential and commercial meters in our distribution operations, which substantially mitigates the adverse effects of warmer-than-normal weather for meters in those service areas. However, there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future. The loss of such weather-normalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results. In addition, our operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season. Additionally, sustained cold weather could challenge our ability to adequately meet customer demand in our operations.

The costs of providing health care benefits, pension and postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements may increase substantially.

We provide health care benefits, a cash-balance pension plan and postretirement health care benefits to eligible full-time employees. The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees could significantly increase over time due to rapidly increasing health care inflation, and any future legislative changes related to the provision of health care benefits.  The impact of additional costs which are likely to be passed on to the Company is difficult to measure at this time.

The costs of providing a cash-balance pension plan to eligible full-time employees prior to 2011 and postretirement health care benefits to eligible full-time employees and related funding requirements could be influenced by changes in the market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement health care plans. Any significant declines in the value of these investments due to sustained declines in equity markets or a reduction in bond yields could increase the costs of our pension and postretirement health care plans and related funding requirements in the future. Further, our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to a number of factors, including (i) changing demographics, including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years; (ii) various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due primarily to changing market and economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, and higher or lower withdrawal rates; and (iii) future government regulation.

The costs to the Company of providing these benefits and related funding requirements could also increase materially in the future, should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs, which could adversely affect our financial results.



The inability to continue to hire, train and retain operational, technical and managerial personnel could adversely affect our results of operations.

Although the average age of the employee base of Atmos Energy is not significantly changing year over year, there are still a number of employees who will become eligible to retire within the next five to 10 years.  If we were unable to hire appropriate personnel or contractors to fill future needs, the Company could encounter operating challenges and increased costs, primarily due to a loss of knowledge, errors due to inexperience or the lengthy time period typically required to adequately train replacement personnel.  In addition, higher costs could result from loss of productivity or increased safety compliance issues.  The inability to hire, train and retain new operational, technical and managerial personnel adequately and to transfer institutional knowledge and expertise could adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business.   If we were unable to hire, train and retain appropriately qualified personnel, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

The operations and financial results of the Company could be adversely impacted as a result of climate change.

As climate change occurs, our businesses could be adversely impacted, although we believe it is likely that any such resulting impacts would occur very gradually over a long period of time and thus would be difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity. Such climate change could cause shifts in population, including customers moving away from our service territories.

It could also result in more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, which could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers. If we were unable to deliver natural gas to our customers, our financial results would be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally would have to seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs. To the extent we would be unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs would result in reduced demand for our services, our future business, financial condition or financial results could be adversely impacted.

Greenhouse gas emissions or other legislation or regulations intended to address climate change could increase our operating costs, adversely affecting our financial results, growth, cash flows and results of operations.

Federal, regional and/or state legislative and/or regulatory initiatives may attempt to control or limit the causes of climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Such laws or regulations could impose costs tied to greenhouse gas emissions, operational requirements or restrictions, or additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities. They could also provide a cost advantage to alternative energy sources, impose costs or restrictions on end users of natural gas, or result in other costs or requirements, such as costs associated with the adoption of new infrastructure and technology to respond to new mandates. The focus on climate change could adversely impact the reputation of fossil fuel products or services. The occurrence of the foregoing events could put upward pressure on the cost of natural gas relative to other energy sources, increase our costs and the prices we charge to customers, reduce the demand for natural gas or cause fuel switching to other energy sources, and impact the competitive position of natural gas and the ability to serve new or existing customers, adversely affecting our business, results of operations and cash flows.

Increased dependence on technology may hinder the Company’s business operations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations if such technologies fail.

Over the last several years, the Company has implemented or acquired a variety of technological tools including both Company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties. These tools and systems support critical functions including, scheduling and dispatching of service technicians, automated meter reading systems, customer care and billing, operational plant logistics, management reporting, and external financial reporting. The failure of these or other similarly important technologies, or the Company’s inability to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder its business operations and adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations.

Although the Company has, when possible, developed alternative sources of technology and built redundancy into its computer networks and tools, there can be no assurance that these efforts would protect against all potential issues related to the loss of any such technologies.

Cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or Company information.

Our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems, even though the Company has implemented policies, procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities. We use our information technology systems to manage our distribution and intrastate pipeline and storage operations and other business processes. Disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers, operate our pipeline and storage



systems or serve our customers timely. Accordingly, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.

In addition, we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer, employee and Company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business. Any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release of customer, employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation, increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability. Even though we have insurance coverage in place for many of these cyber-related risks, if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected to the extent not fully covered by such insurance coverage.

Natural disasters, terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results.

Natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations. Also, companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism, which could subject our operations to increased risks. As a result, the availability of insurance covering such risks may become more limited, which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

INTRODUCTION

This section provides management’s discussion of the financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations of Atmos Energy Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources. It includes management’s interpretation of our financial results, the factors affecting these results, the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

Several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance, some of which are described in Item 1A above, “Risk Factors”. They should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward-looking statements.

Cautionary Statement for the Purposes of the Safe Harbor under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report are forward-looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, or any other of our documents or oral presentations, the words “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”, “goal”, “intend”, “objective”, “plan”, “projection”, “seek”, “strategy” or similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy, operations, markets, services, rates, recovery of costs, availability of gas supply and other factors. These risks and uncertainties include the following: state and local regulatory trends and decisions, including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions; increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties; possible increased federal, state and local regulation of the safety of our operations; possible significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs; the inherent hazards and risks involved in distributing, transporting and storing natural gas; the capital-intensive nature of our business; our ability to continue to access the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy; market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities, including commodity price volatility, counterparty performance or creditworthiness and interest rate risk; the concentration of our operations in Texas; the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers; changes in the availability and price of natural gas; the availability and accessibility of contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services; increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy; adverse weather conditions; increased costs of providing health care benefits, along with pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements; the inability to continue to hire, train and retain operational, technical and managerial personnel; the impact of climate change; the impact of greenhouse gas emissions or other legislation or regulations intended to address climate change; increased dependence on technology that may hinder the Company's business if such technologies fail; the threat of cyber-attacks or acts of cyber-terrorism that could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or Company information; natural disasters, terrorist activities or other events and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, while we believe these forward-looking statements to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized. Further, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from estimates.

Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Notes


and


to our consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. Accordingly, these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.







Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Our operations are affected by the cost of natural gas, which is passed through to our customers without markup and includes commodity price, transportation, storage, injection and withdrawal fees and settlements of financial instruments used to mitigate commodity price risk.  These costs are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as purchased gas cost. Therefore, increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. Accordingly, we believe Contribution Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost, is a more useful and relevant measure to analyze our financial performance than operating revenues. As such, the following discussion and analysis of our financial performance will reference Contribution Margin rather than operating revenues and purchased gas cost individually. Further, the term Contribution Margin is not intended to represent operating income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, as an indicator of operating performance and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

As described further in Note


, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "TCJA") required us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities at our new federal statutory income tax rate as of December 22, 2017. The remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities resulted in the recognition of a non-cash income tax benefit of

$158.8

million for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

. Due to the non-recurring nature of this benefit, we believe that net income and diluted net income per share before the non-cash income tax benefit provide a more relevant measure to analyze our financial performance than net income and diluted net income per share in order to allow investors to better analyze our core results and allow the information to be presented on a comparative basis to the prior year. Accordingly, the following discussion and analysis of our financial performance will reference adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP measures, which are calculated as follows:

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

Atmos Energy strives to operate its businesses safely and reliably while delivering superior shareholder value.  Our commitment to modernizing our natural gas distribution and transmission systems requires a significant level of capital spending.  We have the ability to begin recovering a significant portion of these investments timely through rate designs and mechanisms that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved rate from customer usage patterns.  The execution of our capital spending program, the ability to recover these investments timely and our ability to access the capital markets to satisfy our financing needs are the primary drivers that affect our financial performance.

During fiscal


, we recorded net income of

$511.4 million

, or

$4.35

per diluted share, compared to net income of

$603.1 million

, or

$5.43

per diluted share in the prior year. After adjusting for the nonrecurring benefit recognized after implementing the TCJA in fiscal 2018, we recorded adjusted net income of

$444.3 million

, or

$4.00

per diluted share for the year ended

September 30, 2018

.



The following table details our consolidated net income by segment during the last three fiscal years:

The year-over-year increase in adjusted net income of

$67.1 million

, or 15 percent, largely reflects positive rate outcomes driven by safety and reliability spending, customer growth in our distribution business, positive Contribution Margin in our pipeline and storage business primarily due to positive supply and demand dynamics affecting the Permian Basin due to wider spreads and the impact of the TCJA on our effective income tax rate. During the year ended

September 30, 2019

, we implemented ratemaking regulatory actions which resulted in an increase in annual operating income of

$116.7 million

and had nine ratemaking efforts in progress at

September 30, 2019

, seeking a total increase in annual operating income of

$81.2 million

.

Capital expenditures for fiscal


increased 15 percent period-over-period, to

$1.7 billion

. Over 80 percent was invested to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission systems, with a significant portion of this investment incurred under regulatory mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag to six months or less. We funded a portion of our current-year capital expenditures program through operating cash flows of

$968.8 million

. Additionally, we completed over $2 billion in external financing during the year ended

September 30, 2019

with the issuance of $1.1 billion in 30-year senior notes and over $1.0 billion of common stock, of which approximately $470 million was allocated to forward sale agreements which have not yet been settled.  The net proceeds from these issuances, together with available cash, were used to repay at maturity our $450 million 8.5% unsecured senior notes, to repay short-term debt under our commercial paper program, to fund capital spending and for general corporate purposes.

Additionally, on October 2, 2019, we completed a public offering of

$300 million

of

2.625%

senior notes due 2029 and

$500 million

of

3.375%

senior notes due 2049. We received net proceeds from the offering, after underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses of approximately

$791.6 million

, that were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of working capital borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program. The effective interest rate of these notes is

2.72%

and

3.42%

after giving effect to the offering costs.

As a result of the continued contribution and stability of our earnings, cash flows and capital structure, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 9.5% percent for fiscal 2020.

Distribution

Segment

The

distribution

segment is primarily comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states. The primary factors that impact the results of our distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas.

Our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions to minimize regulatory lag and, ultimately, separate the recovery of our approved rates from customer usage patterns. Improving rate design is a long-term process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions. The “Ratemaking Activity” section of this Form 10-K describes our current rate strategy, progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail.

We are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms; therefore, increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. Contribution Margin in our Texas and Mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipt taxes, which are calculated as a percentage of revenue (inclusive of gas costs).  Therefore, the amount of these taxes included in revenue is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes.  We record the associated tax expense as a component of taxes, other than income.  Although changes in revenue related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect Contribution Margin, over time the impact is offset within operating income.

Although the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our Contribution Margin, higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense, and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. In addition, higher gas costs, as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or, in the case of industrial consumers, to use alternative energy sources. Currently, gas cost risk has been mitigated by rate design that allows us to collect



from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 76 percent of our residential and commercial margins.

During fiscal


, we completed


regulatory proceedings in our

distribution

segment, resulting in a

$67.5 million

increase in annual operating income.

Review of Financial and Operating Results

Financial and operational highlights for our

distribution

segment for the fiscal years ended

September 30, 2019

,


and


are presented below.

(1)

In accordance with our adoption of new accounting standards, changes in income statement presentation were implemented on a retrospective basis and impacted previously issued financial statements for the fiscal years ended 2018 and 2017, as discussed in greater detail in Note 2.

Fiscal year ended

September 30, 2019

compared with fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

Income before income taxes for our

distribution

segment increased slightly, primarily due to a

$33.7 million

increase in Contribution Margin and a combined $18.7 million decrease in other non-operating expense and interest charges, partially offset by a $

48.6 million

increase in operating expenses. The year-to-date increase in Contribution Margin primarily reflects:

•

a $33.0 million net increase in rate adjustments, after the effect of the TCJA, primarily in our Mid-Tex, Mississippi and West Texas Divisions.

•

a $12.8 million increase from customer growth primarily in our Mid-Tex Division.

•

a $9.6 million decrease in revenue-related taxes primarily in our Mid-Tex Division, offset by a corresponding $9.8 million decrease in the related tax expense.

•

a $2.3 million decrease in residential and commercial net consumption.

Operating expenses, which include operating and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes, other than income, increased

$48.6 million

primarily due to:

•

a $35.9 million increase in depreciation expense and property taxes associated with increased capital investments.

•

a $20.7 million increase in pipeline maintenance and related activities.

•

a $13.7 million increase in employee and training costs as we have increased service-related headcount to support operations in our fastest growing service territories.

•

a $3.5 million increase in software maintenance fees.

•

a $24.3 million decrease in nonrecurring expenses related to the planned outage of our natural gas distribution system in Northwest Dallas in March 2018.



The year-over-year decrease in other non-operating expense and interest charges of $18.7 million is primarily due to increased capitalized interest and AFUDC, as well as decreases due to the adoption of new accounting standards. As discussed further in Note 2, we are now required to recognize changes in the fair value of our equity securities formerly designated as available-for-sale on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and the components of net periodic cost other than the service cost component are included in other non-operating expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. These decreases are partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to the issuance of long-term debt during fiscal 2019.

The decrease in income tax expense reflects a reduction in our effective tax rate from 26.1% to 21.1%, as a result of the TCJA.

The fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 for our distribution segment is described in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.

The following table shows our operating income by distribution division, in order of total rate base, for the fiscal years ended

September 30, 2019

,


and


. The presentation of our distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes.

Pipeline and Storage

Segment

Our

pipeline and storage

segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of APT and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana.  APT is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in Texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas producing areas of central, northern and eastern Texas, extending into or near the major producing areas of the Barnett Shale, the Texas Gulf Coast and the Permian Basin of West Texas. APT provides transportation and storage services to our Mid-Tex Division, other third party local distribution companies, industrial and electric generation customers, as well as marketers and producers. As part of its pipeline operations, APT owns and operates five underground storage facilities in Texas.

Our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana are comprised of a 21-mile pipeline located in the New Orleans, Louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in Louisiana under a long-term contract and, on a more limited basis, to third parties. The demand fee charged to our Louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. We also manage two asset management plans, which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions. Generally, these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements.

Our

pipeline and storage

segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our Texas and Louisiana service areas. Natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation and storage of natural gas. However, natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the supply areas that we serve, which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipelines. Further, natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve in Texas could influences the volumes of gas transported for shippers through Texas pipeline systems and rates for such transportation.

The results of APT are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of its local distribution company customers. Additionally, its operations may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs.



APT annually uses GRIP to recover capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year. On February 15, 2019, APT made a GRIP filing that covered changes in net investment from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 with a requested increase in operating income of $49.2 million. On May 7, 2019, the RRC approved the Company's GRIP filing.

On December 21, 2016, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved an annual increase of five percent to the demand fee charged by our natural gas transmission pipeline for each of the next 10 years, effective October 1, 2017.

Review of Financial and Operating Results

Financial and operational highlights for our

pipeline and storage

segment for the fiscal years ended

September 30, 2019

,


and


are presented below.

Fiscal year ended

September 30, 2019

compared with fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

Income before income taxes for our

pipeline and storage

segment increased 18 percent, primarily due to a

$61.6 million

increase in Contribution Margin, partially offset by a

$28.6 million

increase in operating expenses.  The increase in Contribution Margin primarily reflects:

•

a $46.5 million net increase in rate adjustments, after the effect of the TCJA, primarily from the approved GRIP filings approved in May 2018 and May 2019. The increase in rates was driven primarily by increased safety and reliability spending.

•

a net increase of $12.2 million primarily from positive supply and demand dynamics affecting the Permian Basin, due to wider spreads.

The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher depreciation expense of $11.6 million associated with increased capital investments and higher system maintenance expense of $15.3 million primarily due to spending on hydro testing and in-line inspections.

The decrease in income tax expense primarily reflects a reduction in our effective tax rate from 29.8% to 21.7%, as a result of the TCJA.

The fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 for our pipeline and storage segment is described in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.

Natural Gas Marketing

Segment

Through December 31, 2016, we were engaged in an unregulated natural gas marketing business, which was conducted by Atmos Energy Marketing (AEM). AEM’s primary business was to aggregate and purchase gas supply, arrange transportation and storage logistics and ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices.



As more fully described in Note


, effective January 1, 2017, we sold all of the equity interests of AEM to CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc. (CES), a subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy Inc. As a result of the sale, Atmos Energy fully exited the nonregulated natural gas marketing business. Accordingly, a gain on sale from discontinued operations for

$2.7 million

was recorded and net income of

$11.0 million

for AEM is reported as discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2017.

The fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 for our natural gas marketing segment is described in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing. External debt financing is provided primarily through the issuance of long-term debt, a $1.5 billion commercial paper program and three committed revolving credit facilities with a total availability from third-party lenders of approximately $1.5 billion. The commercial paper program and credit facilities provide cost-effective, short-term financing until it can be replaced with a balance of long-term debt and equity financing that achieves the Company's desired capital structure with an equity-to-total-capitalization ratio between

50%

and

60%

, inclusive of long-term and short-term debt. Additionally, we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis. The liquidity provided by these sources is expected to be sufficient to fund the Company's working capital needs and capital expenditures program for fiscal year 2020 and beyond.

To support our capital market activities, we filed a registration statement with the SEC on November 13, 2018 that permits us to issue a total of

$3.0 billion

in common stock and/or debt securities. The registration statement replaced our previous registration statement that was effectively exhausted in October 2018. At

September 30, 2019

, approximately

$1.3 billion

of securities remained available for issuance under the shelf registration statement.

On November 19, 2018, we filed a prospectus supplement under the registration statement relating to an at-the-market (ATM) equity sales program under which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of $500 million (including shares of common stock that may be sold pursuant to forward sale agreements entered into concurrently with the ATM equity sales program). At

September 30, 2019

, approximately

$75 million

remained available under the ATM equity sales program.

For the year ended

September 30, 2019

, we completed over $2 billion of long-term debt and equity financing. During fiscal 2019, we executed forward sales with various forward sellers who borrowed and sold 6,813,135 shares of our common stock for initial aggregate proceeds of approximately $673 million.

The following table summarizes the remaining availability under our various forward sales as of

September 30, 2019

:

The following table presents our capitalization as of

September 30, 2019

Cash Flows

Our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These factors include regulatory changes, the price for our services, the demand for such products and services, margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks and other factors.

Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended

September 30, 2019

,


and


are presented below.

Cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 is described in Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.

Cash flows from operating activities

For the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2019

, we generated cash flow from operating activities of

$968.8 million

compared with

$1,124.7 million

in the prior year. The year-over-year

decrease

is primarily attributable to the change in net income and working capital changes, particularly in our distribution segment resulting from the timing of payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries.

Cash flows from investing activities

Our capital expenditures are primarily used to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission system through pipeline replacement and system modernization and to enhance and expand our system to meet customer needs. Over the last three fiscal years, approximately 84 percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of our system.

We allocate our capital spending among our service areas using risk management models and subject matter experts to identify, assess and develop a plan of action to address our highest risk facilities.  We have regulatory mechanisms in most of our service areas that provide the opportunity to include approved capital costs in rate base on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case.  These mechanisms permit us a reasonable opportunity to earn a fair return on our investment without compromising safety or reliability.

For the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2019

, we had

$1.7 billion

in capital expenditures compared with

$1.5 billion

for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

. Capital spending increased by $225.9 million, or 15%, as a result of planned increases in our distribution segment to repair and replace vintage pipe and increases in spending in our pipeline and storage segment to improve the reliability of gas service to our local distribution company customers.

Cash flows from financing activities

Our financing activities provided

$725.7 million

and

$326.3 million

in cash for fiscal years


and


. Our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended

September 30, 2019

and


are summarized as follows:


During the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2019

, we received $1.7 billion in net proceeds from the issuance and repayment of long-term debt and issuance of equity. This activity is summarized below:

•

In October 2018, we completed the public offering of $600 million of 30-year 4.30% senior notes.  The net proceeds of

$590.6 million

were used to repay working capital borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program.



•

In November 2018, we sold

5,390,836

shares of common stock for $500 million.  The net proceeds of

$494.1 million

were used to fund our capital expenditure program and for general corporate purposes.

•

In March 2019, we completed the public offering of $450 million of 30-year 4.125% senior notes.  The net proceeds of

$443.4 million

, together with available cash, were used to repay at maturity our $450 million 8.50% 10-year unsecured senior notes due March 15, 2019 and the related settlement of our interest rate swaps for $90.1 million.

•

In May and August 2019, we settled forward sale agreements for 2,183,275 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $200 million.

•

In September 2019, we repaid our $125 million floating rate term loan at its maturity.

Additionally, cash dividends increased due to an 8.2 percent increase in our dividend rate and an increase in shares outstanding.


During the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

, we used $395.1 million in net proceeds from equity financing to reduce short-term debt, to support our capital spending and for other general corporate purposes.

The following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended

Share amounts do not include shares issued under forward sale agreements until the shares have been settled.

Credit Ratings

Our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the cost of such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors, including but not limited to, debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt, operating cash flow coverage of interest and operating cash flow less dividends to debt. In addition, the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time, the risks associated with our business and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate.

Our debt is rated by two rating agencies: Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P) and Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s).  On December 14, 2018, Moody's affirmed our debt ratings and changed their outlook from stable to positive, citing improvements to our regulatory construct that reduce investment recovery lag and our balanced fiscal policy. As of

September 30, 2019

, S&P maintained a stable outlook. Our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows:

A significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the two credit rating agencies. This would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings.



A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. The highest investment grade credit rating is AAA for S&P and Aaa for Moody’s. The lowest investment grade credit rating is BBB- for S&P and Baa3 for Moody’s. Our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. There can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, or withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant.

Debt Covenants

We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of

September 30, 2019

. Our debt covenants are described in Note


to the consolidated financial statements.

Future minimum lease payments do not include amounts for fleet leases and other de minimis items that can be renewed beyond the initial lease term. The Company anticipates renewing the leases beyond the initial term, but the anticipated payments associated with the renewals do not meet the definition of expected minimum lease payments and therefore are not included above. Expected payments for these leases are

$17.6 million

in 2020,

$18.0 million

in 2021,

$11.8 million

in 2022,

$8.5 million

Represents liabilities for natural gas commodity financial instruments that were valued as of

September 30, 2019

. The ultimate settlement amounts of these remaining liabilities are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk until the financial instruments are settled.

(6)

Represents expected contributions to our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans, which are discussed in Note


to the consolidated financial statements. Based upon current market conditions, the current funded position of the plans and the funding requirements under the PPA, we do not anticipate minimum required contributions for the foreseeable future. However, we may consider whether a voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain funding levels.

(7)

Represents liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions claimed or expected to be claimed on tax returns.  The amount does not include interest and penalties that may be applied to these positions.

We maintain supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year. Commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices. Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts. Our Mid-Tex Division also maintains a limited number of long-term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market and fixed prices.  At

September 30, 2019

, we were committed to purchase

40.1

Bcf within one year and

1.6

Bcf within two to three years under indexed contracts.

The change in deferred taxes related to our cost of service ratemaking (referred to as excess deferred taxes) was reclassified into a regulatory liability and will be returned to ratepayers in accordance with regulatory requirements. At

September 30, 2019

, this liability totaled

$726.3 million

. We received approval from regulators to return excess deferred taxes in most of our jurisdictions in accordance with regulatory proceedings on a provisional basis over periods ranging from


to




years. In our remaining jurisdictions, the treatment of the effects of the TCJA in rates is being addressed in ongoing or will be addressed in future regulatory proceedings. See Note


for further information.

Risk Management Activities

In our distribution and pipeline and storage segments, we use a combination of physical storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter-period gas price increases. In the past we managed interest rate risk by entering into financial instruments to effectively fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings.

We record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities, which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument. Substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices.

The following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our financial instruments for the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2019

(in thousands):

The fair value of our financial instruments at

RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

Recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are described in Note


to the consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates. Commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity. Interest-rate risk is the potential increased cost we could incur when we issue debt instruments or to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities. Additionally, interest-rate risk could affect our ability to issue cost effective equity instruments.

We conduct risk management activities in our distribution and pipeline and storage segments. In our distribution segment, we use a combination of physical storage, fixed-price forward contracts and financial instruments, primarily over-the-counter swap and option contracts, in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season. Our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in Note


to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, our earnings are affected by changes in short-term interest rates as a result of our issuance of short-term commercial paper and our other short-term borrowings.

Commodity Price Risk

We purchase natural gas for our distribution operations. Substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. Therefore, our distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure.



Interest Rate Risk

Our earnings are exposed to changes in short-term interest rates associated with our short-term commercial paper program and other short-term borrowings. We use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our short-term interest rate risk. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our short-term interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our short-term borrowings. Had interest rates associated with our short-term borrowings increased by an average of one percent, our interest expense would not have been materially increased during

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Atmos Energy Corporation

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Atmos Energy Corporation (the “Company“) as of

September 30, 2019

and


, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, shareholders‘ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended

September 30, 2019

, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 8 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of

September 30, 2019

and


, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

September 30, 2019

, in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

September 30, 2019

, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated

November 12, 2019

expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company‘s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company‘s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.



How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over the initial determination and approval of expenditures for either capital additions or maintenance and repair. For example, we selected a sample of projects initiated during the year to evaluate the effectiveness of management’s review controls to determine the proper categorization of project expenditures as either capitalizable costs or current-period expense.

Our audit procedures included, among others, testing a sample of projects initiated during the year, including the evaluation of the nature of the project, with Company personnel outside of accounting and financial reporting. For example, we evaluated project setup through inspection of each project’s description for compliance with the Company’s capitalization policy as described in Note 2 and a series of inquiries of the project approver to understand how they assessed whether projects should be treated as capital or expense. Other audit procedures included evaluating whether the descriptions and amounts included on third-party invoices either support or contradict the project classification as capital, evaluating the appropriateness of individuals capitalizing direct labor charges to projects by assessing the relevance of their job function to the capital project, and recalculating other overhead costs capitalized to projects.

Nature of Business

Atmos Energy Corporation (“Atmos Energy” or the “Company”) and its subsidiaries are engaged in the regulated natural gas distribution and pipeline and storage businesses.

Through our distribution business, we deliver natural gas through sales and transportation arrangements to over

three million

residential, commercial, public-authority and industrial customers through our

six

regulated distribution divisions in the service areas described below:

(1)

Denotes location where we have more limited service areas.

In addition, we transport natural gas for others through our distribution system. Our distribution business is subject to federal and state regulation and/or regulation by local authorities in each of the states in which our distribution divisions operate. Our corporate headquarters and shared-services function are located in Dallas, Texas, and our customer support centers are located in Amarillo and Waco, Texas.

Our pipeline and storage business, which is also subject to federal and state regulation, consists of the the pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline–Texas (APT) Division and our natural gas transmission business in Louisiana. The APT division provides transportation and storage services to our Mid-Tex Division, other third-party local distribution companies, industrial and electric generation customers, as well as marketers and producers. As part of its pipeline operations, APT manages five underground storage facilities in Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary to the pipeline industry including parking arrangements, lending and sales of inventory on hand. Our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana are comprised of a 21-mile pipeline located in the New Orleans, Louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in Louisiana under a long-term contract and on a more limited basis, to third parties.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation

— The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Atmos Energy Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated; however, we have not eliminated intercompany profits when such amounts are probable of recovery under the affiliates’ rate regulation process.

Use of estimates

— The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The most significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, unbilled revenues, contingency accruals, pension and postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes, impairment of long-lived assets, risk management and trading activities, fair value measurements and the valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Regulation

— Our distribution and pipeline and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. Our accounting policies recognize the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require cost-based, rate-regulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect the authorized recovery of costs due to regulatory decisions in their financial statements. As a result, certain costs are permitted to be capitalized rather than expensed because they can be recovered through rates. We record certain costs as regulatory assets when future recovery through customer rates is considered probable. Regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process. The amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations. Further, regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized.



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Substantially all of our regulatory assets are recorded as a component of deferred charges and other assets and our regulatory liabilities are recorded as a component of other current liabilities and deferred credits and other liabilities. Deferred gas costs are recorded either in other current assets or liabilities and the long-term portion of regulatory excess deferred taxes and regulatory cost of removal obligation are reported separately.

Significant regulatory assets and liabilities as of

September 30, 2019

and


included the following:

(1)

Infrastructure mechanisms in Texas and Louisiana allow for the deferral of all eligible expenses associated with capital expenditures incurred pursuant to these rules, including the recording of interest on the deferred expenses until the next rate proceeding (rate case or annual rate filing), at which time investment and costs would be recovered through base rates.

(2)

The TCJA resulted in the remeasurement of the net deferred tax liability included in our rate base. Of this amount,

$

21.2

million

as of

September 30, 2019

and $

5.2

million

as of

September 30, 2018

is recorded in other current liabilities. The period and timing of the return of the excess deferred taxes is being determined by regulators in each of our jurisdictions. See Note 13 for further information.

Revenue recognition

— Effective October 1, 2018, we adopted the new guidance under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606. See “Accounting pronouncements adopted in fiscal 2019” herein and Note 5 for information regarding our adoption of ASC 606 and the related disclosures.

Distribution Revenues

Distribution revenues represent the delivery of natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial and public authority customers at prices based on tariff rates established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate.  Revenue is recognized and our performance obligation is satisfied over time when natural gas is delivered and simultaneously consumed by our customer.  We have elected to use the invoice practical expedient and recognize revenue for volumes delivered that we have the right to invoice our customers.  We read meters and bill our customers on a monthly cycle basis.  Accordingly, we estimate volumes from the last meter read to the balance sheet date and accrue revenue for gas delivered but not yet billed.

In our Texas and Mississippi jurisdictions, we pay franchise fees and gross receipt taxes to operate in these service areas.  These franchise fees and gross receipts taxes are required to be paid regardless of our ability to collect from our customers. Accordingly, we account for these amounts on a gross basis in revenue and we record the associated tax expense as a component of taxes, other than income.



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Pipeline and Storage Revenues

Pipeline and storage revenues primarily represent the transportation and storage of natural gas on our APT system and the transmission of natural gas through our 21-mile pipeline in Louisiana.  APT provides transportation and storage services to our Mid-Tex Division, other third party local distribution companies and certain industrial customers under tariff rates approved by the RRC.  APT also provides certain transportation and storage services to industrial and electric generation customers, as well as marketers and producers, under negotiated rates.  Our pipeline in Louisiana is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our Louisiana Division under a long-term contract and on a more limited basis to third parties.  The demand fee charged to our Louisiana Division is subject to regulatory approval by the Louisiana Public Service Commission.  We also manage two asset management plans with distribution affiliates of the Company at terms that have been approved by the applicable state regulatory commissions.  The performance obligations for these transportation customers are satisfied by means of transporting customer-supplied gas to the designated location. Revenue is recognized and our performance obligation is satisfied over time when natural gas is delivered to the customer. Management determined that these arrangements qualify for the invoice practical expedient for recognizing revenue. For demand fee arrangements, revenue is recognized and our performance obligation is satisfied by standing ready to transport natural gas over the period of each individual month.

Alternative Revenue Program Revenues

In our distribution segment, we have weather-normalization adjustment mechanisms that serve to minimize the effects of weather on our Contribution Margin.  Additionally, APT has a regulatory mechanism that requires that we share with its tariffed customers


%

of the difference between the total non-tariffed revenues earned during a test period and a revenue benchmark of

that was established in its most recent rate case. Differences between actual revenues and revenues calculated under these mechanisms adjust the amount billed to customers. These mechanisms are considered to be alternative revenue programs under accounting standards generally accepted in the United States as they are deemed to be contracts between us and our regulator. Accordingly, revenue under these mechanisms are excluded from revenue from contracts with customers.

Purchased gas costs

— Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide gas distribution companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of their non-gas costs. There is no margin generated through purchased gas cost adjustments, but they provide a dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or decreases in our distribution segment’s gas costs. The effects of these purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our consolidated balance sheets.

Discontinued operations

— Accounting policies specific to our discontinued natural gas marketing business are described in more detail in Note 16.

Cash and cash equivalents

— We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts

— Accounts receivable arise from natural gas sales to residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and other customers. We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect based on our collection experience or where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability or reluctance to pay. However, if circumstances change, our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be affected. Circumstances which could affect our estimates include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, the level of natural gas prices, customer deposits and general economic conditions. Accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible.

Gas stored underground

— Our gas stored underground is comprised of natural gas injected into storage to support the winter season withdrawals for our distribution operations. The average cost method is used for all of our distribution operations. Gas in storage that is retained as cushion gas to maintain reservoir pressure is classified as property, plant and equipment and is valued at cost.

Property, plant and equipment

— Regulated property, plant and equipment is stated at original cost, net of contributions in aid of construction. The cost of additions includes direct construction costs, payroll related costs (taxes, pensions and other fringe benefits), administrative and general costs and an allowance for funds used during construction. The allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) represents the capitalizable total cost of funds used to finance the construction of major projects.

The following table details amounts capitalized for the fiscal year ended September 30.

Major renewals, including replacement pipe, and betterments that are recoverable through our regulatory rate base are capitalized while the costs of maintenance and repairs that are not capitalizable are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of large projects are accumulated in construction in progress until the project is completed. When the project is completed, tested and placed in service, the balance is transferred to the regulated plant in service account included in the rate base and depreciation begins.

Regulated property, plant and equipment is depreciated at various rates on a straight-line basis. These rates are approved by our regulatory commissions and are comprised of two components: one based on average service life and one based on cost of removal. Accordingly, we recognize our cost of removal expense as a component of depreciation expense. The related cost of removal accrual is reflected as a regulatory liability on the consolidated balance sheet. At the time property, plant and equipment is retired, removal expenses less salvage, are charged to the regulatory cost of removal accrual. The composite depreciation rate was

3.1

,

3.2

and

for the fiscal years ended

,


and


.

Other property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is generally computed on the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes based upon estimated useful lives.

Asset retirement obligations

— We record a liability at fair value for an asset retirement obligation when the legal obligation to retire the asset has been incurred with an offsetting increase to the carrying value of the related asset. Accretion of the asset retirement obligation due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense.

As of

September 30, 2019

and


, we had asset retirement obligations of

$

17.1

million

and

$

12.9

million

. Additionally, we had

$

11.3

million

and

$

7.5

million

of asset retirement costs recorded as a component of property, plant and equipment that will be depreciated over the remaining life of the underlying associated assets.

We believe we have a legal obligation to retire our natural gas storage facilities. However, we have not recognized an asset retirement obligation associated with our storage facilities because we are not able to determine the settlement date of this obligation as we do not anticipate taking our storage facilities out of service permanently. Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of this obligation.

Impairment of long-lived assets

— We evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that other long-lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision. When such events or circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected future cash flows. In the event the sum of the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value is recorded.

Goodwill

— We annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or more frequently as impairment indicators arise. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed our annual goodwill impairment assessment using a qualitative assessment, as permitted under U.S. GAAP. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit. Based on the assessment performed, we determined that our goodwill was not impaired. Although not applicable for the fiscal 2019 analysis, if the qualitative assessment resulted in impairment indicators, we would then use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. These calculations are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rate. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value.

Marketable securities

— As of

September 30, 2019

, we hold marketable securities classified as either equity or debt securities. Beginning on October 1, 2018, changes in fair value of our equity securities were recorded in net income as discussed further below in the

Recent accounting pronouncements

section. Debt securities, which are considered available for sale securities, are reported at market value with unrealized gains and losses shown as a component of accumulated other



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

comprehensive income (loss). During fiscal 2018 and under the previous accounting guidance, all our debt and equity securities were considered available for sale securities.

We regularly evaluate the performance of our available for sale debt securities on an investment by investment basis for impairment, taking into consideration the securities’ purpose, volatility and current returns. If a determination is made that a decline in fair value is other than temporary, the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value.

Financial instruments and hedging activities

— We currently use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk in our

distribution

and

pipeline and storage

segments and in the past have also used financial instruments to mitigate interest rate risk. The objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have been tailored to our business and are discussed in Note


.

We record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value

,

with changes in fair value ultimately recorded in the statement of comprehensive income. These financial instruments are reported as risk management assets and liabilities and are classified as current or noncurrent other assets or liabilities based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument. We record the cash flow impact of our financial instruments in operating cash flows based upon their balance sheet classification.

The timing of when changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recorded in the statement of comprehensive income depends on whether the financial instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a different accounting treatment. Changes in fair value for financial instruments that do not meet one of these criteria are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income as they occur.

Financial Instruments Associated with Commodity Price Risk

In our

distribution

segment, the costs associated with and the realized gains and losses arising from the use of financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk are included in our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms in accordance with regulatory requirements. Therefore, changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are initially recorded as a component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a component of purchased gas cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and recognized in revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, there is no earnings impact on our

distribution

segment as a result of the use of these financial instruments.

Financial Instruments Associated with Interest Rate Risk

In connection with the planned issuance of long-term debt, we may use financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. We historically managed this risk through the use of forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings. We designate these financial instruments as cash flow hedges at the time the agreements are executed.  Unrealized gains and losses associated with the instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). When the instruments settle, the realized gain or loss is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized as a component of interest charges over the life of the related financing arrangement. Hedge ineffectiveness to the extent incurred is reported as a component of interest charges. As of

September 30, 2019

and

September 30, 2018

,

no

cash was required to be held in margin accounts.

Fair Value Measurements

— We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). We primarily use quoted market prices and other observable market pricing information in valuing our financial assets and liabilities and minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our measurements.

Fair-value estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved. Our counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies. This concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market, economic or regulatory conditions. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral requirements under certain circumstances.

Amounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially significant volatility based upon changes in market prices, including, but not limited to, the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts, maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions and interest rates, each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our financial instruments. We believe the market prices and models used to value these financial instruments represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts. Values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions.



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Authoritative accounting literature establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value based on observable and unobservable data. The hierarchy categorizes the inputs into three levels, with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The levels of the hierarchy are described below:

Level 1

— Represents unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is defined as a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet at fair value.

Our Level 1 measurements consist primarily of our debt and equity securities. The Level 1 measurements for investments in the Atmos Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust (the Master Trust), Supplemental Executive Benefit Plan and postretirement benefit plan consist primarily of exchange-traded financial instruments.

Level 2

— Represents pricing inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability as of the reporting date. These inputs are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Our Level 2 measurements primarily consist of non-exchange-traded financial instruments, such as over-the-counter options and swaps and municipal and corporate bonds where market data for pricing is observable. The Level 2 measurements for investments in our Master Trust, Supplemental Executive Benefit Plan and postretirement benefit plan consist primarily of non-exchange traded financial instruments such as corporate bonds and government securities.

Level 3

— Represents generally unobservable pricing inputs which are developed based on the best information available, including our own internal data, in situations where there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. The pricing inputs utilized reflect what a market participant would use to determine fair value. We currently do not have any Level 3 investments.

Pension and other postretirement plans

— Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data. Our measurement date is September 30. The assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities. For the valuation performed as of

September 30, 2019

, decreases in the discount rate resulted in actuarial losses that increased our plan obligations.

The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligation and net pension and postretirement cost. When establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace that are suitable for settling the obligations, changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with currently available high quality corporate bonds.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension and postretirement plan cost. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the guidance from our investment advisors when making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan cost is not affected. Rather, this gain or loss is amortized over the expected future working lifetime of the plan participants.

The expected return on plan assets is then calculated by applying the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets to the market-related value of the plan assets.  The market-related value of our plan assets represents the fair market value of the plan assets, adjusted to smooth out short-term market fluctuations over a five-year period. The use of this calculation will delay the impact of current market fluctuations on the pension expense for the period.

We use a corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses.  Under this approach, net gains or losses in excess of ten percent of the larger of the pension benefit obligation or the market-related value of the assets are amortized on a straight-line basis.  The period of amortization is the average remaining service of active participants who are expected to receive benefits under the plan.

We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our annual postretirement net cost based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon the annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date.

Income taxes

— Income taxes are determined based on the liability method, which results in income tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences. Temporary differences are differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The liability method requires the effect of tax rate changes on accumulated deferred income taxes to be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted. The liability method also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized.

The Company may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities. We recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of interest charges. We recognize penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of miscellaneous income (expense) in accordance with regulatory requirements.

Tax collections

— We are allowed to recover from customers revenue-related taxes that are imposed upon us. We record such taxes as operating expenses and record the corresponding customer charges as operating revenues. However, we do collect and remit various other taxes on behalf of various governmental authorities, and we record these amounts in our consolidated balance sheets on a net basis. We do not collect income taxes from our customers on behalf of governmental authorities.

Contingencies

— In the normal course of business, we are confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits, claims made by third parties or the action of various regulatory agencies. For such matters, we record liabilities when they are considered probable and estimable, based on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the liability in the future. Actual results may differ from estimates, depending on actual outcomes or changes in the facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure.

Subsequent events

— Except as noted in Note 6 regarding the public offering of senior notes, no events occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date that would require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.

Recent accounting pronouncements

Accounting pronouncements adopted in fiscal 2019

During fiscal 2019, we adopted the following accounting guidance updates.  The adoption of this new guidance, individually and collectively, did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

•

Revenue recognition

- We adopted the new guidance October 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Under the new guidance, we are required to recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The implementation of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flow or business processes. However, the guidance introduced new disclosures which are presented in Note 5.

•

Classification and measurement of financial instruments

- The new guidance requires that we recognize changes in the fair value of our equity securities formerly designated as available-for-sale in other non-operating income (expense) in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a prospective basis from the date of adoption. However, we continue to classify cash flows from purchases and sales of equity securities within investing activities given the nature of these securities. Additionally, in accordance with the guidance, we reclassified a net

$

8.2

million

unrealized gain related to these equity securities from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to retained earnings at October 1, 2018. The accounting for debt securities designated as available-for-sale did not change as a result of this new guidance. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these securities will continue to be recorded as a component of AOCI.

•

Presentation of the Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost

- On October 1, 2018, we adopted the new guidance, which requires us to present only the current service cost component of the net benefit cost within operations and maintenance expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The remaining components of net benefit cost are now recorded in other non-operating income (expense) in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The change in presentation of these costs was implemented on a retrospective basis as required by the guidance. In lieu of determining how each component of the net periodic benefit cost was actually reflected in the prior periods’ statement of comprehensive income, we elected to utilize a practical expedient that permits the use of the amounts disclosed for these costs in our pension and post-retirement benefit plans footnote as the basis to retroactively apply this standard.



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In addition, under the new guidance, only the service cost component of net benefit cost is eligible for capitalization (e.g., as part of inventory or property, plant, and equipment). We continue to capitalize these costs into property, plant and equipment.

However, the FERC, which establishes the regulatory accounting practices for rate-regulated entities, issued guidance that permits such entities the option to continue to capitalize non-service benefit costs for regulatory purposes. Since the accounting guidelines by the FERC are typically followed by our state regulatory authorities, for U.S. GAAP reporting purposes, we are prospectively deferring into a regulatory asset the portion of non-service components of net periodic benefit cost that are capitalizable for regulatory purposes.

•

Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in A Hosting Arrangement That Is A Service Contract

- The new guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred for these contracts with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). We elected to early adopt the new guidance on a prospective basis effective October 1, 2018. Accordingly, we will capitalize the up-front costs incurred for cloud computing arrangements had they been capitalizable in a similar on-premise software solution.

•

Disclosures of Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

- As of September 30, 2019, we elected to early adopt the new guidance, issued by the FASB in August 2018, that modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The guidance removes the disclosure requirements for the amounts of gain/loss and prior service cost/credit amortization expected in the following year and the disclosure of the effect of a one-percentage-point change in the health care cost trend rate, among other changes. The guidance adds certain disclosures including the weighted average interest crediting rate for cash balance plans and a narrative description for the significant change in gains and losses as well as any other significant change in the plan obligations or assets. The adoption of this new guidance impacted only our disclosures, see Note 8.

Accounting pronouncements that will be effective after fiscal 2019

In February 2016, the FASB issued a comprehensive new leasing standard that will require lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases, including operating leases, with an initial term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. Subsequently, the FASB issued practical expedients to 1) allow entities to not evaluate existing or expired land easements that were not previously accounted for as leases under the current guidance and 2) allow entities the option to adopt the standard and recognize a cumulative–effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption rather than applying the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the year of adoption. The new standard was effective for us beginning on October 1, 2019.

The impact of this change on our financial position is expected to be material and we will be required to make additional disclosures. We do not anticipate the adoption of this standard will have a material impact to our results of operations or cash flows. We adopted the following practical expedients and accounting policy elections:

•

land easements practical expedient under the provisions of ASU 2018-01, as described above,

•

package of three practical expedients described in ASC 842-10-65-1,

•

transition method practical expedient provided in ASU 2018-11, as described above,

•

lease and non-lease component accounting policy election accounted for as single component, and

•

short-term lease exemption to not apply Topic 842, as permitted.

We are implementing a new lease accounting system, which we will utilize to capture, track and account for lease data. The new system will also aid in automating the compilation of disclosure information. Additionally, we are implementing internal controls to adhere to the new accounting guidance and to facilitate in the preparation of financial information.

In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which will require credit losses on most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments to be measured using an expected credit loss model. Under this model, entities will estimate credit losses over the entire contractual term of the instrument from the date of initial recognition of that instrument. In contrast, current U.S. GAAP is based on an incurred loss model that delays recognition of credit losses until it is probable the loss has been incurred. The new guidance also introduces a new impairment recognition model for available-for-sale debt securities that will require credit losses for available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance account. The new standard will be effective for us beginning on October 1, 2020; early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Segment Information

As of

September 30, 2019

, we manage and review our consolidated operations through the following

two

reportable segments:

•

The

distribution

segment

is primarily comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in

eight

states.

•

The

pipeline and storage

segment

is comprised primarily of the pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline-Texas division and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana.

Prior to disposition, the natural gas marketing segment, which was comprised of our natural gas marketing business, was also a reportable segment.

Our determination of reportable segments considers the strategic operating units under which we manage sales of various products and services to customers. Although our distribution segment operations are geographically dispersed, they are aggregated and reported as a single segment as each natural gas distribution division has similar economic characteristics. In addition, because the pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos Pipeline-Texas division and our natural gas transmission operations in Louisiana have similar economic characteristics, they have been aggregated and reported as a single segment.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. We evaluate performance based on net income or loss of the respective operating units. We allocate interest and pension expense to the pipeline and storage segment; however, there is no debt or pension liability recorded on the pipeline and storage segment balance sheet. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated; however, we have not eliminated intercompany profits when such amounts are probable of recovery under the affiliates’ rate regulation process. Income taxes are allocated to each segment as if each segment’s income taxes were calculated on a separate return basis.

Income statements and capital expenditures by segment are shown in the following tables.

Earnings Per Share

We use the two-class method of computing earnings per share because we have participating securities in the form of non-vested restricted stock units with a nonforfeitable right to dividend equivalents, for which vesting is predicated solely on the passage of time. The calculation of earnings per share using the two-class method excludes income attributable to these participating securities from the numerator and excludes the dilutive impact of those shares from the denominator.

Basic weighted average shares outstanding is calculated based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. Also, this calculation includes fully vested stock awards that have not yet been issued as common stock. Additionally, the weighted average shares outstanding for diluted EPS includes the incremental effects of the forward sale agreements, discussed in Note

1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan

In August 1998, the Board of Directors approved and adopted the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which became effective in October 1998 after approval by our shareholders. The LTIP is a comprehensive, long-term incentive compensation plan providing for discretionary awards of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, bonus stock, time-lapse restricted stock, time-lapse restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and stock units to certain employees and non-employee directors of the Company and our subsidiaries. The objectives of this plan include attracting and retaining the best available personnel, providing for additional performance incentives and promoting our success by providing employees with the opportunity to acquire our common stock.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

We record deferred gains (losses) in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to available-for-sale debt securities and interest rate agreement cash flow hedges. Deferred gains (losses) for our available-for-sale debt securities are recognized in earnings upon settlement, while deferred gains (losses) related to our interest rate agreement cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings as a component of interest charges, as they are amortized.

The following tables provide the components of our accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) balances, net of the related tax effects allocated to each component of other comprehensive income (loss).

Available-for-sale securities reported in fiscal 2018 include both debt and equity securities, while fiscal 2019 includes only debt securities. See Note 2 for further discussion regarding our adoption of the new accounting standard.

Retirement and Post-Retirement Employee Benefit Plans

We have both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit plans that together cover most of our employees. We also maintain post-retirement plans that provide health care benefits to retired employees. Finally, we sponsor a defined contribution plan that covers substantially all employees. These plans are discussed in further detail below.

As a rate regulated entity, most of our net periodic pension and other postretirement benefits costs are recoverable through our rates over a period of up to


years. A portion of these costs is capitalized into our rate base or deferred as a regulatory asset or liability. The remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense or other non-

operating expense.

Additionally, the amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost that have been recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities are as follows:

Defined Benefit Plans

Employee Pension Plan

As of

September 30, 2019

, we maintained one defined benefit plan, the Atmos Energy Corporation Pension Account Plan (the Plan).  The assets of the Plan are held within the Atmos Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust (the Master Trust).  The Plan is a cash balance pension plan that was established effective January 1999 and covers most of the employees of Atmos Energy that were hired on or before September 30, 2010.  The plan was closed to new participants effective October 1, 2010.

Opening account balances were established for participants as of January 1999 equal to the present value of their respective accrued benefits under the pension plans which were previously in effect as of December 31, 1998. The Plan credits an allocation to each participant’s account at the end of each year according to a formula based on the participant’s age, service and total pay (excluding incentive pay). In addition, at the end of each year, a participant’s account is credited with interest on the employee’s prior year account balance. Participants are fully vested in their account balances after

three years

of service and may choose to receive their account balances as a lump sum or an annuity.

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, including the funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future.

During fiscal


and


we contributed

$

8.5

million

and

$

7.0

million

in cash to the Plan to achieve a desired level of funding while maximizing the tax deductibility of this payment. Based upon market conditions at

September 30, 2019

, the current funded position of the Plan and the funding requirements under the PPA, we do not anticipate a minimum required contribution for fiscal


. However, we may consider whether a voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain funding levels.

We make investment decisions and evaluate performance of the assets in the Master Trust on a medium-term horizon of at least

three

to

five years

. We also consider our current financial status when making recommendations and decisions regarding the Master Trust’s assets. Finally, we strive to ensure the Master Trust’s assets are appropriately invested to maintain an acceptable level of risk and meet the Master Trust’s long-term asset investment policy adopted by the Board of Directors.

To achieve these objectives, we invest the Master Trust’s assets in equity securities, fixed income securities, interests in commingled pension trust funds, other investment assets and cash and cash equivalents. Investments in equity securities are diversified among the market’s various subsectors in an effort to diversify risk and maximize returns. Fixed income securities are invested in investment grade securities. Cash equivalents are invested in securities that either are short term (less than 180 days) or readily convertible to cash with modest risk.

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans

We have three nonqualified supplemental plans which provide additional pension, disability and death benefits to our officers, division presidents and certain other employees of the Company.

The first plan is referred to as the Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan (SEBP) and covers our officers, division presidents and certain other employees of the Company who were employed on or before August 12, 1998.  The SEBP is a defined benefit arrangement which provides a benefit equal to


percent of covered compensation under which benefits paid from the underlying qualified defined benefit plan are an offset to the benefits under the SEBP.

In August 1998, we adopted the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) (formerly known as the Performance-Based Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan), which covers all officers or division presidents selected to participate in the plan between August 12, 1998 and August 5, 2009 and any corporate officer who was appointed to the Management Committee  through December 31, 2015.  The SERP is a defined benefit arrangement which provides a benefit equal to


percent of



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

covered compensation under which benefits paid from the underlying qualified defined benefit plan are an offset to the benefits under the SERP.

Effective August 5, 2009, we adopted a new defined benefit Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the 2009 SERP), for corporate officers, division presidents or any other employees selected at the discretion of the Board. Under the 2009 SERP, a nominal account has been established for each participant, to which the Company contributes at the end of each calendar year an amount equal to

ten

percent (


percent for members of the Management Committee appointed on or after January 1, 2016) of the total of each participant’s base salary and cash incentive compensation earned during each prior calendar year, beginning December 31, 2009. The benefits vest after

Postretirement Benefits

We sponsor the Retiree Medical Plan for Retirees and Disabled Employees of Atmos Energy Corporation (the Atmos Retiree Medical Plan). This plan provides medical and prescription drug protection to all qualified participants based on their date of retirement. The Atmos Retiree Medical Plan provides different levels of benefits depending on the level of coverage chosen by the participants and the terms of predecessor plans; however, we generally pay


percent of the projected net claims and administrative costs and participants pay the remaining


percent. Effective January 1, 2015, for employees who had not met the participation requirements by September 30, 2009, the contribution rates for the Company are limited to a

three

percent cost increase in claims and administrative costs each year, with the participant responsible for the additional costs.

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount in accordance with the requirements of ERISA. However, additional voluntary contributions are made annually as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future. We expect to contribute between

We maintain a formal investment policy with respect to the assets in our postretirement benefits plan to ensure the assets funding the postretirement benefit plan are appropriately invested to maintain an acceptable level of risk. We also consider our current financial status when making recommendations and decisions regarding the postretirement benefits plan.

We currently invest the assets funding our postretirement benefit plan in diversified investment funds which consist of common stocks, preferred stocks and fixed income securities. The diversified investment funds may invest up to

percent of eligible compensation, as defined by the Plan, not to exceed the maximum allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. New participants are automatically enrolled in the Plan at a contribution rate of

four

percent of eligible compensation, from which they may opt out. We match


percent of a participant’s contributions, limited to

four

percent of the participant’s salary. Participants are eligible to receive matching contributions after completing

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Restricted Stock Units Award Grants

As noted above, the LTIP provides for discretionary awards of restricted stock units to help attract, retain and reward employees of Atmos Energy and its subsidiaries. Certain of these awards vest based upon the passage of time and other awards vest based upon the passage of time and the achievement of specified performance targets. The fair value of the awards granted is based on the market price of our stock at the date of grant. We estimate forfeitures using our historical forfeiture rate. The associated expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. We use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements for the vesting of restricted stock units.

Employees who are granted time-lapse restricted stock units under our LTIP have a nonforfeitable right to dividend equivalents that are paid at the same rate and at the same time at which they are paid on shares of stock without restrictions. Time-lapse restricted stock units contain only a service condition that the employee recipients render continuous services to the Company for a period of

three years

from the date of grant, except for accelerated vesting in the event of death, disability, change of control of the Company or termination without cause (with certain exceptions). There are no performance conditions required to be met for employees to be vested in time-lapse restricted stock units.

Employees who are granted performance-based restricted stock units under our LTIP have a forfeitable right to dividend equivalents that accrue at the same rate at which they are paid on shares of stock without restrictions. Dividend equivalents on the performance-based restricted stock units are paid either in cash or in the form of shares upon the vesting of the award. Performance-based restricted stock units contain a service condition that the employee recipients render continuous services to the Company for a period of

three years

from the beginning of the applicable three-year performance period, except for accelerated vesting in the event of death, disability, change of control of the Company or termination without cause (with certain exceptions) and a performance condition based on a cumulative earnings per share target amount.

Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation and Environmental Matters

In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings. For such matters, we record liabilities when they are considered probable and estimable, based on currently available facts, our historical experience and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the liability in the future.  While the outcome of these proceedings is uncertain and a loss in excess of the amount we have accrued is possible though not reasonably estimable, it is the opinion of management that any amounts exceeding the accruals will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

We maintain liability insurance for various risks associated with the operation of our natural gas pipelines and facilities, including for property damage and bodily injury. These liability insurance policies generally require us to be responsible for the first

$

million

(self-insured retention) of each incident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating an incident that occurred at a Dallas, Texas residence on February 23, 2018 that resulted in one fatality and injuries to four other residents. Together with the RRC and the PHMSA, Atmos Energy is a party to the investigation and in that capacity is working closely with the NTSB to help determine the cause of this incident.

On

March 29, 2018

, a civil action was filed in Dallas, Texas against Atmos Energy in response to the February 23rd incident. In May 2019, the parties resolved the civil action to their mutual satisfaction subject to our self-insured retention noted above.

We are a party to various other litigation and environmental-related matters or claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business. While the results of such litigation and response actions to such environmental-related matters or claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we continue to believe the final outcome of such litigation and matters or claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Purchase Commitments

Our distribution and pipeline and storage segments maintain supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to

one year

. Commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices. Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract.

Our Mid-Tex Division maintains a limited number of long-term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at prices indexed to natural gas trading hubs.  At

Impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "TCJA") was signed into law. As a result of the implementation of the TCJA, we recognized a

$

158.8

million

income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended September 30, 2018 related to a change in deferred taxes that were not related to our cost of service ratemaking. The change in deferred taxes related to our cost of service ratemaking (referred to as excess deferred taxes) was reclassified into a regulatory liability and will be returned to ratepayers in accordance with regulatory requirements. As of

September 30, 2019

and


, this liability totaled

$

726.3

million

and

$

744.9

million

.

We have worked and continue to work with our regulators in each jurisdiction to fully incorporate the effects of the TCJA into customer bills. As of

September 30, 2019

, we have received approval from regulators to update our cost of service rates to reflect the decrease in the statutory income tax rate in all of our service areas.

Regulators in all of our service areas issued accounting orders that required us to establish, effective January 1, 2018, a separate regulatory liability for the difference in taxes included in our rates that were calculated based on a


%

statutory income tax rate and rates based on the new


%

statutory income tax rate until the new rates could be established. As of

September 30, 2019

, we received approval from most of our regulators to return these liabilities to customers. This regulatory liability totaled

$

5.2

million

and

$

22.5

million

as of

September 30, 2019

and


.

As of

September 30, 2019

, we received approval from regulators to return excess deferred taxes in most of our jurisdictions in accordance with regulatory proceedings on a provisional basis over periods ranging from


to


years. In our remaining jurisdictions, the treatment of the effects of the TCJA in rates is being addressed in ongoing or will be addressed in future regulatory proceedings.

The SEC issued guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118), which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a one-year measurement period, similar to the measurement period in accounting for business combinations. The Company recorded provisional amounts for the income tax effects of the TCJA for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. Although the Company no longer considers the accounting effects of the TCJA to be provisional under SAB 118, many aspects of the TCJA remain unclear and its impact on the Company's income tax balances may change following further interpretation of TCJA provisions by issuance of U.S. Treasury regulations or guidance from the Internal Revenue Service.  We continue to monitor and assess the accounting implications of the TCJA developments on the consolidated financial statements.


.

Financial Instruments

We currently use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and in the past have also used financial instruments to mitigate interest rate risk. Our financial instruments do not contain any credit-risk-related or other contingent features that could cause accelerated payments when our financial instruments are in net liability positions.



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As discussed in Note


and Note


, we report our financial instruments as risk management assets and liabilities, each of which is classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument.

The following table shows the fair values of our risk management assets and liabilities at

September 30, 2019

and


.

Commodity Risk Management Activities

Our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms essentially insulate our

distribution

segment from commodity price risk; however, our customers are exposed to the effects of volatile natural gas prices. We manage this exposure through a combination of physical storage, fixed-price forward contracts and financial instruments, primarily over-the-counter swap and option contracts, in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season.

Our

distribution

gas supply department is responsible for executing this segment’s commodity risk management activities in conformity with regulatory requirements. In jurisdictions where we are permitted to mitigate commodity price risk through financial instruments, the relevant regulatory authorities may establish the level of heating season gas purchases that can be hedged. Historically, if the regulatory authority does not establish this level, we seek to hedge between


and


percent

of anticipated heating season gas purchases using financial instruments. For the


-


heating season (generally October through March), in the jurisdictions where we are permitted to utilize financial instruments, we hedged approximately


percent

, or approximately

18.9

Bcf of the winter flowing gas requirements at a weighted average cost of approximately

$

2.86

per Mcf. We have not designated these financial instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.

Interest Rate Risk Management Activities

In fiscal 2014 and 2015, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to effectively fix the Treasury yield component associated with

$


million

of the anticipated issuance of

$


million

unsecured senior notes in fiscal 2019.  These notes were issued as planned in March 2019 and we settled the swaps with the payment of

$

90.1

million

.  Because the swaps were effective, the realized loss was recorded as a component of AOCI and is being recognized as a component of interest charges over the 30-year life of the senior notes.

As of September 30, 2019, we had

$

114.7

million

of net realized losses in AOCI associated with the settlement of financial instruments used to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing various issuances of long-term debt and senior notes, which will be recognized as a component of interest charges over the life of the associated notes from the date of settlement. The remaining amortization periods for these settled amounts extend through fiscal 2049.

Quantitative Disclosures Related to Financial Instruments

The following tables present detailed information concerning the impact of financial instruments on our consolidated balance sheet and statements of comprehensive income.

As of

September 30, 2019

, our financial instruments were comprised of both long and short commodity positions. A long position is a contract to purchase the commodity, while a short position is a contract to sell the commodity. As of

September 30, 2019

, we had

24,270

MMcf of net long commodity contracts outstanding. These contracts have not been designated as hedges.

Deferred gains (losses) recorded in AOCI associated with our interest rate agreements are recognized in earnings as they are amortized over the terms of the underlying debt instruments.

The following amounts, net of deferred taxes, represent the expected recognition in earnings, as of

September 30, 2019

, of the deferred losses recorded in AOCI associated with our financial instruments, based upon the fair values of these financial instruments at the date of settlement.

Financial Instruments Not Designated as Hedges

As discussed above, commodity contracts which are used in our distribution segment are not designated as hedges. However, there is no earnings impact on our distribution segment as a result of the use of these financial instruments because the gains and losses arising from the use of these financial instruments are recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as a component of purchased gas cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and recognized in revenue. Accordingly, the impact of these financial instruments is excluded from this presentation.


.

Fair Value Measurements

We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). We record cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable at carrying value, which substantially approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. For other financial assets and liabilities, we primarily use quoted market prices and other observable market pricing information to minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our measurements when determining fair value. The methods used to determine fair value for our assets and liabilities are fully described in Note


.

Fair value measurements also apply to the valuation of our pension and post-retirement plan assets. The fair value of these assets is presented in Note

Financial Instruments

The classification of our fair value measurements requires judgment regarding the degree to which market data are observable or corroborated by observable market data.

The following tables summarize, by level within the fair value hierarchy, our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of

September 30, 2019

and


. As required under authoritative accounting literature, assets and liabilities are categorized in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(1)

Our Level 2 measurements consist of over-the-counter options and swaps, which are valued using a market-based approach in which observable market prices are adjusted for criteria specific to each instrument, such as the strike price, notional amount or basis differences, municipal and corporate bonds, which are valued based on the most recent available quoted market prices and money market funds which are valued at cost.

(2)

Our investments in bonds are considered available-for-sale debt securities in accordance with current accounting guidance as described in Note 2.

At

September 30, 2019

million

and

$

31.5

million

. At

September 30, 2019

we maintained investments in bonds that have contractual maturity dates ranging from October 2019 through September 2022.

Other Fair Value Measures

In addition to the financial instruments above, we have several financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measures. These financial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt. The nonfinancial assets and liabilities include asset retirement obligations and pension and post-retirement plan assets. We record cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt at carrying value. For cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, we consider carrying value to materially approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.

Our debt is recorded at carrying value. The fair value of our debt is determined using third party market value quotations, which are considered Level 1 fair value measurements for debt instruments with a recent, observable trade or Level 2 fair value

The operating results of our

natural gas marketing

reportable segment have been reported on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as income from discontinued operations, net of income tax for the year ended September 30, 2017.  Accordingly, expenses related to allocable general corporate overhead and interest expense are not included in these results.  The decision to report this segment as a discontinued operation was predicated, in part, on the following qualitative and quantitative factors:  1) the disposal resulted in the company becoming a fully regulated entity; 2) the fact that an entire reportable segment was disposed and 3) the fact the disposed segment represented in excess of 30 percent of consolidated revenues over the last five fiscal years.

The tables below set forth selected financial information related to discontinued operations. Operating expenses include operation and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense and taxes, other than income.

The following table presents statement of comprehensive income data related to discontinued operations.

ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Significant Accounting Policies Related to Discontinued Operations

Except as noted below, AEM adhered to the same Significant Accounting Policies as described in Note 2.

Revenue recognition

— We adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective approach so AEM's revenue recognition was not impacted by the adoption of the new standard. Operating revenues for our natural gas marketing segment were recognized in the period in which actual volumes were transported and storage services were provided. Operating revenues for our natural gas marketing segment and the associated carrying value of natural gas inventory (inclusive of storage costs) were recognized when we sold the gas and physically delivered it to our customers. Operating revenues include realized gains and losses arising from the settlement of financial instruments used in our natural gas marketing activities.

Gas stored underground

— Gas stored underground was comprised of natural gas injected into storage to conduct the operations of the natural gas marketing segment. Our natural gas marketing segment utilized the average cost method; however, most of this inventory was hedged and was therefore reported at fair value at the end of each month.

Property, plant and equipment

— Natural gas marketing property, plant and equipment was stated at cost. Depreciation was generally computed on the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes based upon estimated useful lives ranging from


to


years.

Financial instruments and hedging activities

— In our

natural gas marketing

segment, we previously designated most of the natural gas inventory held by this operating segment as the hedged item in a fair-value hedge. This inventory was marked to market at the end of each month based on the Gas Daily index, with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in purchased gas cost, which is reflected in income from discontinued operations in the period of change. The financial instruments associated with this natural gas inventory were designated as fair-value hedges and were marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in purchased gas cost in the period of change. We elected to exclude this spot/forward differential for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fair-value hedges.

Additionally, we previously elected to treat fixed-price forward contracts used in our

natural gas marketing

segment to deliver natural gas as normal purchases and normal sales. As such, these deliveries were recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. Financial instruments used to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with these contracts were designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at indexed prices. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses on these open financial instruments were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and were recognized in earnings as a component of purchased gas cost which is reflected in income from discontinued operations when the hedged volumes were sold.

Gains and losses from hedge ineffectiveness were recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. Fair value and cash flow hedge ineffectiveness arising from natural gas market price differences between the locations of the hedged inventory and the delivery location specified in the financial instruments is referred to as basis ineffectiveness. Ineffectiveness arising from changes in the fair value of the fair value hedges due to changes in the difference between the spot price and the futures price, as well as the difference between the timing of the settlement of the futures and the valuation of the underlying physical commodity is referred to as timing ineffectiveness. Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred, is reported as a component of purchased gas cost reflected in income from discontinued operations for the year ended September 30,


.

Our

natural gas marketing

segment also utilized master netting agreements with significant counterparties that allow us to offset gains and losses arising from financial instruments that would be settled in cash with gains and losses arising from financial instruments that could be settled with the physical commodity. Assets and liabilities from risk management activities, as well as accounts receivable and payable, reflect the master netting agreements in place. Additionally, the accounting guidance for master netting arrangements requires us to include the fair value of cash collateral or the obligation to return cash in the amounts that have been netted under master netting agreements used to offset gains and losses arising from financial instruments.

Fair Value Measurements

— Our discontinued operations used the same fair value measurement policies as described in Note 2 for our continuing operations. Level 1 measurements included primarily exchange-traded financial instruments and gas stored underground that was been designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge. Within our

natural gas marketing

operations, we utilized a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point between the bid and ask prices), as permitted under current accounting standards. Values derived from these sources reflected the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed. Level 2 measurements primarily consisted of non-exchange-traded financial instruments, such as over-the-counter options and swaps.

$


million

364-day bilateral credit facility that was scheduled to expire on September 30, 2017.  In connection with the sale of AEM, both facilities were terminated on January 3, 2017.

Commodity Risk Management Activities

Our discontinued

natural gas marketing

segment was exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas through the purchase, sale and delivery of natural gas to its customers at competitive prices. Through December 31, 2016, we managed our exposure to such risks through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments, including futures, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties. Effective January 1, 2017, as a result of the sale of AEM, these activities were discontinued.

Due to the sale of AEM, we determined that the cash flows associated with our natural gas marketing commodity cash flow hedges were no longer probable of occurring; therefore, we discontinued hedge accounting as of December 31, 2016. As a result, we reclassified the gain in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with the commodity contracts into earnings as a reduction of purchased gas cost and recognized a pre-tax gain of

$

10.6

million

, which is included in income from discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended September 30, 2017.

The Company's other risk management activities are discussed in Note 14.

Impact of Financial Instruments on the Statement of Comprehensive Income

Hedge ineffectiveness for our

natural gas marketing

segment was recorded as a component of purchased gas cost, which is included in discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, and primarily results from differences in the location and timing of the derivative instrument and the hedged item.

For the years ended

September 30, 2017

, we recognized a gain arising from fair value and cash flow hedge ineffectiveness of

$

3.4

million

. Additional information regarding ineffectiveness recognized in the statement of comprehensive income is included in the tables below.

Fair Value Hedges

The impact of our

natural gas marketing

segment commodity contracts designated as fair value hedges and the related hedged item on the results of discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended

September 30, 2017

is presented below.

Basis ineffectiveness arises from natural gas market price differences between the locations of the hedged inventory and the delivery location specified in the hedge instruments. Timing ineffectiveness arises due to changes in the difference between the spot price and the futures price, as well as the difference between the timing of the settlement of the futures and the valuation of the underlying physical commodity. As the commodity contract nears the settlement date, spot-to-forward price differences should converge, which should reduce or eliminate the impact of this ineffectiveness on purchased gas cost.

Cash Flow Hedges

The impact of our natural gas marketing segment cash flow hedges on our consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended

September 30, 2017

is presented below. Note that this presentation does not reflect the financial impact arising from the hedged physical transactions. Therefore, this presentation is not indicative of the economic margin we realized when the underlying physical and financial transactions were settled.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Financial Instruments Not Designated as Hedges

The impact of financial instruments that have not been designated as hedges on our consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended

was a decrease in purchased gas cost reflected in income from discontinued operations of

$

6.8

million

, which is included in discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Note that this presentation does not reflect the expected gains or losses arising from the underlying physical transactions associated with these financial instruments. Therefore, this presentation is not indicative of the economic margin we realized when the underlying physical and financial transactions were settled.


.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to us if a customer fails to perform its contractual obligations. We engage in transactions for the purchase and sale of products and services with major companies in the energy industry and with industrial, commercial, residential and municipal energy consumers. These transactions principally occur in the southern and midwestern regions of the United States. We believe that this geographic concentration does not contribute significantly to our overall exposure to credit risk. Credit risk associated with trade accounts receivable for the distribution segment is mitigated by the large number of individual customers and the diversity in our customer base. The credit risk for our other segment is not significant.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Atmos Energy Corporation

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Atmos Energy Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of

September 30, 2019

, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Atmos Energy Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

September 30, 2019

, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2019 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated

November 12, 2019

expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
