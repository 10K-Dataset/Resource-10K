GLOSSARY OF KEY TERMS



PART I

The terms “we,” “our,” “us,”
“Atmos” and “Atmos Energy” refer to Atmos
Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context
suggests otherwise.

ITEM 1.

Business

Overview

Atmos Energy Corporation, (AEC), headquartered in Dallas, Texas,
is engaged primarily in the natural gas utility business as well
as other natural gas nonutility businesses. We are one of the
country’s largest natural-gas-only distributors based on
number of customers and one of the largest intrastate pipeline
operators in Texas based upon miles of pipe. As of
September 30, 2005 we distributed natural gas through sales
and transportation arrangements to approximately
3.2 million residential, commercial, public authority and
industrial customers through our seven regulated utility
divisions, which covered service areas in 12 states. Our
primary service areas are located in Colorado, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. We have more
limited service areas in Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri and
Virginia. In addition, we transport natural gas for others
through our distribution system.

Through our nonutility businesses, we primarily provide natural
gas management and marketing services to municipalities, other
local gas distribution companies and industrial customers in
22 states and natural gas transportation and storage
services to certain of our utility divisions and to third
parties.

Operating Segments

Our operations are divided into four segments:

Strategy

Our overall strategy is to:

•

deliver superior shareholder value

•

improve the quality and consistency of earnings growth, while
    operating our natural gas utility and nonutility businesses
    exceptionally well and

•

enhance and strengthen a culture built on our core values.

Over the last five years, we have grown through several
acquisitions, including our acquisition in April 2001 of the
remaining 55 percent interest in Woodward Marketing, L.L.C.
that we did not already own, our acquisition in July 2001 of the
assets of Louisiana Gas Service Company, our acquisition in
December 2002 of Mississippi Valley Gas Company (MVG) and
our acquisition on October 1, 2004 of the natural gas
distribution and pipeline operations of TXU Gas Company (TXU
Gas).

The TXU Gas operations we acquired are regulated businesses
engaged in the purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of
natural gas in the north-central, eastern and western parts of
Texas. Through these newly acquired operations, we provide gas
distribution services to approximately 1.5 million
residential and business customers in Texas, including the
Dallas/ Fort Worth metropolitan area. We also now own and
operate a system consisting of 6,162 miles of gas
transmission and gathering lines and five underground storage
reservoirs, all within Texas.



The purchase price for the TXU Gas acquisition was approximately
$1.9 billion (after closing adjustments and before
transaction costs and expenses), which we paid in cash. We
acquired approximately $112 million of working capital and
did not assume any indebtedness of TXU Gas in connection with
the acquisition. TXU Gas retained certain assets, provided for
the repayment of all of its indebtedness and redeemed all of its
preferred stock prior to closing and retained and agreed to pay
certain other liabilities under the terms of the acquisition
agreement.

We funded the purchase price for the TXU Gas acquisition with
approximately $235.7 million in net proceeds from our
offering of approximately 9.9 million shares of common
stock, which we completed on July 19, 2004, and
approximately $1.7 billion in net proceeds from our
issuance on October 1, 2004 of commercial paper backstopped
by a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement, which we
entered into on September 24, 2004 for bridge financing for
the TXU Gas acquisition. In October 2004, we repaid the
commercial paper used to fund the acquisition through the
issuance of senior unsecured notes on October 22, 2004
which generated net proceeds of approximately $1.39 billion
and the sale of 16.1 million shares of common stock on
October 27, 2004, which generated net proceeds of
approximately $382.5 million before other offering costs.

We have experienced over 20 consecutive years of increasing
dividends and earnings growth after giving effect to our
acquisitions. We have achieved this record of growth while
operating our utility operations efficiently by managing our
operating and maintenance expenses, leveraging our technology,
such as our 24-hour call centers, to achieve more efficient
operations, focusing on regulatory rate proceedings to increase
revenue as our costs increase and mitigating weather-related
risks through weather-normalized rates in many of our service
areas. Additionally, we have strengthened our nonutility
business by increasing gross profit margins, actively pursuing
opportunities to increase the amount of storage available to us
and expanding commercial opportunities on our intrastate Texas
pipeline.

Our core values include focusing on our employees and customers
while conducting our business with honesty and integrity. We
continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing
communications with our employees and enhanced employee training.

Utility Segment Overview

We operate our utility segment through the following seven
regulated natural gas utility divisions:

Our natural gas utility distribution business is seasonal and
dependent on weather conditions in our service areas. Gas sales
to residential and commercial customers are greater during the
winter months than during the remainder of the year. The volumes
of gas sales during the winter months will vary with the
temperatures during these months. The seasonal nature of our
sales to residential and commercial customers is partially
offset by our sales in the spring and summer months to our
agricultural customers in Texas, Colorado and Kansas who use
natural gas to operate irrigation equipment.

In addition to weather, our financial results are affected by
the cost of natural gas and economic conditions in the areas
that we serve. Higher gas costs, which we are generally able to
pass through to our customers under purchased gas adjustment
clauses, may cause customers to conserve, or, in the case of



industrial customers, to use alternative energy sources. Higher
gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable
collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense and may
require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities
resulting in higher interest expense.

The effect of weather that is above or below normal is partially
offset through weather normalization adjustments, or WNA, as
approved by the regulators in certain of our service areas. WNA
allows us to increase customers’ bills to offset lower gas
usage when weather is warmer than normal and decrease
customers’ bills to offset higher gas usage when weather is
colder than normal. As of September 30, 2005 we had WNA in
the following service areas for the following periods, which
covered approximately 1.0 million of our meters in service:

(1)

Beginning in October 2005, the WNA period for Mississippi will
    be November — April.

(2)

Effective beginning in July 2005.

Our Mid-Tex Division does not have WNA. However, their
operations benefit from a rate structure that combines a monthly
customer charge with a declining block rate schedule to
partially mitigate the impact of warmer-than-normal weather on
revenue. The combination of the monthly customer charge and the
customer billing under the first block of the declining block
rate schedule provides for the recovery of most of our fixed
costs for such operations under most weather conditions.
However, this rate structure is not as beneficial during periods
where weather is significantly warmer than normal.

Our natural gas supply comes from a variety of third party
providers and from gas held in storage. We anticipate that the
natural gas supply for the upcoming winter heating season will
be provided by a variety of suppliers, including independent
producers, marketers and pipeline companies, in addition to
withdrawals of gas from storage. Additionally, the natural gas
supply for our Mid-Tex Division includes peaking and spot
purchase agreements. We also contract for storage service in
underground storage facilities on many of the interstate
pipelines serving us. We estimate the peak-day availability of
natural gas supply from long-term contracts, short-term
contracts and withdrawals from underground storage to be
approximately 4.2 Bcf. The peak-day demand for our utility
operations in fiscal 2005 was on December 23, 2004, when
sales to customers reached approximately 3.5 Bcf.

Supply arrangements are contracted from our suppliers on a firm
basis with various terms at market prices. The firm supply
consists of both base load and swing supply quantities. Base
load quantities are those that flow at a constant level
throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the
flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or
decreases in requirements related to weather conditions. Except
for local production purchases, we select suppliers through a
competitive bidding process by requesting proposals from
suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable
service. We select these suppliers based on their ability to
deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt
points at the lowest cost. Major suppliers during fiscal 2005
were Anadarko Energy Services, BP Energy Company, Chevron
Corporation, ConocoPhillips Company, Cross Timbers Energy
Services, Inc., Devon Gas Services, L.P., Enbridge Marketing
(US) L.P., Oneok Energy Services Company, L.P., Tenaska
Marketing and Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC, our natural gas
marketing subsidiary.



The combination of base load, peaking and spot purchase
agreements, coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage,
allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather, which
minimizes our need to enter into firm commitments.

Also, to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers, we
have the ability, and have exercised our right, to curtail
deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible
contracts, applicable state statutes or regulations. Our
customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily
indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market
demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors
such as the physical limitations of gathering, storage and
transmission systems, the duration and severity of cold weather,
the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers, the ability
to purchase additional supplies on a short-term basis and
actions by federal and state regulatory authorities. Curtailment
rights provide us the flexibility to meet the human-needs
requirements of our customers on a firm basis. Priority
allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies, as
well as other factors beyond our control, may affect our ability
to meet the demands of our customers. We anticipate no problems
with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers.

We receive gas deliveries for all of our utility divisions,
except for our Mid-Tex Division, through 37 pipeline
transportation companies, both interstate and intrastate, to
satisfy our natural gas needs. The pipeline transportation
agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline
no-notice” storage service which provides for daily
balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing
supplies. These agreements have been negotiated with the
shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of
first refusal. The natural gas supply for our Mid-Tex Division
is delivered by our Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division,
which was formed from the natural gas transmission and storage
operations that we acquired in the TXU Gas acquisition.

The following is a brief description of our seven natural gas
utility divisions. Additional information for our natural gas
utility divisions is presented under the caption “Operating
Statistics”.

Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division.

Our
Colorado-Kansas Division operates in Colorado, Kansas and the
southwestern corner of Missouri and is regulated by each
respective state’s public service commission with respect
to accounting, rates and charges, operating matters and the
issuance of securities. We operate under terms of non-exclusive
franchises granted by the various cities. Rates in our Kansas
service area are subject to WNA. The principal transporters of
the Colorado-Kansas Division’s gas supply requirements are
Colorado Interstate Gas Company, Northwest Pipeline, Public
Service Company of Colorado and Southern Star Central Pipeline.
Additionally, the Colorado-Kansas Division purchases substantial
volumes from producers that are connected directly to its
distribution system.

Atmos Energy Kentucky Division.

Our Kentucky Division
operates in Kentucky and is regulated by the Kentucky Public
Service Commission, which regulates utility services, rates,
issuance of securities and other matters. We operate in various
incorporated cities pursuant to non-exclusive franchises granted
by these cities. The sale of natural gas for use as vehicle fuel
in Kentucky is unregulated. We will operate under a
performance-based rate program through March 2006. Under the
performance-based program, we and our customers jointly share in
any actual gas cost savings achieved when compared to
pre-determined benchmarks. Our rates are also subject to WNA.
The Kentucky Division’s gas supply is delivered primarily
by Midwestern Pipeline, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, Texas
Gas Transmission LLC and Trunkline Gas Company.

Atmos Energy Louisiana Division.

Our Louisiana Division
operates in Louisiana and includes the operations of the
Louisiana Gas Service Company assets acquired in July 2001,
which serves the metropolitan area of Monroe and the suburban
areas of New Orleans, and our previously existing Trans
La Division, which serves western Louisiana. Our Louisiana
Division is regulated by the Louisiana Public Service Commission
(LPSC), which regulates utility services, rates and other
matters. We operate most of our service areas pursuant to a
non-exclusive franchise granted by the governing authority of
each area. Direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers
in Louisiana, who use gas for fuel or in manufacturing
processes, and sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel are exempt
from regulation and are recognized in our natural gas marketing
segment. The principal transporters of the Louisiana
Division’s gas supply requirements are Acadian Pipeline,



Gulf South, Louisiana Intrastate Gas Company, Texas Gas
Transmission LLC and Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline, Inc., a
subsidiary of Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC.

Atmos Energy Mid-States Division.

Our Mid-States Division
operates in Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Tennessee and
Virginia. In each of these states, our rates, services and
operations as a natural gas distribution company are subject to
general regulation by each state’s public service
commission. We operate in each community, where necessary, under
a franchise granted by the municipality for a fixed term of
years. In Tennessee and Georgia, we have WNA and a
performance-based rate program, which provides incentives for us
to find ways to lower costs and share the cost savings with our
customers. Beginning in July 2005, we have WNA in Virginia that
will cover the entire year. Our Mid-States Division is served by
13 interstate pipelines; however, the majority of the volumes
are transported through Columbia Gulf, East Tennessee Pipeline,
Southern Natural Gas and Tennessee Gas Pipeline.

Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division.

Our Mid-Tex Division,
which represents the distribution assets and operations that we
acquired from TXU Gas on October 1, 2004, includes natural
gas distribution operations that operate in the north-central,
eastern and western parts of Texas. The Mid-Tex Division
purchases, distributes and sells natural gas to approximately
1.5 million residential and business customers in
approximately 550 cities and towns, including the 11-county
Dallas/ Fort Worth metropolitan area. Under a May 2004 rate
filing, this division operates under a system-wide rate
structure along with the pipeline operations we acquired in the
acquisition. The governing body of each municipality we serve
has original jurisdiction over all utility rates, operations and
services within its city limits, except with respect to sales of
natural gas for vehicle fuel and agricultural use. We operate
pursuant to non-exclusive franchises granted by the
municipalities we serve, which are subject to renewal from time
to time. The Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) has
exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory
orders and ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive
original jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not
located within the limits of a municipality. This division does
not have WNA. However, our operations benefit from a declining
block rate structure that partially mitigates the impact of
warmer-than-normal weather on revenue. This rate structure is
not as beneficial during periods where weather is significantly
warmer than normal. The majority of this division’s
residential and business customers use natural gas for heating,
and their needs are directly affected by the mildness or
severity of the heating season.

At closing of the acquisition, TXU Gas and some of its
affiliates entered into transitional services agreements with us
to provide call center, meter reading, customer billing,
collections, information reporting, software, accounting,
treasury, administrative and other services to the Mid-Tex
Division. Some of these services were outsourced by TXU Gas to
Capgemini Energy L.P. However, on November 4, 2004, we
entered into an agreement with Capgemini Energy L.P. whereby we
took over the operations of the Waco, Texas call center on
April 1, 2005 and purchased from Capgemini Energy L.P. all
of the related call center assets on October 1, 2005. The
remaining transitional services agreements expired on
September 30, 2005 and were not renewed as we have
in-sourced all of these functions, effective October 1,
2005.

Atmos Energy Mississippi Division.

Our Atmos Energy
Mississippi Division (formerly known as Mississippi Valley Gas
Company Division), which was acquired in December 2002, operates
in Mississippi and is regulated by the Mississippi Public
Service Commission (MPSC) with respect to rates, services
and operations. We operate under non-exclusive franchises
granted by the municipalities we serve. Since the acquisition,
we have been operating under a rate structure that allows us,
over a five-year period, to recover a portion of our integration
costs associated with the acquisition and operations and
maintenance costs in excess of an agreed-upon benchmark. In
addition, we were required to file for rate adjustments based on
our expenses every six months. Effective October 1, 2005,
our rate design was modified to substitute the original
agreed-upon benchmark with a sharing mechanism to allow the
sharing of cost savings above an allowed return on equity level.
Further, we will move from a semi-annual filing process to an
annual filing process. We also have WNA in Mississippi. This
division’s gas supply is delivered by Gulf South Pipeline
Company, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, Southern Natural Gas
Company, Texas Eastern Transmission, Texas Gas
Transmission LLC, Trunkline Gas Co. LLC and Enbridge
Marketing LP.



Atmos Energy West Texas Division.

Our West Texas Division
operates in Texas in three primary service areas: the Amarillo
service area, the Lubbock service area and the West Texas
service area. Similar to our Mid-Tex Division, the governing
body of each municipality we serve has original jurisdiction
over all utility rates, operations and services within its city
limits, except with respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle
fuel and agricultural use. We operate pursuant to non-exclusive
franchises granted by the municipalities we serve, which are
subject to renewal from time to time. The RRC has exclusive
appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory orders and
ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive original
jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not located
within the limits of a municipality. During 2004, the West Texas
Division received approval from the City of Lubbock, Texas and
the 66 cities in our West Texas system, for WNA in these
service areas, which is effective October through May of each
year, beginning with the 2004-2005 winter heating season. We
also have WNA in our Amarillo service area. Our West Texas
Division receives transportation service from ONEOK Pipeline. In
addition, the West Texas Division purchases a significant
portion of its natural gas supply from Pioneer Natural
Resources, which is connected directly to our Amarillo, Texas,
distribution system.

Natural Gas Marketing Segment Overview

Our natural gas marketing and other nonutility segments, which
are organized under Atmos Energy Holdings, Inc. (AEH), have
operations in 22 states. Through September 30, 2003,
Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC, together with its wholly-owned
subsidiaries Woodward Marketing, L.L.C. and Trans Louisiana
Industrial Gas Company, Inc., comprised our natural gas
marketing segment. Effective October 1, 2003, our natural
gas marketing segment was reorganized. The operations of Atmos
Energy Marketing, L.L.C. and Trans Louisiana Industrial Gas
Company, Inc. were merged into Woodward Marketing, L.L.C., which
was renamed Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC (AEM).

We acquired a 45 percent interest in Woodward Marketing,
L.L.C. in July 1997 as a result of the merger of Atmos and
United Cities Gas Company, which had acquired that interest in
May 1995. In April 2001, we acquired the remaining
55 percent interest that we did not own for 1,423,193
restricted shares of our common stock.

AEM provides a variety of natural gas management services to
municipalities, natural gas utility systems and industrial
natural gas consumers primarily in the southeastern and
midwestern states and to our Kentucky, Louisiana and Mid-States
divisions. These services primarily consist of furnishing
natural gas supplies at fixed and market-based prices, contract
negotiation and administration, load forecasting, gas storage
acquisition and management services, transportation services,
peaking sales and balancing services, capacity utilization
strategies and gas price management through the use of
derivative products. We use proprietary and customer-owned
transportation and storage assets to provide the various
services our customers request. As a result, our revenues arise
from the types of commercial transactions we have structured
with our customers and include the value we extract by
optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or
control as well as revenues for services we deliver.

We participate in transactions in which we combine the natural
gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs
incurred to serve our customers. Additionally, we participate in
natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to capture the
pricing differences that occur over time. We purchase or sell
physical natural gas and then sell or purchase financial
contracts at a price sufficient to cover our carrying costs and
provide a gross profit margin. Through the use of transportation
and storage services and derivatives, we are able to capture
gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences
in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that
occur over time.

AEM’s management of natural gas requirements involves the
sale of natural gas and the management of storage and
transportation supplies under contracts with customers generally
having one to two year terms. AEM also sells natural gas to some
of its industrial customers on a delivered burner tip basis
under contract terms from 30 days to two years. At
September 30, 2005, AEM had a total of 558 industrial, 69
municipal and 210 other customers.



Pipeline and Storage Segment Overview

Our pipeline and storage segment consists of the regulated
pipeline and storage operations of the Atmos
Pipeline — Texas Division and the nonregulated
pipeline and storage operations of Atmos Pipeline and Storage,
LLC. The natural gas transmission and storage operations that we
acquired in the TXU Gas acquisition, which are operated in the
Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division, represent one of the
largest intrastate pipeline operations in Texas. The Atmos
Pipeline — Texas Division transports natural gas to
our Mid-Tex Division and for third parties. These operations
include interconnected natural gas transmission lines, five
underground storage reservoirs (including a salt dome facility)
and 24 compressor stations and related properties, all within
Texas. These operations may create additional gas marketing and
other opportunities for our non-regulated subsidiaries.

The gas distribution and transmission lines we acquired have
been constructed over lands of others pursuant to easements or
along public highways, streets and rights-of-way as permitted by
law. In addition to being heavily concentrated in the
established natural gas-producing areas of central, northern and
eastern Texas, the intrastate pipeline system we acquired also
extends into or near the major producing areas of the Texas Gulf
Coast and the Delaware and Val Verde Basins of West Texas. Nine
basins located in Texas are estimated to contain a substantial
portion of the nation’s remaining onshore natural gas
reserves. This pipeline system provides access to all of these
basins. We believe that we are well situated to receive large
volumes into this pipeline system at the major hubs, such as
Katy, Waha and Carthage as well as from storage facilities where
we maintain high delivery capabilities.

APS owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in
Kentucky and Louisiana. We also use these storage facilities to
reduce the need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to
meet customer demand during peak periods.

Other Nonutility Segment Overview

Our other nonutility segment consists primarily of the
operations of Atmos Energy Services, LLC (AES), and Atmos Power
Systems, Inc. which are wholly-owned by our subsidiary, Atmos
Energy Holdings, Inc. Through AES, we provide natural gas
management services to our utility operations, other than the
Mid-Tex Division. These services, which began on April 1,
2004, include aggregating and purchasing gas supply, arranging
transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering
the gas to our utility service areas at competitive prices in
exchange for revenues that are equal to the costs incurred to
provide those services. Through Atmos Power Systems, Inc., we
construct gas-fired electric peaking power-generating plants and
associated facilities and may enter into agreements to either
lease or sell these plants.

Through January 20, 2004, United Cities Propane Gas, Inc.,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Atmos Energy Holdings, Inc., owned
an approximate 19 percent membership interest in
U.S. Propane L.P. (USP), a joint venture formed in February
2000 with other utility companies to own a limited partnership
interest in Heritage Propane Partners, L.P. (Heritage), a
publicly-traded marketer of propane through a nationwide retail
distribution network. During fiscal 2004, we sold our interest
in USP and Heritage. As a result of these transactions, we no
longer have an interest in the propane business.

Ratemaking Activity

Overview

The method of determining regulated rates varies among the
states in which our natural gas utility divisions operate. The
regulators have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities
under their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of
customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to
earn a reasonable return on investment. Generally, each
regulatory authority reviews our rate request and establishes a
rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover
our costs of doing business and provide a reasonable return on
invested capital.

Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for
increases and decreases in our purchased gas cost through
purchased gas adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas adjustment
mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering
purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate
case to address all of the utility’s non-gas costs. These
mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities
recognize a particular type of expense, such as purchased gas
costs, that (i) is subject to significant price
fluctuations compared to the utility’s other costs,
(ii) represents a large component of the utility’s
cost of service and (iii) is generally outside the control
of the gas utility. There is no gross profit generated through
purchased gas adjustments, but they do provide a
dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or decreases in utility
gas costs. Although substantially all of our utility sales to
our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase,
utility gross profit (which is defined as operating revenues
less purchased gas cost) is generally not affected by
fluctuations in the cost of gas due to the purchased gas
adjustment mechanism. Additionally, certain jurisdictions have
introduced performance-based ratemaking adjustments to provide
incentives to natural gas utilities to minimize purchased gas
costs through improved storage management and use of financial
hedges to lock in gas costs. Under the performance-based
ratemaking adjustment, purchased gas costs savings are shared
between the utility and its customers.

The following table summarizes certain information regarding our
ratemaking jurisdictions.

Jurisdictional Rate Summary

See footnotes on the following page.



(1)

The rate base and authorized rate of return presented in this
    table are the rate base and rate of return from the last base
    rate case for each jurisdiction. These rate bases and rates of
    return are not necessarily indicative of current or future rate
    bases or rates of return.

(2)

A rate base, rate of return, return on equity or debt/equity
    ratio was not included in the respective state commission’s
    final decision.

(3)

The performance-based rate program provides incentives to
    natural gas utilities to minimize purchased gas costs by
    allowing the utility and its customers to share the purchased
    gas cost savings.

Recent Ratemaking Activity

Our current rate strategy focuses on addressing rate design and
regulatory lag issues. We are seeking rate designs that decouple
the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage
patterns due to weather related variability, declining use per
customer and energy conservation. Additionally, we are seeking
to stratify rates for low income households and to recover the
gas cost portion of our bad debt expense.

We are attempting to address regulatory lag issues by directing
discretionary capital spending to jurisdictions that permit us
to recover our investment in a more timely manner, working with
our regulators to eliminate regulatory lag in our jurisdictions
and filing rate cases on a more frequent basis to minimize the
regulatory lag to keep our actual returns more closely aligned
with our allowed returns.

Approximately 97 percent of our utility revenues in the
fiscal years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were
derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by
local or state authorities. Net annual



revenue increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling
$6.3 million, $16.2 million and $18.6 million
became effective in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 as summarized
below:

(1)

In 2003, the Texas Legislature approved the Gas Reliability
    Infrastructure Program (GRIP) which allows natural gas
    utilities the opportunity to include in their rate base annually
    approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year.
    Natural gas utilities who enter the program will be required to
    file a complete rate case at least once every five years.

(2)

In 2002, we submitted our 2001 rate stabilization filing and
    received tariff revisions which resulted in an increase in
    annual revenues of $0.5 million for our Trans
    La System and $15.3 million in our LGS System
    during the first 24-month period beginning in November 2002.
    Subsequent to the first 24-month period, adjusted rates have
    provided an increase in annual revenues of $0.4 million for
    our Trans La System and $11.9 million for our LGS
    System.

The MPSC required that we file for rate adjustments every six
    months. Through May 2005, rate filings were made in May and
    November of each year and the rate adjustments typically became
    effective in June and December. See further discussion under the
    recent ratemaking activity for our Atmos Energy Mississippi
    Division below.

Our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail
below.

Atmos Pipeline-Texas.

In December 2004, Atmos
Pipeline — Texas made a GRIP filing to include in rate
base approximately $12.0 million of pipeline capital
expenditures made by TXU Gas during calendar year 2003, which
should result in additional revenues of approximately
$1.8 million. The RRC approved this filing in March 2005.
These capital costs are being recovered through a monthly
customer charge that began in April 2005. The allowed rate of
return is 8.258 percent.

In September, 2005, Atmos Pipeline — Texas made a GRIP
filing to include in rate base approximately $10.6 million
of pipeline capital expenditures incurred during calendar year
2004. It is anticipated that $1.9 million in additional
annual revenue will be authorized through this filing. A
decision on this filing must be made by the RRC before
January 4, 2006.

Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division.

In July 2004, the
Colorado Public Utility Commission ordered us to issue a
one-time credit to our Colorado customers of $1.9 million.
The agreement was a result of an inquiry by the Colorado Office
of Consumer Counsel related to our earnings in Colorado. The
staff of the Colorado Public Utility Commission was also a party
to the agreement.

In May 2003, the Colorado-Kansas Division filed a rate case with
the Kansas Corporation Commission for approximately
$7.4 million in additional annual revenues. In January
2004, the Kansas Corporation Commission approved an agreement
that allowed a $2.5 million increase in our rates effective
March 1, 2004. Additionally, the agreement allowed us to
increase our monthly customer charges from $5 to $8, provided
that we would not file another full rate application prior to
September 1, 2005. WNA became effective in Kansas in
October 2003 in accordance with the Kansas Corporation
Commission’s ruling in May 2003.

Atmos Energy Louisiana Division.

During the second
quarter of 2005, the Louisiana Division implemented a rate
increase of $3.3 million in its LGS service area. This
increase resulted from our Rate Stabilization Clause filing in
2004 and is subject to refund, pending the final resolution of
that filing. As the rate increase is subject to refund, we have
not recognized the effects of this increase in our results of
operations during fiscal 2005.

During fiscal 2004, the Louisiana Public Service Commission
approved tariff revisions for our LGS System totaling
$0.2 million that became effective in October 2004.

In October 2002, Atmos received written notification from the
Executive Secretary of the LPSC asserting that a monthly
facilities fee of approximately $0.6 million charged since
July 2001 to Atmos by Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Atmos, pursuant to a contract between
the parties, was excessive. The Executive Secretary asserted
that all monthly facilities fees in excess of approximately
$0.1 million from July 2001 should be refunded to
ratepayers with interest. On October 8, 2003, the LPSC
unanimously voted to approve an agreement to allow us to charge
a facilities fee of approximately $0.5 million per month
(subject to future escalation) beginning November 1, 2003
for a period of 14 years. No retroactive adjustments were
required under this agreement.

In January and February 2002, our Louisiana Division submitted
its 2001 Rate Stabilization filings to the LPSC for the two gas
systems we operate in Louisiana. The LPSC audited the filings
and found our earnings to be deficient and that rate adjustments
were appropriate. Approved tariff revisions, which became
effective November 1, 2002, resulted in $15.3 million
in additional revenues per year for our LGS System and
$0.5 million for our Trans La System during the first
24-month period beginning in November 2002. Subsequent to the
first 24-month period, adjusted rates provided total annual
revenue increases of $11.9 million for our LGS System and
$0.4 million for our Trans La System. As a result of
the actions taken by the LPSC, we have decreased the overall
weather impact on our revenues in Louisiana, primarily through
increases in the fixed portion of customers’ monthly bills.

In 2001, in connection with its review of our acquisition of
Louisiana Gas Service, the LPSC approved a rate structure that
requires us to share with the customers of Louisiana Gas Service
cost savings that result from the acquisition. The shared cost
savings are the difference between operation and maintenance
expense in any future year and the 1998 normalized expense for
Louisiana Gas Service, indexed for inflation, annual



changes in labor costs and customer growth. Since
January 1, 2002, customers have been assured they will
receive annual savings, which will be indexed for inflation,
annual changes in labor costs and customer growth. The sharing
mechanism will remain in place for 20 years, subject to
established modification procedures.

Atmos Energy Mid-States Division.

During the third
quarter of 2005, the Mid-States Division filed a rate case in
its Georgia service area seeking a rate increase of
$4.0 million. We anticipate that the rate case will be
finalized in November 2005.

In February 2004, the Mid-States Division filed a rate case with
the Virginia Corporation Commission (VCC) to request a
$1.0 million increase in our base rates, WNA and recovery
of the gas cost component of bad-debt expense. The VCC granted a
rate increase in November 2004 of $0.4 million that was
retroactively effective to July 27, 2004. Additionally, the
VCC authorized WNA beginning in July 2005 and the ability to
recover the gas cost component of bad debt expense.

In November 2005, we received a notice from the Tennessee
Regulatory Authority that it was opening an investigation into
allegations that we are overcharging customers in parts of
Tennessee by approximately $10.0 million per year. We do
not believe that we are overcharging our customers and we intend
to participate fully in the investigation.

Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division.

In December 2004, the
Mid-Tex Division made a GRIP filing to include in rate base
approximately $32.0 million of distribution capital
expenditures made by TXU Gas during calendar year 2003, which
should result in additional revenues of approximately
$6.7 million. These capital costs will be recovered through
a monthly customer charge that began in October 2005.

In September 2005, the Mid-Tex Division made a GRIP filing to
include in rate base approximately $29.4 million of
distribution capital costs incurred during calendar year 2004.
It is anticipated that $6.7 million in additional annual
revenue will be authorized through this filing. The cities in
this division’s service area and the RRC must rule on this
filing before January 4, 2006. If necessary, the RRC will
rule on an appeal of any cities actions in the first quarter of
calendar year 2006.

On September 1, 2005, the Mid-Tex Division filed its annual
gas cost reconciliation with the RRC. The filing involves
approximately $14.0 million in refunds of amounts
overcollected from customers between July 1, 2004 and
June 30, 2005. The Mid-Tex Division has proposed to the RRC
the accelerating of refunds to December through March rather
than during the usual refund period of October through June to
help offset higher gas costs for residential, commercial and
industrial customers during the 2005 — 2006 heating
season, which proposal is still under consideration.

In August 2005, we received a “show cause” order from
the City of Dallas, which requires us to provide information
that demonstrates good cause for showing that our existing
distribution rates charged to customers in the city of Dallas
should not be reduced. We are currently preparing our response
to this order and anticipate filing it by the November 22,
2005 due date.

In September 2004, the Mid-Tex Division filed its 36-Month Gas
Contract Review with the RRC. This proceeding involves a
prudency review of gas purchases totaling $2.2 billion made
by the Mid-Tex Division from November 1, 2000 through
October 31, 2003. A hearing on this matter was held before
the RRC in late June. No decision is expected from the RRC until
the end of December 2005 or January 2006.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Mid-Tex Division
pursued a filing initiated by TXU Gas seeking authorization of a
surcharge to recover the rate case expenses incurred by the
Mid-Tex Division, Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division and
the intervening cities in connection with their last systemwide
rate case completed in May 2004. The filing also covered the
estimated expenses to prosecute the aforementioned recovery
docket and the severed dockets from the systemwide rate case. On
January 25, 2005, the RRC issued an order authorizing the
recovery of the $10.2 million of expenses over a 3-year
period with interest.

The Mid-Tex Division is also pursuing an appeal to the Travis
County District Court of the Final Order in its last systemwide
rate case completed in May 2004 to obtain a return of and on its
investment associated with the Poly I replacement pipe that was
originally disallowed in its most recent rate case completed in
May 2004. Additionally, the Mid-Tex Division is seeking the
right to surcharge for gas cost underrecoveries. The



case has been assigned to a judge, but the briefing schedule has
been postponed indefinitely to allow the parties to pursue
settlement discussions.

Atmos Energy Mississippi Division.

Through the first
quarter of fiscal 2005, the MPSC required that we file for rate
adjustments every six months. Rate filings were made in May and
November of each year and the rate adjustments typically became
effective in the following July and January.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we agreed with the
MPSC to suspend our May 2005 semi-annual filing to allow
sufficient time for us and the MPSC to undertake a comprehensive
review in an effort to improve our rate design and the
ratemaking process. Effective October 1, 2005, our rate
design was modified to substitute the original agreed-upon
benchmark with a sharing mechanism to allow the sharing of cost
savings above an allowed return on equity level. Further, we
will move from a semi-annual filing process to an annual filing
process. Additionally, our WNA period will begin on
November 1 instead of November 15, and will end on
April 30 instead of May 15. Also, we now have a fixed
monthly customer base charge which makes a portion of our
earnings less susceptible to usage. We will make our first
annual filing under this new structure in September 2006.

In October 2003, the MPSC issued a final order that denied our
May 2003 request for a rate increase of $5.8 million. In
January 2004, the MPSC authorized additional annual revenue of
$5.9 million on our November 2003 filing, which became
effective on December 1, 2003. In September 2004, the MPSC
authorized additional annualized revenue of $4.7 million on
our May 2004 filing, which became effective on June 1,
2004. However, the MPSC originally disallowed certain deferred
costs totaling $2.8 million. In connection with the
modification of our rate design described above, the MPSC
reversed its decision regarding these costs, and we included
these costs into our rates in October 2005.

We filed our second semiannual filing for 2004 on
November 5, 2004, requesting rate adjustments of
$6.0 million in annualized revenue. The MPSC allowed us to
include $3.0 million in annualized revenue in our rates
effective January 1, 2005. In February 2005, we entered
into an agreement with the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff
that provides for an additional $1.3 million in annualized
revenue that was retroactive to January 2005, which was approved
by the MPSC during the second quarter of fiscal 2005.

Atmos Energy West Texas Division.

In September 2005, the
West Texas Division made a GRIP filing to include in rate base
approximately $22.6 million of distribution capital costs
incurred during calendar year 2004 which should result in
additional annual revenues of approximately $3.8 million.
We expect these capital costs will be recovered through a
monthly customer charge beginning in December 2005.

In October 2003, our West Texas Division filed a rate case in
Lubbock requesting a $3.0 million increase in annual
revenues and WNA for our residential, commercial and
public-authority customers. The City of Lubbock approved a
$1.5 million increase effective March 1, 2004, as well
as the proposed WNA.

In September 2003, our West Texas Division filed a rate case in
its West Texas System to request a $7.7 million increase in
annual revenues and WNA for its residential, commercial and
public-authority customers. In May 2004, the 66 cities in
its West Texas System approved an increase of $3.2 million
in our annual utility revenues. The cities also approved a WNA
rider for residential, commercial, public-authority and
state-institution customers. This rider became effective in
October 2004.

In June 2003, the West Texas Division filed a rate case in
Amarillo, Texas, requesting a $5.1 million increase in
annual revenues. In August 2003, the City of Amarillo, Texas
approved an annual increase of approximately $2.8 million,
which was effective for bills rendered on or after
September 1, 2003. The increase was primarily comprised of
an increase in monthly customer charges. The agreement with
Amarillo also provided for changes in the rate structure to
recover the cost of uncollectible accounts, adjustments to base
rates to compensate for declining gas usage per customer and
provided WNA for the period October through May of each year,
which became effective in October 2003.



Other Regulation

Each of our utility divisions is regulated by various state or
local public utility authorities. We are also subject to
regulation by the United States Department of Transportation
with respect to safety requirements in the operation and
maintenance of our gas distribution facilities. Our distribution
operations are also subject to various state and federal laws
regulating environmental matters. From time to time we receive
inquiries regarding various environmental matters. We believe
that our properties and operations substantially comply with and
are operated in substantial conformity with applicable safety
and environmental statutes and regulations. There are no
administrative or judicial proceedings arising under
environmental quality statutes pending or known to be
contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a
material adverse effect on us or our operations. Our
environmental claims have arisen primarily from manufactured gas
plant sites in Tennessee, Iowa and Missouri and mercury
contamination sites in Kansas. These claims are more fully
described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial
statements.

Our Mid-Tex and Atmos Pipeline — Texas operations are
wholly intrastate in character and are subject to regulation by
municipalities in Texas and the Railroad Commission of Texas.
These acquired operations do not include any certificated
interstate transmission facilities subject to the jurisdiction
of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under
the Natural Gas Act, any sales for resale under the rate
jurisdiction of the FERC or any transportation service that is
subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act. Since
1988, the FERC has allowed, pursuant to Section 311 of the
Natural Gas Policy Act, gas transportation services through the
intrastate transmission facilities we acquired “on behalf
of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies
served by interstate pipelines, without subjecting the acquired
operations to the jurisdiction of the FERC. We did not acquire
any manufactured gas plant sites in the TXU Gas acquisition. Our
acquisition agreement with TXU Gas addresses other environmental
matters, which we expect to have no material adverse effect on
us or our operations.

Competition

Although our utility operations are not currently in significant
direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to
residential and commercial customers within our service areas,
we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of
alternative fuels for sales to industrial and agricultural
customers. We compete in all aspects of our business with
alternative energy sources, including, in particular,
electricity. Electric utilities offer electricity as a rival
energy source and compete for the space heating, water heating
and cooking markets. Promotional incentives, improved equipment
efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the
acceptability of electrical equipment. The principal means to
compete against alternative fuels is lower prices, and natural
gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the
residential, commercial and industrial markets. However, higher
gas prices, coupled with the electric utilities’ marketing
efforts, have increased competition for residential and
commercial customers. In addition, our Natural Gas Marketing
segment competes with other natural gas brokers in obtaining
natural gas supplies for our customers.

Employees

At September 30, 2005, we had 4,543 employees, consisting
of 4,327 employees in our utility segment and 216 employees in
our other segments. See “Operating Statistics —
Utility Sales and Statistical Data by Division” for the
number of employees by division.

ITEM 2.

Properties

Distribution, transmission and related assets

At September 30, 2005 our utility segment owned an
aggregate of 81,604 miles of underground distribution and
transmission mains throughout our gas distribution systems.
These mains are located on easements or rights-of-way which
generally provide for perpetual use. We maintain our mains
through a program of continuous inspection and repair and
believe that our system of mains is in good condition. At
September 30, 2005, our pipeline and storage segment owned
6,369 miles of gas transmission and gathering lines.

Our utility segment also holds franchises granted by the
incorporated cities and towns that we serve. At
September 30, 2005, we held 1,098 franchises having terms
generally ranging from five to 35 years. A significant
number of our franchises expire each year, which require renewal
prior to the end of their terms. We believe that we will be able
to renew our franchises as they expire.



Storage Assets

Our utility and pipeline and storage segments own underground
gas storage facilities in several states to supplement the
supply of natural gas in periods of peak demand. The following
table summarizes key information regarding our underground gas
storage facilities:

(1)

Cushion gas represents the volume of gas that must be retained
    in a facility to maintain reservoir pressure.

(2)

Acquired on October 1, 2004 in connection with the TXU Gas
    acquisition.

(3)

We own 25 percent of this facility and Acadian Gas Pipeline
    System owns the remaining 75 percent of this facility.
    Acadian Gas Pipeline System operates this facility.



Additionally, we contract for storage service in underground
storage facilities on many of the interstate pipelines serving
us to supplement our proprietary storage capacity. The following
table summarizes our contracted storage capacity:

See footnotes on the following page.



(1)

Maximum daily withdrawal quantity (MDWQ) amounts will
    fluctuate depending upon the season and the month. Unless
    otherwise noted, MDWQ amounts represent the MDWQ amounts as of
    November 1, which is the beginning of the winter heating
    season.

(2)

We contract for storage service in two underground storage
    facilities, Wiseman and Ellis, from this company.

Other facilities

Our utility segment owns and operates one propane peak shaving
plant with a total capacity of approximately 180,000 gallons
that can produce an equivalent of approximately 3,300 Mcf
daily.

Offices

Our administrative offices are consolidated in a leased facility
in Dallas, Texas. We also maintain field offices throughout our
distribution system, the majority of which are located in leased
facilities. Our nonutility operations are headquartered in
Houston, Texas, with offices in Houston and other locations,
primarily in leased facilities.

volatility and counterparty creditworthiness; national, regional
and local economic conditions; the Company’s ability to
continue to access the capital markets; the effects of inflation
and changes in the availability and prices of natural gas,
including the volatility of natural gas prices; increased
competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of
energy; risks relating to the acquisition of the TXU Gas
operations, including without limitation, the Company’s
increased indebtedness resulting from the acquisition of the TXU
Gas operations; the impact of recent natural disasters on our
operations, especially Hurricane Katrina, and other
uncertainties discussed herein, all of which are difficult to
predict and many of which are beyond the control of the Company.
Accordingly, while the Company believes these forward-looking
statements to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they
will approximate actual experience or that the expectations
derived from them will be realized. Further, the Company
undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of its
forward-looking statements whether as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE

Our performance in the future will primarily depend on the
results of our utility and nonutility operations. Several
factors exist that could influence our future financial
performance, some of which are described below. They should be
considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking
statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on
behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and
conditions to differ materially from those set out in these
forward-looking statements.

Our operations are weather sensitive.

Weather is one of the most significant factors influencing our
performance. Our natural gas utility sales volumes and related
revenues are correlated with heating requirements that result
from cold winter weather. Our agricultural sales volumes are
associated with the rainfall levels during the growing season in
our



West Texas and Kansas irrigation markets. Although weather
normalized rates in effect in several of our jurisdictions
should mitigate the adverse effects of warmer than normal
weather on our utility operating results, approximately fifteen
to twenty percent of our utility gross profit margin is
sensitive to weather, particularly our Louisiana and Mid-Tex
divisions. This means we will not be able to increase
customers’ bills to offset lower gas usage when the weather
is warmer than normal.

Our Mid-Tex Division operations benefit from a rate structure
that combines a monthly customer charge with a declining block
rate schedule to partially mitigate the impact of warmer than
normal weather on revenue. The combination of the monthly
customer charge and the customer billing under the first block
of the declining block rate schedule provides for the recovery
of most of our fixed costs for such operations under most
weather conditions. However, this rate structure is not as
beneficial during periods where weather is significantly warmer
than normal.

Finally, sustained cold weather could adversely affect our
natural gas marketing operations as we may be required to
purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain
sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts.

We are subject to regulation which can directly impact our
    operations.

Our natural gas utility business is subject to various regulated
returns on its rate base in each of the 12 states in which
we operate. We monitor the allowed rates of return, our
effectiveness in earning such rates and initiate rate
proceedings or operating changes as needed. In addition, in the
normal course of the regulatory environment, assets are placed
in service and historical test periods are established before
rate cases can be filed. Once rate cases are filed, regulatory
bodies have the authority to suspend implementation of the new
rates while studying the cases. Because of this process, we must
temporarily suffer the negative financial effects of having
placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief,
which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag”. In
addition, once our rates have been approved, they are still
subject to challenge for their reasonableness by appropriate
regulatory authorities. Also, our debt and equity financings are
also subject to approval by regulatory bodies in certain states,
which could limit our ability to take advantage of favorable
short-term market conditions.

Our business could also be affected by deregulation initiatives,
including the development of unbundling initiatives in the
natural gas industry. Unbundling is the separation of the
provision and pricing of local distribution gas services into
discrete components. It typically focuses on the separation of
the distribution and gas supply components and the resulting
opening of the regulated components of sales services to
alternative unregulated suppliers of those services. Because of
our enhanced technology and distribution system infrastructures,
we believe that we are now positively positioned should
unbundling evolve. Consequently, we expect there would be no
significant adverse effect on our business should unbundling or
further deregulation of the natural gas distribution service
business occur.

Finally, contractual limitations could adversely affect our
ability to withdraw gas from storage, which could cause us to
purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to obtain
sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts. We seek to
minimize this risk by increasing our storage capacity and
enhancing the flexibility of our natural gas marketing contracts.

Our operations are exposed to market risks that are beyond
    our control, which could result in financial losses.

Our risk management operations in our natural gas marketing
segment are subject to market risks beyond our control including
market liquidity, commodity price volatility and counterparty
creditworthiness. Market liquidity is affected by the number of
trading partners in the market.

Although we maintain a risk management policy, we may not be
able to completely offset the price risk associated with
volatile gas prices or the risk in our gas trading activities
which could lead to financial losses. Physical trading also
introduces price risk on any net open positions at the end of
each trading day, as well as a risk of loss resulting from
intra-day fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily
price movements



between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for future
delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is hedged.
Although we manage our business to maintain no open positions,
at times, limited net open positions related to our physical
storage may occur on a short-term basis. The determination of
our net open position as of any day requires us to make
assumptions as to future circumstances, including the use of gas
by our customers in relation to our anticipated storage and
market positions. Because the price risk associated with any net
open position at the end of each day may increase if the
assumptions are not realized, we review these assumptions as
part of our daily monitoring activities. Net open positions may
result in an adverse impact on our financial condition or
results of operations if market prices move in an unfavorable
manner.

Our utility segment uses a combination of storage and financial
hedges to partially insulate us against volatility in gas prices
and to help moderate the effects of higher customer accounts
receivable caused by higher gas prices. Our natural gas
marketing segment manages margins and limits risk exposure on
the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixed-price
purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural
gas through the use of a variety of financial derivatives.

We could realize financial losses on these activities as a
result of volatility in the market value of the underlying
commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a
contract.

Further, the use of financial instruments to conduct our hedging
and market risk activities subjects us to counterparty risk.
Adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties
could limit the level of trading activities with these parties
and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a
contract. We believe this risk is mitigated due to the large
number of counterparties used in our risk management activities.

Our net periodic pension and other postretirement costs are
subject to market risk as the fluctuation in the fair value of
the assets used to fund our various benefit plans could lead to
significant fluctuations in these costs.

Finally, we are subject to interest rate risk on our commercial
paper borrowings and floating rate debt. We could experience
higher interest expense if interest rates increase or increased
volatility if short-term interest rates become volatile.

National, regional and local economic conditions have a
    direct impact on our operations.

Our operations are affected by the conditions and overall
strength of the national, regional and local economies,
including interest rates, changes in the capital markets and
increases in the costs of our primary commodity, natural gas.
These factors impact the amount of residential, industrial and
commercial growth in our service territories. Additionally,
these factors could adversely impact our customer collections.

Further, AEM’s operations are concentrated in the natural
gas industry, and its customers and suppliers may be subject to
economic risks affecting that industry.

The execution of our business plan could be affected by an
    inability to access financial markets.

We rely upon access to both short-term and long-term capital
markets as a source of liquidity to satisfy our liquidity
requirements. Although we believe we will maintain sufficient
access to these financial markets, adverse changes in the
economy, the overall health of the industries in which we
operate and changes to our credit ratings could limit access to
these markets and restrict the execution of our business plan.

Our long-term debt is currently rated as “investment
grade” by Standard & Poor’s Corporation
(S&P), Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) and
Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch), the three credit rating agencies
that rate our long-term debt securities. There can be no
assurance that these rating agencies will maintain investment
grade ratings for our long-term debt. If we were to lose our
investment-grade rating, the commercial paper markets and the
commodity derivatives markets could become unavailable to us.
This would increase our borrowing costs for working capital and
reduce the borrowing capacity of our gas marketing affiliate. In
addition, if our commercial paper ratings were lowered, it would
increase the cost of commercial paper financing and could reduce
or eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper markets.
If we are



unable to issue commercial paper, we intend to borrow under our
bank credit facilities to meet our working capital needs. This
would increase the cost of our working capital financing.

Inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact
    our customer base and customer collections and increase our
    level of indebtedness.

Inflation has caused increases in certain operating expenses and
has required assets to be replaced at higher costs. We have a
process in place to continually review the adequacy of our
utility gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of
providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting
those gas rates. Historically, we have been able to budget and
control operating expenses and investments within the amounts
authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do
so. The ability to control expenses is an important factor that
will influence future results.

Rapid increases in the price of purchased gas, which has
occurred recently and in some prior years, causes us to
experience a significant increase in short-term debt because we
must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased, which can be
significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered
through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas
delivered. Increases in purchased gas costs also slow our
utility collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay
the payment of their gas bills, leading to higher than normal
accounts receivable. This situation could result in higher
short-term debt levels and increased bad debt expense. Due to
the significant increase in natural gas prices resulting
primarily from the impact of recent natural disasters, we are
anticipating increases in our short-term debt, accounts
receivable and bad debt expense during fiscal 2006.

Finally, higher costs of natural gas in recent years have
already caused many of our utility customers to conserve in the
use of our gas services and could lead to even more customers
utilizing such conservation methods.

Our operations are subject to increased
    competition.

We are facing increased competition from other energy suppliers
as well as electric companies and from energy marketing and
trading companies. In the case of industrial customers, such as
manufacturing plants, and agricultural customers, adverse
economic conditions, including higher gas costs, could cause
these customers to use alternative sources of energy, such as
electricity, or bypass our systems in favor of special
competitive contracts with lower per-unit costs. Our pipeline
and storage operations currently face limited competition from
other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to
provide or arrange transportation, storage and other services
for customers. However, competition may increase if new
intrastate pipelines are constructed near our existing
facilities.

We have only limited recourse under the acquisition
    agreement for losses relating to the TXU Gas acquisition.

The diligence conducted in connection with the TXU Gas
acquisition and the indemnification provided in the acquisition
agreement may not be sufficient to protect us from, or
compensate us for, all losses resulting from the acquisition or
TXU Gas’s prior operations. For example, under the terms of
the acquisition agreement, the first $15 million of many
indemnifiable losses are to be borne by us, and the agreement
provides for sharing of losses with respect to unknown
environmental matters that may affect the assets we acquired
after we have borne $10 million in costs relating to such
matters. In addition, under the terms of the acquisition
agreement, the maximum aggregate amount of such losses for which
TXU Gas will indemnify us is approximately $192.5 million.
A material loss associated with the TXU Gas acquisition for
which there is not adequate indemnification could negatively
affect our results of operations, our financial condition and
our reputation in the industry, thereby reducing the anticipated
benefits of the acquisition.

Recent natural disasters, especially Hurricane Katrina,
    have adversely impacted our operations.

On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf
Coast, inflicting significant damage in our eastern Louisiana
operations. The hardest hit areas in our service area were in
Jefferson, St. Tammany,



St. Bernard and Plaquemines parishes. In total,
approximately 230,000 of our natural gas customers were affected
in these areas. A significant number of these customers will not
require gas service for some time because of sustained damages.
We cannot predict with certainty how many of these customers
will return to these service areas and over what time period.
Additionally, we cannot accurately determine what regulatory
actions, if any, may be taken by the regulators with respect to
these areas. Finally, although we believe our insurance will
cover all losses in excess of our deductibles, it is possible
that certain of these losses may not be fully recoverable.

OVERVIEW

In fiscal 2005, we earned $135.8 million in net income or
$1.72 per diluted share, compared with net income of
$86.2 million, or $1.58 per diluted share in fiscal
2004. The 58 percent year-over-year increase in net income
was primarily attributable to the incremental results we
achieved from our Mid-Tex and Atmos Pipeline — Texas
divisions that we acquired on October 1, 2004. Strong
earnings in our natural gas marketing segment primarily
attributable to favorable results from the management of our
storage portfolio also contributed to the increase in net
income. These positive factors helped overcome the adverse
effects on our utility segment of weather (adjusted for WNA)
that was 11 percent warmer than normal, which reduced our
net income by $22.8 million, or $0.29 per diluted
share, and the impact of Hurricane Katrina, which reduced our
net income by $3.8 million, or $0.05 per diluted share.

Fiscal 2005 was highlighted by our acquisition of the natural
gas distribution and pipeline operations of TXU Gas Company. The
TXU Gas operations we acquired are regulated businesses engaged
in the purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of natural
gas in the north-central, eastern and western parts of Texas.
Through these newly acquired operations, we provide gas
distribution services to approximately 1.5 million
residential and business customers in Texas, including the
Dallas/ Fort Worth metropolitan area. We also now own and
operate a system consisting of 6,162 miles of gas
transmission and gathering lines and five underground storage
reservoirs in Texas.

The purchase price of the TXU Gas acquisition was approximately
$1.9 billion, before transaction costs and expenses, which
we paid in cash. We funded the purchase price for the TXU Gas
acquisition with approximately $235.7 million in net
proceeds from our offering of approximately 9.9 million
shares of common stock, which we completed on July 19,
2004, and approximately $1.7 billion in net proceeds from
our issuance on October 1, 2004 of commercial paper
backstopped by a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement,
which we entered into on September 24, 2004 for bridge
financing for the TXU Gas acquisition. In October 2004, we
repaid the outstanding commercial paper used to fund the
acquisition through the issuance of senior unsecured notes on
October 22, 2004, which generated net proceeds of
approximately $1.4 billion and the sale of
16.1 million shares of common stock on October 27,
2004, which generated net proceeds of approximately
$381.6 million.

As a result of the acquisition, effective October 1, 2004,
we created the pipeline and storage segment which includes the
regulated pipeline and storage operations of the Atmos
Pipeline–Texas Division and the nonregulated pipeline and
storage operations of Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC, which was
previously included in our other nonutility segment.



The TXU Gas acquisition essentially doubled the size of the
Company as measured by assets, revenues and customers. The
following table presents selected financial information for the
Mid-Tex Division and Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division
operations for the year ended September 30, 2005:

The impact of the TXU Gas acquisition, combined with continued
strong performance in our natural gas marketing segment
contributed to the following financial results during the year
ended September 30, 2005:



•

Operating cash flow provided $386.9 million compared with
    $270.7 million, reflecting increased net income and more
    effective net working capital management partially offset by
    lower than expected utility sales volumes due to the effect of
    warmer weather.

•

Capital expenditures increased to $333.2 million from
    $190.3 million primarily reflecting spending for the
    Mid-Tex Division ($115.0 million) and the Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division ($31.4 million).

Our financial performance is discussed in greater detail below
in Results of Operations.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. Preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
and the related disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities. We based our estimates on historical experience and
various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our
estimates, including those related to risk management and
trading activities, allowance for doubtful accounts, legal and
environmental accruals, insurance accruals, pension and
postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes and the
valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and
other long-lived assets. Our critical accounting policies are
reviewed by the Audit Committee quarterly. Actual results may
differ from estimates.

Regulation

— Our utility operations are subject
to regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of
accounting records and various other matters by the respective
regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. Our
regulated utility operations are accounted for in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 71,

Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation.

This statement requires cost-based,
rate-regulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect
the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices
and policies of the various regulatory commissions in their
financial statements. We record regulatory assets for costs that
have been deferred for which future recovery through customer
rates is considered probable. Regulatory liabilities are
recorded when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for
amounts that will be credited to customers through the
ratemaking process. As a result, certain costs that would
normally be expensed under accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States are permitted to be capitalized
because they can be recovered through rates. Further, regulation
may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are
recognized. The amounts to be recovered or recognized are based
upon historical experience and our understanding of the
regulations. The impact of regulation on our utility operations
may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or
the issuance of new regulations.

Revenue recognition

— Sales of natural gas to
our utility customers are billed on a monthly cycle basis;
however, the billing cycle periods for certain classes of
customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods
used for financial reporting purposes. We follow the revenue
accrual method of accounting for utility segment revenues
whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers, but
not yet billed under the cycle billing method, are estimated and
accrued and the related costs are charged to expense.

Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for
increases and decreases in our purchased gas cost through
purchased gas adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas adjustment
mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering
purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate
case to address all of the utility’s non-gas costs. These
mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities
recognize a particular type of expense, such as purchased gas
costs, that (i) is subject to significant price
fluctuations compared to the utility’s other costs,
(ii) represents a large component of the utility’s
cost of service and (iii) is generally outside the control
of the gas utility. There is no gross profit generated through
purchased gas adjustments, but they do provide a
dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or decreases in utility
gas costs. Although substantially all of our utility sales to
our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase,
utility gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations
in the cost of gas due to the purchased gas adjustment
mechanism. The effects of these purchased gas adjustment
mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance
sheet.



Energy trading contracts resulting in the delivery of a
commodity where we are the principal in the transaction are
recorded as natural gas marketing sales or purchases at the time
of physical delivery. Realized gains and losses from the
settlement of financial instruments that do not result in
physical delivery related to our natural gas marketing energy
trading contracts and unrealized gains and losses from changes
in the market value of open contracts are included as a
component of natural gas marketing revenues.

Allowance for doubtful accounts

— For the
majority of our receivables, we establish an allowance for
doubtful accounts based on our collections experience. On
certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific
customer’s inability or reluctance to pay, we record an
allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce
the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to
collect. However, if circumstances change, our estimate of the
recoverability of accounts receivable could be different.
Circumstances which could affect our estimates include, but are
not limited to, customer credit issues, the level of natural gas
prices and general economic conditions.

Derivatives and hedging activities

— In our
utility segment, we use a combination of storage and financial
derivatives to partially insulate us and our natural gas utility
customers against gas price volatility during the winter heating
season. The financial derivatives we use in our utility segment
are accounted for under the mark-to-market method pursuant to
SFAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.

Changes in the valuation of these
derivatives primarily result from changes in the valuation of
the portfolio of contracts, maturity and settlement of contracts
and newly originated transactions. However, because the costs of
financial derivatives used in our utility segment will
ultimately be recovered through our rates, current period
changes in the assets and liabilities from these risk management
activities are recorded as a component of deferred gas costs in
accordance with SFAS 71. Accordingly, there is no earnings
impact to our utility segment as a result of the use of
financial derivatives. The changes in the assets and liabilities
from risk management activities are recognized in purchased gas
cost in the income statement when the related costs are
recovered through our rates.

Our natural gas marketing risk management activities are
conducted through AEM. AEM is exposed to risks associated with
changes in the market price of natural gas, which we manage
through a combination of storage and financial derivatives,
including futures, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options
and swap contracts with counterparties. Option contracts provide
the right, but not the requirement, to buy or sell the commodity
at a fixed price. Swap contracts require receipt of payment for
the commodity based on the difference between a fixed price and
the market price on the settlement date. The use of these
contracts is subject to our risk management policies, which are
monitored for compliance daily.

We participate in transactions in which we combine the natural
gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs
incurred to serve our customers. Additionally, we engage in
natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and
profit from pricing differences that occur over time. We
purchase or sell physical natural gas and then sell or purchase
financial contracts at a price sufficient to cover our carrying
costs and provide a gross profit margin. Through the use of
transportation and storage services and derivatives, we are able
to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing
differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing
differences that occur over time.

Under SFAS 133, natural gas inventory is the hedged item in
a fair-value hedge and is marked to market monthly using the
inside FERC (iFERC) price at the end of each month. Changes in
fair value are recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the
period of change. Costs to store the gas are recognized in the
period the costs are incurred. We recognize revenue and the
carrying value of the inventory as an associated purchased gas
cost in our consolidated statement of income when we sell the
gas and deliver it out of the storage facility.

Derivatives associated with our natural gas inventory are marked
to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with changes in
fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the
period of change. The difference in the indices used to mark to
market our physical inventory (iFERC) and the related fair-value
hedge (NYMEX) is reported as a component of revenue and can
result in volatility in our reported net income. Over time,
gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be
offset by gains and losses on the fair-value hedges, resulting
in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we
anticipated at the



time we structured the original transaction. In addition, we
continually manage our positions to optimize value as market
conditions and other circumstances change.

Similar to our inventory position, we attempt to mitigate
substantially all of the commodity price risk associated with
our fixed-price contracts with minimum volume requirements
through the use of various offsetting derivatives. Prior to
April 1, 2004, these derivatives were not designated as
hedges under SFAS 133 because they naturally locked in the
economic gross profit margin at the time we entered into the
contract. The fixed-price forward and offsetting derivative
contracts were marked to market each month with changes in fair
value recognized as unrealized gains and losses recorded in
revenue in our consolidated statement of income. The unrealized
gains and losses were realized as a component of revenue in the
period in which we fulfilled the requirements of the fixed-price
contract and the derivatives settled. To the extent that the
unrealized gains and losses of the fixed-price forward contracts
and the offsetting derivatives did not offset exactly, our
earnings experienced some volatility. At delivery, the gains and
losses on the fixed-price contracts were offset by gains and
losses on the derivatives, resulting in the realization of the
economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we
structured the original transaction. In addition, we continually
managed our positions to optimize value as market conditions and
other circumstances changed.

Effective April 1, 2004, we elected to treat our
fixed-price forward contracts as normal purchases and sales. As
a result, we ceased marking the fixed-price forward contracts to
market. We designated the offsetting derivative contracts as
cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions. As a result of
this change, unrealized gains and losses on these open
derivative contracts are now recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in
earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are
sold. Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred, is reported
as a component of revenue.

During fiscal 2004, we entered into four Treasury lock
agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest
cost of financing associated with the anticipated issuance of
$875 million of long-term debt. We designated these
Treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges of an anticipated
transaction. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses associated
with the Treasury lock agreements were recorded as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income. These Treasury lock
agreements were settled in October 2004 with a net
$43.8 million payment to the counterparties. This realized
loss will be recognized as a component of interest expense over
the life of the related financing arrangements.

The fair value of our financial derivatives is determined
through a combination of prices actively quoted on national
exchanges, prices provided by other external sources and prices
based on models and other valuation methods. Changes in the
valuation of our financial derivatives primarily result from
changes in market prices, the valuation of the portfolio of our
contracts, maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly
originated transactions, each of which directly affect the
estimated fair value of our derivatives. We believe the market
prices and models used to value these derivatives represent the
best information available with respect to closing exchange and
over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility factors
underlying the contracts. Values are adjusted to reflect the
potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over
a reasonable period of time under present market conditions.

Impairment assessments

— We perform impairment
assessments of our goodwill, intangible assets subject to
amortization and long-lived assets. We currently have no
indefinite-lived intangible assets. We annually evaluate our
goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal
quarter or as impairment indicators arise. We use a present
value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the
fair value of our reporting units. We have determined our
reporting units to be each of our utility divisions and
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Goodwill is allocated to the
reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise
to the goodwill.

The discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill
impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including
the timing of future cash flows, future growth rates and the
discount rate. An impairment charge is recognized if the
carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its
fair value.

We periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have
occurred that indicate that our intangible assets subject to
amortization and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable
or that the remaining useful



life may warrant revision. When such events or circumstances are
present, we assess the recoverability of these assets by
determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through
expected future cash flows. These cash flow projections consider
various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and
the discount rate and are based upon the best information
available at the time the estimate is made. Changes in these
factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and
result in the recognition of an impairment charge. An impairment
charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying
amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash
flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset.

Pension and other postretirement plans

—
Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are
determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous
assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan
assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed
discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality
data. We review the estimates and assumptions underlying our
pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities
annually based upon a June 30 measurement date. The assumed
discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that
generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs
and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health
care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally
have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan
costs and liabilities.

The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the
actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement
obligation and net pension and postretirement cost. When
establishing our discount rate, we consider absolute high
quality corporate bond rates based on Moody’s Aa bond
index, changes in those rates from the prior year and the
implied discount rate that is derived from matching our
projected benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate
bond spot rate curve.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in
calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our
annual pension and postretirement plan cost. We estimate the
expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond
returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of
active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset
rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the
guidance from our investment advisors in making a final
determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the
extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the
course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate,
that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan cost is
not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases
future pension or postretirement plan cost over a period of
approximately ten to twelve years.

We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in
determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual
health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted
legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of
retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our
participant census information as of the measurement date.

Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and
differences between the actual return on plan assets and the
expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on
the amount of pension cost ultimately recognized. A
0.25 percent change in our discount rate will impact our
pension and postretirement cost approximately $1.6 million.
A 0.25 percent change in our expected rate of return will
impact our pension and postretirement cost by approximately
$0.8 million.

Utility segment

Our utility segment has historically contributed 70 to
85 percent of our consolidated net income. The primary
factors that impact the results of our utility operations are
seasonal weather patterns, competitive factors in the energy
industry and economic conditions in our service areas. Natural
gas sales to residential, commercial and public-authority
customers are affected by winter heating season requirements.
This generally results in higher operating revenues and net
income during the period from October through March of each year
and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net
losses during the period from April through September of each
year. Accordingly, our second fiscal quarter has historically
been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of
approximately 67 percent of our consolidated net income
having been earned in the second quarter during the three most
recently completed fiscal years. Additionally, we typically
experience higher levels of accounts receivable, accounts
payable, gas stored underground and short-term debt balances
during the winter heating season due to the seasonal nature of
our revenues and the need to purchase and store gas to support
these operations. Utility sales to industrial customers are much
less weather sensitive. Utility sales to agricultural customers,
which typically use natural gas to power irrigation pumps during
the period from March through September, are primarily affected
by rainfall amounts and the price of natural gas.

Changes in the cost of gas impact revenue but do not directly
affect our gross profit from utility operations because the
fluctuations in gas prices are passed through to our customers.
Accordingly, we believe gross profit margin is a better
indicator of our financial performance than revenues. However,
higher gas costs may cause customers to conserve, or, in the
case of industrial customers, to use alternative energy sources.
Higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts
receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense and
may require us to increase borrowings under our credit
facilities resulting in higher interest expense.



The effects of weather that is above or below normal are
partially offset through weather normalization adjustments in
certain of our service areas. WNA allows us to increase the base
rate portion of customers’ bills when weather is warmer
than normal and decrease the base rate when weather is colder
than normal.

Our Mid-Tex Division does not have WNA. However, its operations
benefit from a rate structure that combines a monthly customer
charge with a declining block rate schedule to partially
mitigate the impact of warmer-than-normal weather on revenue.
The combination of the monthly customer charge and the customer
billing under the first block of the declining block rate
schedule provides for the recovery of a significant portion of
our fixed costs for such operations under average weather
conditions. However, this rate structure is not as beneficial
during periods where weather is significantly warmer than normal.

Operating income

Utility gross profit increased to $907.4 million for the
year ended September 30, 2005 from $503.1 million for
the year ended September 30, 2004. Total throughput for our
utility business was 411.1 Bcf during the current year
compared to 246.0 Bcf in the prior year.

The increase in utility gross profit margin primarily reflects
the impact of the acquisition of the Mid-Tex Division resulting
in an increase in utility gross profit margin and total
throughput of $398.2 million and 174.3 Bcf. The
$6.1 million increase in the gross profit generated from
our other utility operations primarily reflects rate increases
in our Mississippi and West Texas divisions that were absent in
the prior year coupled with the recognition of a
$1.9 million refund to our customers in our Colorado
service area in the prior year. Offsetting these increases was a
$3.9 million reduction in gross profit in our Louisiana
Division due to the impact of Hurricane Katrina. Gross profit
margins, particularly in Louisiana, were also adversely impacted
by weather (as adjusted for jurisdictions with
weather-normalized operations) that was five percent warmer than
normal and one percent warmer than the prior year period.
Additionally, gross profit margin was adversely impacted by the
lack of cold weather in patterns sufficient to encourage
customers to increase their heat load consumption and lower
irrigation throughput in our West Texas and Colorado-Kansas
Divisions.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes,
increased to $671.0 million for the year ended
September 30, 2005 from $343.2 million for the year
ended September 30, 2004 primarily as a result of the
addition of the Mid-Tex Division. Excluding the impact of the
Mid-Tex Division, operating expenses for our other utility
operations increased $14.5 million primarily due to
$2.3 million associated with the effects of Hurricane
Katrina, a $7.7 million increase in taxes, other than
income, a $2.4 million increase in operation and
maintenance expense, including the provision for doubtful
accounts, and a $2.1 million increase in depreciation and
amortization. Included in taxes other than income taxes are
franchise and state gross receipts taxes which are paid by our
customers as a component of their monthly bills. Although these
amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings, timing
differences between when the expense is incurred and is
recovered may impact our net income on a temporary basis.
However, there is no permanent effect on net income.

As a result of the aforementioned factors, our utility segment
operating income for the year ended September 30, 2005
increased to $236.4 million from $159.9 million for
the year ended September 30, 2004.

Miscellaneous income

Miscellaneous income increased to $6.8 million for the year
ended September 30, 2005 from $5.8 million for the
year ended September 30, 2004. The increase was
attributable to an increase in interest income earned on higher
cash balances during the current year compared with the prior
year partially offset by the recognition of a $0.8 million
gain on the sale of a building during the year ended
September 30, 2004.

Interest charges

Interest charges allocated to the utility segment for the year
ended September 30, 2005 increased to $112.4 million
from $65.4 million for the year ended September 30,
2004. The increase was attributable to the



interest expense associated with the issuance of long-term debt
to finance the acquisition of the Mid-Tex Division in October
2004. On June 30, 2005, we repaid $72.5 million in
principal on five series of our First Mortgage Bonds prior to
their scheduled maturities. The early repayment of these bonds
resulted in savings of $1.3 million in interest expense in
fiscal 2005.

Natural gas marketing segment

Our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas
supply, arranges transportation and/or storage logistics and
ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices.
To facilitate this process, we utilize proprietary and
customer-owned transportation and storage assets to provide the
various services our customers request, including furnishing
natural gas supplies at fixed and market-based prices, contract
negotiation and administration, load forecasting, gas storage
acquisition and management services, transportation services,
peaking sales and balancing services, capacity utilization
strategies and gas price hedging through the use of derivative
products. As a result, our revenues arise from the types of
commercial transactions we have structured with our customers
and include the value we extract by optimizing the storage and
transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues
for services we deliver.

To optimize the storage and transportation capacity we own or
control, we participate in transactions in which we combine the
natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our
costs incurred to serve our customers by identifying the lowest
cost alternative within the natural gas supplies, transportation
and markets to which we have access. Additionally, we engage in
natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and
profit from the pricing differences that occur over time. We
purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial contracts
at favorable prices to lock in gross profit margins. Through the
use of transportation and storage services and derivative
contracts, we are able to capture gross profit margin through
the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by
recognizing pricing differences that occur over time.

Operating income

Gross profit margin for our natural gas marketing segment
consists primarily of marketing activities, which represent the
utilization of proprietary and customer-owned transportation and
storage assets to provide the various services our customers
request, and storage activities, which are derived from the
optimization of our managed proprietary and third party storage
and transportation assets.

Our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit margin was
comprised of the following for the year ended September 30,
2005 and 2004:

Our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit margin was
$62.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2005
compared to gross profit of $46.6 million for the year
ended September 30, 2004. Gross



profit margin from our natural gas marketing segment for the
year ended September 30, 2005 included an unrealized loss
of $26.0 million compared with an unrealized loss of
$2.8 million in the prior year. Natural gas marketing sales
volumes were 273.2 Bcf during the year ended
September 30, 2005 compared with 265.1 Bcf for the
prior year. Excluding intersegment sales volumes, natural gas
marketing sales volumes were 238.1 Bcf during the current
year compared with 222.6 Bcf in the prior year. The
increase in consolidated natural gas marketing sales volumes
primarily was attributable to successfully executed marketing
strategies into new market areas.

The contribution to gross profit from our storage activities was
a gain of $14.0 million for the year ended
September 30, 2005 compared to a loss of $1.5 million
for the year ended September 30, 2004. The
$15.5 million improvement primarily was attributable to a
$29.9 million increase in the realized storage contribution
for the year ended September 30, 2005 compared to the prior
year due to more favorable arbitrage spread opportunities during
the current year, partially offset by increased storage fees
associated with 9.0 Bcf of newly contracted storage
capacity during the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Annual demand
charges for this new storage approximate $7.6 million. We
may further increase the amount of our storage capacity in the
future; therefore, the impact of price volatility on our
unrealized storage contribution could become more significant in
future periods.

A $14.4 million decrease in the unrealized storage
contribution resulted from an unfavorable movement during the
year ended September 30, 2005 in the forward indices used
to value the storage financial instruments combined with greater
physical natural gas storage quantities at September 30,
2005 compared to the prior year also.

Our marketing activities contributed $48.0 million to our
gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2005 compared
to $48.2 million for the year ended September 30,
2004. The decrease in the marketing contribution primarily was
attributable to $12.0 million of unrealized
marked-to-market losses associated with basis swaps that were
put in place to capture margins in certain volatile market
areas. The increase in unrealized marked-to-market losses was
partially offset by an increase in our realized marketing
margins due to focusing our marketing efforts on higher margin
customers and successfully entering into new market areas.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes,
increased to $21.0 million for the year ended
September 30, 2005 from $18.9 million for the year
ended September 30, 2004. The increase in operating expense
was attributable primarily to an increase in labor costs due to
increased headcount and an increase in regulatory compliance
costs.

The increase in gross profit margin, combined with higher
operating expenses, resulted in an increase in our natural gas
marketing segment operating income to $41.0 million for the
year ended September 30, 2005 compared with operating
income of $27.7 million for the year ended
September 30, 2004.

Pipeline and storage segment

Our pipeline and storage segment consists of the regulated
pipeline and storage operations of the Atmos Pipeline–Texas
Division and the nonregulated pipeline and storage operations of
Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC, which were previously included
in our other nonutility segment. The Atmos Pipeline–Texas
Division transports natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division and for
third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in
Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary in the
pipeline industry including parking arrangements, blending and
sales of inventory on hand. These operations represent one of
the largest intrastate pipeline operations in Texas with a heavy
concentration in the established natural gas-producing areas of
central, northern and eastern Texas, extending into or near the
major producing areas of the Texas Gulf Coast and the Delaware
and Val Verde Basins of West Texas. Nine basins located in Texas
are estimated to contain a substantial portion of the
nation’s remaining onshore natural gas reserves. This
pipeline system provides access to all of these basins.



APS owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in
Kentucky and Louisiana. We also use these storage facilities to
reduce the need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to
meet customer demand during peak periods.

Similar to our utility segment, our pipeline and storage segment
is impacted by seasonal weather patterns, competitive factors in
the energy industry and economic conditions in our service
areas. Natural gas transportation requirements are affected by
the winter heating season requirements of our customers. This
generally results in higher operating revenues and net income
during the period from October through March of each year and
lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net
losses during the period from April through September of each
year. Further, as the Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division
operations provide all of the natural gas for our Mid-Tex
Division, the results of this segment are highly dependent upon
the natural gas requirements of this division.

As a regulated pipeline, the operations of the Atmos
Pipeline — Texas Division may be impacted by the
timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these
costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs.

Operating income

Pipeline and storage gross profit increased to
$157.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2005
from $10.4 million for the year ended September 30,
2004. Total pipeline transportation volumes were 563.9 Bcf
during the year ended September 30, 2005 compared with
9.4 Bcf for the prior year. Excluding intersegment
transportation volumes, total pipeline transportation volumes
were 375.6 Bcf during the current year.

The increase in pipeline and storage gross profit margin
primarily reflects the impact of the acquisition of the Atmos
Pipeline — Texas Division resulting in an increase in
pipeline and storage gross profit margin and total
transportation volumes of $149.5 million and
375.6 Bcf. Also contributing to Atmos Pipeline —
Texas Division’s results were higher transportation and
related services margin due to significant basis differentials
at its three major Texas hubs. The $2.0 million decrease in
the gross profit generated by APS primarily reflects a decrease
in asset management fees received during fiscal 2005.

Operating expenses increased to $87.6 million for the year
ended September 30, 2005 from $5.1 million for the
year ended September 30, 2004 due to the addition of
$83.6 million in operating expenses associated with the
Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division. As the Atmos
Pipeline — Texas Division is a regulated entity,
franchise and state gross receipts taxes are paid by our
customers; thus, these amounts are offset in revenues through
customer billings and have no permanent effect on net income.
Included in operating expense was $8.9 million associated
with taxes other than income taxes, of which $8.3 million
was associated with our Atmos Pipeline — Texas
Division.

As a result of the aforementioned factors, our pipeline and
storage segment operating income for the year ended
September 30, 2005 increased to $70.3 million from
$5.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2004.

Interest charges

Interest charges allocated to this segment for the year ended
September 30, 2005 increased to $24.6 million from
$1.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2004.
The increase was attributable to the interest expense associated
with the issuance of long-term debt to finance the acquisition
of the Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division in October 2004.

Other nonutility segment

Our other nonutility businesses consist primarily of the
operations of Atmos Energy Services, LLC, and Atmos Power
Systems, Inc. Through AES, we provide natural gas management
services to our utility operations, other than the Mid-Tex
Division. These services, which began April 1, 2004,
include aggregating and purchasing gas supply, arranging
transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering
the gas to our utility service areas at competitive prices. The
revenues of AES represent charges to our utility divisions



equal to the costs incurred to provide those services. Through
Atmos Power Systems, Inc., we construct gas-fired electric
peaking power-generating plants and associated facilities and
may enter into agreements to either lease or sell these plants.

Operating income for our other nonutility segment primarily
reflects the leasing income associated with two sales-type lease
transactions completed in fiscal 2001 and 2002. The increase in
operating income during the year ended September 30, 2005
reflects the absence of a one-time charge of $0.4 million
associated with the wind-down of a noncore business during
fiscal 2004.

Miscellaneous income for the year ended September 30, 2005
was $2.6 million compared with $8.3 million for the
year ended September 30, 2004. The $5.7 million
decrease was attributable primarily to the recognition of a
$5.9 million pretax gain on the sale of all remaining
limited partnership interests in Heritage Propane Partners, L.P.
during fiscal 2004.

Year ended September 30, 2004 compared with year ended
September 30, 2003

Utility segment

Operating income

Utility gross profit margin increased to $503.1 million for
the year ended September 30, 2004 from $491.4 million
for the year ended September 30, 2003. Total throughput for
our utility business was 261.0 Bcf during the year compared
to 254.7 Bcf in the prior year. Excluding intercompany
throughput, consolidated throughput for our utility business was
246.0 Bcf during the year, compared with 248.0 Bcf in
the prior year.

The increase in utility gross profit margin primarily reflects
the impact of the acquisition of Mississippi Valley Gas Company
whose operations are included for the entire first quarter in
fiscal year 2004, compared with one month in the first quarter
of the prior fiscal year resulting in an increase in utility
gross profit margin and total throughput of $12.8 million
and 5.0 Bcf. Utility gross profit margin was also favorably
impacted by rate increases received in Kansas, Texas and
Mississippi and a $10.2 million year-over-year increase in
the effect of WNA in our WNA service areas. These increases were
partially offset by the impact of weather that was six percent
warmer than that of the prior year and four percent warmer than
normal, resulting in a decrease of approximately
$13.8 million and lower irrigation sales in our West Texas
Division resulting in a decrease of approximately
$2.1 million. Warmer than normal weather particularly
impacted our service areas in our Louisiana, Mid-States and West
Texas divisions. The decrease in throughput also reflects a
decrease in consumption attributable to the impact of
conservation and the continued introduction of more efficient
gas appliances in our service areas. Finally, our utility gross
profit margin for the year ended September 30, 2004
reflects a one-time reduction resulting from a regulatory ruling
to refund $1.9 million to our customers in our Colorado
service area.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes,
increased 3.9 percent to $343.2 million for the year
ended September 30, 2004 from $330.3 million for the
year ended September 30, 2003. Operation and maintenance
expense increased, primarily due to the addition of
$6.1 million related to the MVG acquisition in December
2002 and higher labor and benefit costs. Taxes other than income
taxes increased $1.5 million, primarily due to additional
franchise, payroll and property taxes associated with the MVG
assets acquired in December 2002. Franchise and state gross
receipts taxes are paid by our customers as a component of their
monthly bills; thus, these amounts are offset in revenues
through customer billings and have no effect on net income.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased
$9.1 million, which primarily reflects MVG depreciation for
the full year of fiscal 2004 compared with ten months in the
prior year. These increases were partially offset by a
$7.9 million reduction in our provision for doubtful
accounts attributable to continued improvement in accounts
receivable collections during fiscal 2004.

As a result of the aforementioned factors, our utility segment
operating income for the year ended September 30, 2004
decreased to $159.9 million from $161.1 million for
the year ended September 30, 2003.



Miscellaneous income (expense)

Miscellaneous income for the year ended September 30, 2004
was $5.8 million, compared with expense of
$0.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2003.
The $6.0 million change was attributable primarily to the
absence in 2004 of weather insurance amortization totaling
$5.0 million, which was recognized in the prior year due to
the termination of our weather insurance policy in the third
quarter of fiscal 2003 and the recognition of a
$0.8 million gain on the sale of real property during
fiscal 2004.

Interest charges

Interest charges increased 3.5 percent for the year ended
September 30, 2004 to $65.4 million from
$63.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2003.
The increase was attributable primarily to a higher average
outstanding debt balance resulting from the financing obtained
to fund the acquisition of MVG in December 2002.

Natural gas marketing segment

Operating income

Our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit margin was
comprised of the following for the years ended
September 30, 2004 and 2003:

Our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit was
$46.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2004
compared to gross profit margin of $24.2 million for the
year ended September 30, 2003. Natural gas marketing sales
volumes were 265.1 Bcf during the current year compared
with 294.8 Bcf for the prior year. Excluding intercompany
sales volumes, natural gas marketing sales volumes were
222.6 Bcf during the current year compared with
226.0 Bcf in the prior year. The decrease in consolidated
natural gas marketing sales volumes was primarily due to overall
warmer temperatures during the 2003-2004 heating season compared
with the prior year. Our natural gas marketing gross profit
margin for the year ended September 30, 2004 included an
unrealized loss on open contracts of $2.8 million compared
with an unrealized gain on open contracts of $6.3 million
in the prior year.

The contribution to gross profit from our storage activities was
a loss of $1.5 million for the year ended
September 30, 2004 compared to a loss of $1.9 million
for the year ended September 30, 2003. The
$0.4 million improvement primarily was attributable to a
$5.4 million improvement in the realized storage
contribution for the year ended September 30, 2004 compared
to the prior year offset by a $5.0 million decrease in
unrealized income associated with our storage portfolio compared
to the prior year. The improvement in the realized storage
contribution for the year ended September 30, 2004
primarily was due to



our inability during the 2002-2003 heating season to withdraw
planned volumes from storage to meet our customer requirements
caused by operational, contractual and regulatory limitations
relating to our storage facilities, which reduced our realized
storage contributions during fiscal 2003. This situation did not
recur in fiscal 2004. The decrease in unrealized income in the
current year was primarily attributable to a less favorable
movement during the year ended September 30, 2004 in the
forward indices used to value the storage financial instruments
than in the prior year combined with slightly lower physical
natural gas storage quantities at September 30, 2004
compared to the prior year.

Our marketing activities contributed $48.2 million to our
gross profit margin for the year ended September 30, 2004
compared to $26.1 million for the year ended
September 30, 2003. The increase in the marketing
contribution primarily was attributable to our continued efforts
to amend contracts with third parties to transfer risk to our
customers and to provide higher gross profit margins and
improved position management during the current year.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes,
increased to $18.9 million for the year ended
September 30, 2004 from $10.6 million for the year
ended September 30, 2003. The increase in operating expense
was attributable primarily to higher labor and benefit costs
resulting from the improvement in earnings for the fiscal year
and an increase in temporary and permanent personnel due to
systems and process improvements in the marketing segment.

The improved gross profit margin resulted in an increase in our
natural gas marketing segment operating income to
$27.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2004
compared with operating income of $13.6 million for the
year ended September 30, 2003.

Miscellaneous income

Miscellaneous income for the year ended September 30, 2004
was $0.8 million, compared with income of $1.9 million
for the year ended September 30, 2003. The
$1.1 million decrease was attributable primarily to lower
interest income earned on cash held on deposit in margin
accounts due to favorable valuations on our financial
derivatives, which reduced the need to deposit cash into margin
accounts.

Pipeline and storage segment

Operating income

Our pipeline and storage operating income decreased to
$5.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2004
from $11.8 million for the year ended September 30,
2003. The decrease in our pipeline and storage operating income
was primarily attributable to a decrease in demand charges
recognized by Atmos Pipeline and Storage, L.L.C. for storage
services provided during the year ended September 30, 2004
compared to the prior year and lower transported volumes of
approximately 2.3 Bcf by APS due to overall warmer weather
during the winter heating season. The decrease was also
attributable to a $1.5 million decrease in monthly
facilities fees charged by Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline, Inc. as
a result of a settlement reached with the Louisiana Public
Service Commission in October 2003. Our pipeline and storage
operating income for the year ended September 30, 2004 also
included an unrealized loss on open contracts of
$1.1 million compared with no unrealized gain our loss in
the prior year as APS started to hedge its storage inventory
during the fourth quarter of 2004.

Other nonutility segment

Operating income

Our other nonutility operating income decreased to
$0.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2004
from $1.3 million for the year ended September 30,
2003. The decrease in our other nonutility operating income was
attributable primarily to a one-time charge of $0.4 million
associated with the wind-down of a noncore business.



Miscellaneous income

Miscellaneous income for the year ended September 30, 2004
was $8.3 million, compared with income of $6.5 million
for the year ended September 30, 2003. The
$1.8 million increase was attributable primarily to a
$5.9 million pretax gain associated with the sale in
January 2004 of our general and limited partnership interests in
USP and the sale in June 2004 of the remaining limited
partnership units in Heritage Propane Partners, L.P. formerly
owned by USP. This increase was offset partially by lower equity
earnings from our investment in USP resulting from the sale and
the absence in 2004 of a $3.9 million gain recorded in 2003
associated with a sales-type lease of a distributed electric
generation plant.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our working capital and liquidity for capital expenditure and
other cash needs are provided from internally generated funds,
borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper
program and funds raised from the public debt and equity capital
markets. We believe that these sources of funds will provide the
necessary working capital and liquidity for capital expenditures
and other cash needs for fiscal 2006. However, during fiscal
2006, we anticipate that higher natural gas prices primarily
resulting from the recent natural disasters will increase our
need to utilize our short-term credit facilities to temporarily
finance the purchase of natural gas to fulfill our contractual
obligations. These facilities are described in greater detail
below and in Note 6 to the consolidated financial
statements.

Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, including
short-term debt, was 59.3 percent and 43.3 percent at
September 30, 2005 and 2004. The increase in the debt to
capitalization ratio was attributable to the issuance of
$1.39 billion in senior unsecured long-term debt, partially
offset by the issuance of 16.1 million shares of our common
stock in October 2004 to partially finance the TXU Gas
acquisition. Our ratio of total debt to capitalization is
typically greater during the winter heating season as we make
additional short-term borrowings to fund natural gas purchases
and meet our working capital requirements. Within three to five
years from the closing of the TXU Gas acquisition, we intend to
reduce our capitalization ratio to a target range of 50 to
55 percent through cash flow generated from operations,
continued issuance of new common stock under our Direct Stock
Purchase Plan and Retirement Savings Plan, access to the equity
capital markets and reduced annual maintenance and capital
expenditures.

Cash Flows

Our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a
number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These
include regulatory changes, the price for our products and
services, the demand for such products and services, margin
requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity
prices, operational risks and other factors.



Cash flows from operating activities

Year-over-year changes in our operating cash flows are
attributable primarily to working capital changes within our
utility segment resulting from the impact of weather, the price
of natural gas and the timing of customer collections, payments
for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries.

For the year ended September 30, 2005, we generated
operating cash flow of $386.9 million compared with
$270.7 million in fiscal 2004 and $49.5 million in
fiscal 2003. The significant factors impacting our operating
cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below.

Year ended September 30, 2005

Fiscal 2005 operating cash flows reflect the effects of a
$49.6 million increase in net income and effective working
capital management partially offset by higher natural gas
prices. Working capital management efforts, which affected the
timing of payments for accounts payable and other accrued
liabilities, favorably affected operating cash flow by
$354.1 million. However, these efforts were partially
offset by reduced cash flow generated from accounts receivable
changes by $168.9 million, primarily attributable to higher
natural gas prices, and an increase in our natural gas
inventories attributable to a 13 percent year-over-year
increase in natural gas prices coupled with increased natural
gas inventory levels, which reduced operating cash flow by
$81.8 million. Operating cash flow was also adversely
impacted by unfavorable movements in the indices used to value
our natural gas marketing segment risk management assets and
liabilities, which resulted in a net liability for the segment.
Accordingly, under the terms of the associated derivative
contracts, we were required to deposit $81.0 million into a
margin account.

Year ended September 30, 2004

Fiscal 2004 operating cash flows were favorably impacted by
several items. Improved customer collections during fiscal 2004,
compared with the prior year, resulted in a $62.2 million
increase in operating cash flow. Further, cash used for natural
gas inventories decreased by $33.8 million compared with
the prior year. The decrease was attributable to lower
injections of natural gas into storage, partially offset by
higher prices. The reduction in the lag between the time period
when we purchase our natural gas and the period in which we can
include this cost in our gas rates improved operating cash flow
by $65.7 million. Changes in cash held on deposit in margin
accounts resulted in an increase in operating cash flow of
$25.6 million. This account represents deposits recorded to
collateralize certain of our financial derivatives purchased in
support of our natural gas marketing activities. The favorable
change was attributable to the fact that the fair value of
financial instruments held by AEM represented a net asset
position at September 30, 2004, which eliminated the need
to place cash in margin accounts. Finally, other working capital
and other changes improved operating cash flow by
$33.9 million. These changes primarily related to various
increases in deferred credits and other liabilities, other
current liabilities and income taxes payable partially offset by
lower deferred income tax expense as compared with the prior
year.

Year ended September 30, 2003

Fiscal 2003 operating cash flow was adversely impacted by a
$60.0 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher
revenues and the timing of customer account collections. The
increase in revenues was attributable to a 19 percent
increase in consolidated utility throughput as a result of the
impact of our MVG acquisition. Operating cash flow was also
adversely impacted by a significant increase in natural gas
prices. These increases resulted in a $64.9 million
increase in gas stored underground and a $24.2 million
increase in deferred gas costs. Finally, operating cash flow
reflects the impact of the funding of our pension plan in June
2003, which included a $48.6 million cash payment.

Cash flows from investing activities

During the last three years, a substantial portion of our cash
resources was used to fund acquisitions, our ongoing
construction program to provide natural gas services to our
customer base, enhance the integrity of our pipelines and
improvements to information systems.



For the year ended September 30, 2005, we incurred
$333.2 million for capital expenditures compared with
$190.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2004
and $159.4 million for the year ended September 30,
2003. Capital expenditures for the year ended September 30,
2005 include approximately $115.0 million for the Atmos
Energy Mid-Tex Division and $31.4 million for the Atmos
Pipeline — Texas Division.

Our cash used for investing activities for the year ended
September 30, 2005 reflects the $1.9 billion cash paid
for the TXU Gas acquisition including related transaction costs
and expenses. Cash flow from investing activities for the year
ended September 30, 2004 reflect the receipt of
$27.9 million from the sale of our limited and general
partnership interests in USP and Heritage Propane Partners, L.P.
and from the sale of a building.

Cash flows from financing activities

For the year ended September 30, 2005, our financing
activities provided $1.7 billion in cash compared with
$80.4 million and $151.6 million provided for the
years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003. Our significant
financing activities for the years ended September 30,
2005, 2004 and 2003 are summarized as follows:



During the year ended September 30, 2005 we issued
1.6 million shares of common stock through various plans in
addition to the 16.1 million common shares issued in our
October 2004 public offering, which generated net proceeds of
$37.2 million. The following table shows the number of
shares issued for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004
and 2003:

Shelf Registration

In December 2001, we filed a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue, from
time to time, up to $600.0 million in new common stock
and/or debt. The registration statement was declared effective
by the SEC on January 30, 2002. On January 16, 2003,
we issued $250.0 million of 5.125% Senior Notes due in
2013 under the registration statement. The net proceeds of
$249.3 million were used to repay debt under an acquisition
credit facility used to finance our acquisition of MVG, to repay
$54.0 million in unsecured senior notes held by
institutional lenders and short-term debt under our commercial
paper program and for general corporate purposes. Additionally,
we sold 4.1 million shares of our common stock in
connection with our 2003 Offering under the registration
statement to provide additional funding for our Pension Account
Plan. In July 2004, we sold 9.9 million shares of our
common stock, including the underwriters’ exercise of their
overallotment option, which exhausted the remaining availability
under this registration statement.

In August 2004, we filed a registration statement with the SEC
to issue, from time to time, up to $2.2 billion in new
common stock and/or debt, which became effective on
September 15, 2004. In October 2004, we sold
16.1 million common shares, including the
underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option of
2.1 million shares, under the new registration statement,
generating net proceeds of $382.5 million before other
offering costs. Additionally, we issued senior unsecured debt
under the registration statement consisting of $400 million
of 4.00% Senior Notes due 2009, $500 million of
4.95% Senior Notes due 2014, $200 million of
5.95% Senior Notes due 2034 and $300 million of
floating rate Senior Notes due 2007. The floating rate notes
bear interest at a rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus
0.375 percent per year. The initial weighted average
effective interest rate on these notes was 4.76 percent.
The net proceeds from the sale of these senior notes were
$1.39 billion.

The net proceeds from the October 2004 common stock and senior
notes offerings, combined with the net proceeds from our July
2004 offering were used to pay off the $1.7 billion in
outstanding commercial paper backstopped by a senior unsecured
revolving credit agreement, which we entered into on
September 24, 2004 for bridge financing for the TXU Gas
acquisition. After issuing the debt and equity in October 2004
we have approximately $401.5 million of availability
remaining under this registration statement.



Credit Facilities

We maintain both committed and uncommitted credit facilities.
Borrowings under our uncommitted credit facilities are made on a
when-and-as-needed basis at the discretion of the bank. Our
credit capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are
affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and
our short-term borrowing requirements, which are typically
highest during colder winter months. Our working capital needs
can vary significantly due to changes in the price of natural
gas charged by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required
to meet customers’ needs during periods of cold weather.
Our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures have
increased substantially as a result of the acquisition of the
natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of TXU Gas. On
October 22, 2004, we replaced our $350.0 million
credit facility with a new $600.0 million committed credit
facility that serves as a backup liquidity facility for our
commercial paper program. We believe this facility, combined
with our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund these
increased working capital needs. On March 30, 2005, AEM
amended and extended its uncommitted demand working capital
credit facility to March 31, 2006. At September 30,
2005, there was $129.9 million outstanding under our
commercial paper program and $14.9 million outstanding
under our bank credit facilities. These facilities are described
in further detail in Note 6 to the consolidated financial
statements.

In anticipation of increased short-term liquidity needs due to
the recent increases in natural gas prices, we worked with our
regulators, who approved an increase in the amounts available to
our utility operations under short-term credit facilities to
$968.0 million, consisting of a new $600.0 million
3-year revolving credit facility to replace our existing
$600.0 million 364-day credit facility that expired in
October 2005, a new $300.0 million 364-day revolving credit
facility, a new $25.0 million uncommitted facility and our
existing $25.0 million uncommitted and $18.0 million
committed credit facilities. Additionally, we are working with
our lenders to obtain up to an additional $330.0 million of
capacity under our uncommitted demand working capital credit
facility to provide additional short-term liquidity to support
our natural gas marketing operations.

Credit Ratings

Our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain
short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the cost of
such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating
agencies consider a number of quantitative factors, including
debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to
outstanding debt, operating cash flow coverage of interest and
pension liabilities and funding status. In addition, the rating
agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our
earnings over time, the quality of our management and business
strategy, the risks associated with our utility and nonutility
businesses and the regulatory structures that govern our rates
in the states where we operate.

Our debt is rated by three rating agencies: Standard &
Poor’s Corporation, Moody’s Investors Service and
Fitch Ratings, Inc. Our current debt ratings are all considered
investment grade and are as follows:

S&P

Moody’s

Fitch

Long-term debt

BBB

Baa3

BBB+

Commercial paper

A-2

P-3

F-2

Currently, S&P and Moody’s maintain a stable outlook
and Fitch maintains a negative outlook. None of our ratings are
currently under review.

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
securities. All of our current ratings for long-term debt are
categorized as investment grade. The highest investment grade
credit rating for S&P is AAA, Moody’s is Aaa and Fitch
is AAA. The lowest investment grade credit rating for S&P is
BBB-, Moody’s is Baa3 and Fitch is BBB-. Our credit ratings
may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies,
and each rating should be evaluated independent of any other
rating. There can be no assurance that a rating will remain in
effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be
lowered, or withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its
judgment, circumstances so warrant.



Debt Covenants

We are required by the financial covenants in both of our
revolving credit facilities to maintain, at the end of each
fiscal quarter, a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of
no greater than 70 percent. At September 30, 2005, our
total-debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, as defined in such
facility, was 61 percent.

AEM is required by the financial covenants in its uncommitted
demand working capital facility to maintain a maximum ratio of
total liabilities to tangible net worth of 5 to 1, along
with minimum levels of net working capital ranging from
$20 million to $50 million. Additionally, AEM must
maintain a minimum tangible net worth ranging from
$21 million to $51 million, and its maximum cumulative
loss from March 30, 2005 cannot exceed $4 million to
$10 million, depending on the total amount of borrowing
elected from time to time by AEM. At September 30, 2005,
AEM’s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth, as
defined in such facility, was 2.18 to 1.

Our Series P First Mortgage Bonds provide for certain cash
flow requirements and restrictions on additional indebtedness,
sale of assets and payment of dividends. Under the most
restrictive of such covenants, cumulative cash dividends paid
after December 31, 1985 may not exceed the sum of our
accumulated net income for periods after December 31, 1985
plus $9.0 million. At September 30, 2005,
approximately $157.9 million of retained earnings was
unrestricted with respect to the payment of dividends.

We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of
September 30, 2005. If we do not comply with our debt
covenants, we may be required to repay our outstanding balances
on demand, provide additional collateral or take other
corrective actions. Our two public debt indentures relating to
our senior notes and debentures, as well as our two revolving
credit agreements, each contain a default provision that is
triggered if outstanding indebtedness arising out of any other
credit agreements in amounts ranging from in excess of
$15 million to in excess of $100 million becomes due
by acceleration or is not paid at maturity. In addition,
AEM’s credit agreement contains a cross-default provision
whereby AEM would be in default if it defaults on other
indebtedness, as defined, by at least $250 thousand in the
aggregate. Additionally, this agreement contains a provision
that would limit the amount of credit available if Atmos were
downgraded below an S&P rating of BBB and a Moody’s
rating of Baa2.

Except as described above, we have no triggering events in our
debt instruments that are tied to changes in specified credit
ratings or stock price, nor have we entered into any
transactions that would require us to issue equity based on our
credit rating or other triggering events.



Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments

The following tables provide information about contractual
obligations and commercial commitments at September 30,
2005.

AEM has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural
gas under contracts indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed
price contracts. At September 30, 2005, AEM was committed
to purchase 32.3 Bcf within one year, 29.2 Bcf
between one to three years and 9.9 Bcf after three years
under indexed contracts. AEM was committed to
purchase 1.3 Bcf within one year and 0.4 Bcf
within one to three years under fixed price contracts with
prices ranging from $5.24 to $17.50.

With the exception of our Mid-Tex Division, our utility segment
maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally
cover a period of up to one year. Commitments for estimated base
gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly
basis at contractually negotiated prices. Commitments for
incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the
month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract.
Our Mid-Tex Division maintains long-term supply contracts to
ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service
area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market
prices. The estimated commitments under these contract terms as
of September 30, 2005 are reflected in the table above.

In January 2005, we signed a letter of intent with a third party
to jointly construct, own and operate a 45-mile large diameter
natural gas pipeline in the northern portion of the Dallas/
Fort Worth Metroplex. Under terms of the letter of intent,
the third party will provide the initial capital to build the
pipeline and we expect to contribute $45.0 million within
two years of signing a definitive agreement. We expect to execute



this agreement during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and the
pipeline is currently expected to be placed into service in
fiscal 2006. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2005, we
entered into two agreements with third parties to transport
natural gas through our Texas intrastate pipeline system
beginning in fiscal 2006. To handle the increased volumes for
these projects, we will install compression equipment and other
pipeline infrastructure. We expect to spend approximately
$32.0 million in 2006 for these projects.

Risk Management Activities

We conduct risk management activities through both our utility
and natural gas marketing segments. In our utility segment, we
use a combination of storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed
financial contracts to partially insulate us and our customers
against gas price volatility during the winter heating season.
In our natural gas marketing segment, we manage our exposure to
the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross
profit margin through a combination of storage and financial
derivatives, including futures, over-the-counter and
exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties.
Finally, during fiscal 2004, we entered into four Treasury lock
agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest
cost of financing associated with the anticipated issuance of
$875 million of long-term debt. These Treasury lock
agreements were settled in October 2004 with a net
$43.8 million payment to the counterparties. Approximately
$11.6 million of the $43.8 million obligation will be
recognized as a component of interest expense over a five year
period from the date of settlement, and the remaining amount,
approximately $32.2 million, will be recognized as a
component of interest expense over a ten year period from the
date of settlement. Our risk management activities and related
accounting treatment are described in further detail in
Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

We record our derivatives as a component of risk management
assets and liabilities, which are classified as current or
noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the
underlying derivative. Substantially all of our derivative
financial instruments are valued using external market quotes
and indices. The following table shows the components of the
change in fair value of our utility and natural gas marketing

Storage and Hedging Outlook

AEM participates in transactions in which it seeks to find and
profit from pricing differences that occur over time. AEM
purchases physical natural gas and then sells financial
contracts at favorable prices to lock in gross profit margins.
AEM is able to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage
of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing
pricing differences that occur over time.

Natural gas inventory is marked to market monthly using the
iFERC price at the end of each month with changes in fair value
recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of
change. Derivatives associated with our natural gas inventory,
which are designated as fair value hedges, are marked to market
each month based upon the NYMEX price with changes in fair value
recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of
change. The changes in the difference between the indices used
to mark to market our physical inventory (iFERC) and the related
fair-value hedge (NYMEX) is reported as a component of
revenue and can result in volatility in our reported net income.
Over time, gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory
will be offset by gains and losses on the fair-value hedges;
therefore, the economic gross profit AEM captured in the
original transaction remains essentially unchanged.

AEM continually manages its positions to enhance the future
economic profit it captured in the original transaction.
Therefore, AEM may change its scheduled injection and withdrawal
plans from one time period to another based on market conditions
or adjust the amount of storage capacity it holds on a
discretionary basis in an effort to achieve this objective. AEM
monitors the impacts of these profit optimization efforts by
estimating the forecasted gross profit margin that it captured
through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the
associated financial derivatives. The forecasted gross profit
margin, less the effect of unrealized gains or losses recognized
in the financial statements, provides a measure of the net
increase or decrease in the gross profit margin that could occur
in future periods if AEM’s optimization efforts are fully
successful.

As of September 30, 2005, based upon AEM’s derivatives
position and inventory withdrawal schedule, the forecasted gross
profit margin was approximately $13.0 million.
Approximately $14.8 million of net unrealized losses were
recorded in the financial statements as of September 30,
2005. Therefore, the projected increase in future gross profit
margin is approximately $27.8 million.

The forecasted gross profit margin calculation is based upon
planned injection and withdrawal schedules, and the realization
of the forecasted gross profit margin is contingent upon the
execution of this plan, weather and other execution factors.
Since AEM actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to
enhance the future profitability of its storage position, it may
change its scheduled injection and withdrawal plans from one
time period to another based on market conditions. Therefore, we
cannot assure that the forecasted gross profit margin or the
projected increase in future gross profit margin calculated as
of September 30, 2005 will be fully realized in the future
or in what time period. Further, if we experience operational or
other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our
stored gas positions, permanent impacts on earnings may result.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits Obligations

Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit
    Costs

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, our total net
periodic pension and other benefits costs was
$36.4 million, compared with $26.1 million and
$28.0 million for the years ended September 30, 2004
and 2003. A portion of these costs is capitalized into our
utility rate base, as these costs are recoverable through our
gas utility rates. Costs that are not capitalized are recorded
as a component of operation and maintenance expense.

The increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits
cost during fiscal 2005 compared with the prior year primarily
reflects an increase in our service cost associated with the
increase in the number of employees covered by our plans due to
the TXU Gas acquisition. Although we did not assume the existing
employee benefit liabilities or plans of TXU Gas, for purposes
of determining our annual pension cost we agreed to give the
transitioned employees credit for years of TXU Gas service under
our pension plan. With respect to our postretirement medical
plan, we received a credit of $18.9 million against the
purchase price to permit us to provide partial past service
credits for retiree medical benefits under our retiree medical
plan. The



$18.9 million credit approximates the actuarially
determined present value of the accumulated benefits related to
the past service of the transferred employees on the acquisition
date.

In addition to the increased number of employees covered by the
plans, we changed the assumptions used to determine our fiscal
2005 benefit costs, which resulted in an increase in our net
periodic pension and postretirement costs. We increased the
discount rate by 25 basis points and we reduced our
expected return on our pension plan assets by 25 basis
points. These assumption changes decreased the service cost and
interest cost and reduced the expected return components of our
pension and postretirement benefits costs.

The decrease in total net periodic pension and other benefits
cost during fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily
reflects the impact of adopting the provisions of the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003
(the Act), beginning with the second quarter of 2004, which
reduced our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
$24.3 million and our net postretirement benefit obligation
costs by $4.1 million. The total income statement impact
was $2.3 million as a portion of this benefit was
capitalized.

Further, the expected return on plan assets, which reduces our
net pension and postretirement costs, increased as compared with
the prior year primarily due to an increase in total assets
attributable to the full year effect of the contributions we
made to the Atmos Pension Account Plan in fiscal 2003 and the
inclusion of the MVG pension plan assets during fiscal 2003
partially offset by a 25 basis point decrease in the
expected return on plan asset assumption used to determine
fiscal 2004 net periodic pension cost.

These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the
service cost and the recognized actuarial loss attributable to a
125 basis point decrease in the discount rate used to
determine our fiscal 2004 net periodic pension and other
benefits costs compared with the discount rate used to determine
our fiscal 2003 costs, resulting from a decrease in interest
rates in the period leading up to our June 30 measurement
date.

Pension and Postretirement Plan Funding

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an
amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. However, additional
voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered
necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for
benefits attributed to service to date but also for those
expected to be earned in the future.

During fiscal 2005, we voluntarily contributed $3.0 million
to the Atmos Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust (the
Trust) to maintain the level of funding we desire relative to
our accumulated benefit obligation. We elected to contribute to
the Trust because declining high yield corporate bond yields in
the period leading up to our June 30, 2005 measurement date
resulted in an increase in the present value of our plan
liabilities. In June 2003, we contributed to the Trust for the
benefit of the Atmos Energy Corporation Pension Account Plan
$48.6 million in cash and 1,169,700 shares of Atmos
restricted common stock with the-then market value of
$28.8 million. We did not contribute to our pension plans
during fiscal 2004.

We contributed $10.0 million, $13.8 million and
$18.6 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the
years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The
contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs
we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum
funding required by our regulators.

Outlook for Fiscal 2006

As noted above, high grade corporate bond yields were decreasing
in the period leading up to our June 30, 2005 measurement
date. Therefore, we reduced the discount rate for determining
our fiscal 2006 pension and benefit costs by 125 basis
points to 5 percent. Additionally, we reduced the expected
return on our pension plan assets by 25 basis points to
8.5 percent. The effect of these assumption changes,
coupled with the effects of updating our annual valuation will
result in an increase in our net pension and postretirement
costs of approximately $15 million.



We are not required to make a minimum funding contribution to
our pension plans during fiscal 2006 nor, at this time, do we
intend to make voluntary contributions during 2006. However, we
anticipate contributing approximately $11.9 million to our
postretirement medical plans during fiscal 2006.

The projected pension liability, future funding requirements and
the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the Plan
are subject to change, depending upon the actuarial value of
plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations
as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date. These amounts
are impacted by actual investment returns, changes in interest
rates and changes in the demographic composition of the
participants in the plan.

RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

Recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows are described in
Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

We are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and
interest rates. Commodity price risk is the potential loss that
we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a
particular instrument or commodity. Interest-rate risk results
from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue
to provide financing and liquidity for our business.

We conduct risk management activities through both our utility
and natural gas marketing segments. In our utility segment, we
use a combination of storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed
financial contracts to partially insulate us and our customers
against gas price volatility during the winter heating season.
In our natural gas marketing segment, we manage our exposure to
the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross
profit margin through a combination of storage and financial
derivatives including futures, over-the-counter and
exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties.
Our risk management activities and related accounting treatment
are described in further detail in Note 5 to the
consolidated financial statements. Additionally, our earnings
are affected by changes in short-term interest rates as a result
of our issuance of short-term commercial paper, the issuance of
floating rate debt in October 2004 and our other short-term
borrowings.

Commodity Price Risk

Utility segment

We purchase natural gas for our utility operations.
Substantially all of the cost of gas purchased for utility
operations is recovered from our customers through purchased gas
adjustment mechanisms. However, our utility operations have
commodity price risk exposure to fluctuations in spot natural
gas prices related to purchases for sales to our non-regulated
energy services customers at fixed prices.

For our utility segment, we use a sensitivity analysis to
estimate commodity price risk. For purposes of this analysis, we
estimate commodity price risk by applying a hypothetical 10
percent increase in the portion of our gas cost related to
fixed-price non-regulated sales. Based on these projected
non-regulated gas sales, a hypothetical 10 percent increase
in fixed prices based upon the September 30, 2005 three
month market strip would increase our purchased gas cost by
approximately $5.9 million in fiscal 2006.

Natural gas marketing and pipeline and storage
    segments

Our natural gas marketing segment is also exposed to risks
associated with changes in the market price of natural gas. For
our natural gas marketing segment, we use a sensitivity analysis
to estimate commodity price risk. For purposes of this analysis,
we estimate commodity price risk by applying a $0.50 change in
the forward NYMEX price to our net open position (including
existing storage and related financial contracts) at the end of
each period. Because AEH did not have any net open positions
(including existing storage and related financial contracts) at
September 30, 2005, there would be no impact on our
consolidated net income due to fluctuations in the forward NYMEX
price.



However, changes in the difference between the indices used to
mark to market our physical inventory (iFERC) and the related
fair-value hedge (NYMEX) can result in volatility in our
reported net income; however, over time, gains and losses on the
sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses
on the fair-value hedges. Based upon our storage position at
September 30, 2005 of 7.4 Bcf, a $0.50 change in the
difference between the iFERC and NYMEX indices could impact our
reported net income by approximately $2.3 million.

Interest Rate Risk

Our earnings are exposed to changes in short-term interest rates
associated with our short-term commercial paper program, other
short-term borrowings and floating rate debt. We use a
sensitivity analysis to estimate our short-term interest rate
risk. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our short-term
interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest
expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the
period assuming a hypothetical average of a one percent increase
in the interest rates associated with our short-term borrowings.
Had interest rates associated with our short-term borrowings
outstanding during fiscal 2005 increased by an average of one
percent, our interest expense would have increased by
approximately $0.4 million during 2005.

We also assess market risk for our fixed-rate, long-term
obligations. We estimate market risk for our fixed-rate,
long-term obligations as the potential increase in fair value
resulting from a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest
rates associated with these debt instruments. Fair value is
estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. Assuming this
one percent hypothetical decrease, the fair value of our
fixed-rate, long-term obligations outstanding as of
September 30, 2005 would have increased by approximately
$160.2 million.

As of September 30, 2005, we were not engaged in any other
activities which would cause exposure to the risk of material
earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or
market commodity prices.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board of Directors

Atmos Energy Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Atmos Energy Corporation as of September 30, 2005 and 2004,
and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended September 30, 2005. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at Item 8. These financial statements and schedule
are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the

standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Atmos Energy Corporation at
September 30, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended September 30, 2005, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial
information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Atmos Energy Corporation’s internal
control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2005,
based on criteria established in Internal Control —

Nature of Business

Atmos Energy Corporation (“Atmos” or “the
Company”) and its subsidiaries are engaged primarily in the
natural gas utility business as well as certain nonutility
businesses. Through our natural gas utility business, we
distribute natural gas through sales and transportation
arrangements to approximately 3.2 million residential,
commercial, public-authority and industrial customers through
our seven regulated natural gas utility divisions, in the
service areas described below:

(1)

Acquired in October 2004.

(2)

The name of this division was changed from the Mississippi
    Valley Gas Company Division in April 2005.

(3)

Denotes locations where we have more limited service areas.

As further described in Note 3, on October 1, 2004, we
completed our acquisition of the natural gas distribution and
pipeline operations of TXU Gas Company. The TXU Gas operations
we acquired are regulated businesses engaged in the purchase,
transmission, storage, distribution and sale of natural gas in
the north-central, eastern and western parts of Texas. We also
acquired a system consisting of 6,162 miles of gas
transmission and gathering lines and five underground storage
reservoirs, all within Texas. As a result of the TXU Gas
acquisition, on October 1, 2004, we created the Atmos
Energy Mid-Tex Division, which provides gas distribution
services to our approximately 1.5 million residential and
business customers in Texas, including the Dallas/
Fort Worth metropolitan area. We also created the Atmos
Pipeline — Texas Division to manage and operate the
TXU Gas pipeline and storage operations we acquired.

In addition, we transport natural gas for others through our
distribution system. Our utility business is subject to federal
and state regulation and/or regulation by local authorities in
each of the states in which the utility divisions operate. Our
shared-services division is located in Dallas, Texas, and our
customer support centers are located in Amarillo, Texas, and
Metairie, Louisiana. In addition, on April 1, 2005, we took
over the operations of a Waco, Texas customer support center,
and all call center services formerly provided by TXU Gas
under a transitional services agreement were terminated. We
closed the purchase of the related assets on October 3,
2005 for approximately $1.7 million.

Our nonutility businesses operate in 22 states and include
our natural gas marketing operations, our pipeline and storage
operations and our other nonutility operations. These operations
are either organized under or managed by Atmos Energy Holdings,
Inc., which is wholly-owned by the Company.

Our natural gas marketing operations are managed by Atmos Energy
Marketing, LLC, which is wholly-owned by AEH. AEM provides a
variety of natural gas management services to municipalities,
natural gas utility systems and industrial natural gas
customers, primarily in the southeastern and midwestern states
and to our Kentucky, Louisiana and Mid-States divisions. These
services consist primarily of furnishing natural gas supplies at
fixed and market-based prices, contract negotiation and
administration, load forecasting, gas



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

storage acquisition and management services, transportation
services, peaking sales and balancing services, capacity
utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of
derivative instruments.

Our pipeline and storage operations consist of the operations of
our Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division, a division of
Atmos Energy Corporation, and of Atmos Pipeline and Storage,
LLC, which is wholly-owned by AEH. The Atmos Pipeline–Texas
Division was purchased from TXU Gas and transports natural gas
to the Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division, transports natural gas to
third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in
Texas. Through APS, we own or have an interest in underground
storage fields in Kentucky and Louisiana. We also use these
storage facilities to reduce the need to contract for additional
pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods.

Our other nonutility businesses consist primarily of the
operations of Atmos Energy Services, LLC and Atmos Power
Systems, Inc., which are wholly-owned by AEH. Through AES, we
provide natural gas management services to our utility
operations, other than the Mid-Tex Division. These services,
which began on April 1, 2004, include aggregating and
purchasing gas supply, arranging transportation and storage
logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our utility
service areas at competitive prices. Through Atmos Power
Systems, Inc., we construct gas-fired electric peaking
power-generating plants and associated facilities and may enter
into agreements to either lease or sell these plants.

Prior to January 20, 2004, United Cities Propane Gas, Inc.,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEH, owned an approximate
19 percent membership interest in U.S. Propane L.P., a
joint venture formed in February 2000 with three other utility
companies. Through our ownership in USP, we owned an approximate
5 percent indirect interest in Heritage Propane Partners,
L.P. During 2004, we sold our interest in USP and Heritage. We
received cash proceeds of $26.6 million and recorded a
pretax book gain of $5.9 million with these transactions.
We no longer have an interest in the propane industry.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation

— The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Atmos
Energy Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
material intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Basis of comparison

— Certain prior-year
amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year
presentation.

Use of estimates

— The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The most significant
estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, legal and
environmental accruals, insurance accruals, pension and
postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes, risk
management and trading activities and the valuation of goodwill,
indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Regulation

— Our utility operations are subject
to regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of
accounting records and various other matters by the respective
regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. Our
accounting policies recognize the financial effects of the
ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various
regulatory commissions. Regulated utility operations are
accounted for in accordance with SFAS 71,

Accounting for
the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation.

This statement
requires cost-based, rate-regulated entities that meet certain
criteria to reflect the authorized recovery of costs due to
regulatory decisions in their financial statements. As a result,
certain costs are permitted to be capitalized rather than
expensed because they can be recovered through rates.

We record regulatory assets as a component of deferred charges
and other assets for costs that have been deferred for which
future recovery through customer rates is considered probable.
Regulatory liabilities are



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

recorded either on the face of the balance sheet or as a
component of current liabilities, deferred income taxes or
deferred credits and other liabilities when it is probable that
revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to
customers through the ratemaking process. Significant regulatory
assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2005 and 2004
included the following:

(1)

Fully amortized as of December 2004.

Currently authorized rates do not include a return on certain of
our merger and integration costs; however, we recover the
amortization of these costs. Merger and integration costs, net,
are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated
useful lives ranging up to 20 years. During the fiscal
years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we
recognized $2.3 million, $8.2 million and
$8.2 million in amortization expense related to these
costs. Environmental costs have been deferred to future rate
filings in accordance with rulings received from various
regulatory commissions.

During the third quarter of 2005, the Mid-States Division filed
a rate case in its Georgia service area seeking a rate increase
of $4.0 million. We anticipate that the rate case will be
finalized in November 2005. During 2005, our Mid-Tex, West Texas
and Atmos Pipeline — Texas divisions made GRIP filings
to include $94.6 million of capital expenditures in their
rate base which should result in additional revenue of
approximately $19.1 million. Rulings on these filings are
anticipated by January 4, 2006.

In September 2004, the Mississippi Public Service Commission
authorized additional annualized revenue of $4.7 million on
our Mississippi Division’s May 2004 filing, which became
effective on June 1, 2004. However, the MPSC originally
disallowed certain deferred costs totaling $2.8 million. In
connection with the modification of our rate design, the MPSC
reversed its decision regarding these costs, and we included
these costs into our rates in October 2005.

Revenue recognition

— Sales of natural gas to
our utility customers are billed on a monthly cycle basis;
however, the billing cycle periods for certain classes of
customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

periods used for financial reporting purposes. We follow the
revenue accrual method of accounting for utility segment
revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to
customers, but not yet billed under the cycle billing method,
are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to
expense. Revenue is recognized in our pipeline and storage
segment as the services are provided.

Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for
increases and decreases in our purchased gas cost through
purchased gas adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas adjustment
mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering
purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate
case to address all of the utility’s non-gas costs. These
mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities
recognize a particular type of expense, such as purchased gas
costs, that (i) is subject to significant price
fluctuations compared to the utility’s other costs,
(ii) represents a large component of the utility’s
cost of service and (iii) is generally outside the control
of the gas utility. There is no gross profit generated through
purchased gas adjustments, but they do provide a
dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or decreases in utility
gas costs. Although substantially all of our utility sales to
our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase,
utility gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations
in the cost of gas due to the purchased gas adjustment
mechanism. The effects of these purchased gas adjustment
mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance
sheet.

Energy trading contracts resulting in the delivery of a
commodity where we are the principal in the transaction are
recorded as natural gas marketing sales or purchases at the time
of physical delivery. Realized gains and losses from the
settlement of financial instruments that do not result in
physical delivery related to our natural gas marketing energy
trading contracts and unrealized gains and losses from changes
in the market value of open contracts are included as a
component of natural gas marketing revenues. For the years ended
September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we included unrealized
gains (losses) on open contracts of ($26.0) million,
($2.8) million and $6.3 million as a component of
natural gas marketing revenues.

Cash and cash equivalents

— We consider all
highly liquid investments with an initial or remaining maturity
of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful
accounts

— Accounts receivable consist of natural
gas sales to residential, commercial, industrial, municipal,
agricultural and other customers. For the majority of our
receivables, we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts
based on our collections experience. On certain other
receivables where we are aware of a specific customer’s
inability or reluctance to pay, we record an allowance for
doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net
receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to
collect. However, if circumstances change, our estimate of the
recoverability of accounts receivable could be different.
Circumstances which could affect our estimates include, but are
not limited to, customer credit issues, the level of natural gas
prices, customer deposits and general economic conditions.
Accounts are written off once they are deemed to be
uncollectible.

Gas stored underground

— Our gas stored
underground is comprised of natural gas injected into storage to
support the winter season withdrawals for our utility operations
and natural gas held by our natural gas marketing and other
nonutility subsidiaries to conduct their operations. The average
cost method is used for all our utility divisions, except for
the Mid-States Division, where it is valued on the first-in
first-out method basis, in accordance with regulatory
requirements. The average gas cost method is also used for our
natural gas marketing segment and our Atmos Pipeline —
Texas Division. Gas in storage that is retained as cushion gas
to maintain reservoir pressure is classified as property, plant
and equipment and is valued at cost.

Utility property, plant and equipment

— Utility
property, plant and equipment is stated at original cost net of
contributions in aid of construction. The cost of additions
includes direct construction costs, payroll related costs
(taxes, pensions and other fringe benefits), administrative and
general costs and an allowance for funds used during
construction. The allowance for funds used during construction
represents the estimated cost of funds used to finance the
construction of major projects and are capitalized in the rate
base for



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

ratemaking purposes when the completed projects are placed in
service. Interest expense of $2.5 million,
$1.2 million and $0.8 million was capitalized in 2005,
2004 and 2003.

Major renewals, including replacement pipe, and betterments that
are recoverable under our regulatory rate base are capitalized
while the costs of maintenance and repairs that are not
recoverable through rates are charged to expense as incurred.
The costs of large projects are accumulated in construction in
progress until the project is completed. When the project is
completed, tested and placed in service, the balance is
transferred to the utility plant in service account included in
the rate base and depreciation begins.

Utility property, plant and equipment is depreciated at various
rates on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives
of the assets. These rates are approved by our regulatory
commissions and are comprised of two components, one based on
average service life and one based on cost of removal.
Accordingly, we recognize our cost of removal expense as a
component of depreciation expense. The related cost of removal
accrual is reflected as a regulatory liability on the
consolidated balance sheet. At the time property, plant and
equipment is retired, removal expenses less salvage, are charged
to the regulatory cost of removal accrual. The composite
depreciation rate was 4.0 percent for the year ended
September 30, 2005 and 3.8 percent for the years ended
September 30, 2004 and 2003.

Nonutility property, plant and equipment

—
Nonutility property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation is generally computed on the straight-line method
for financial reporting purposes based upon estimated useful
lives ranging from 8 to 38 years.

Asset retirement obligations

— SFAS 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

requires that
we record a liability at fair value for an asset retirement
obligation when the legal obligation to retire the asset has
been incurred with an offsetting increase to the carrying value
of the related asset. Accretion of the asset retirement
obligation due to the passage of time is recorded as an
operating expense. As of September 30, 2005 and 2004, we
have asset retirement obligations as defined under
SFAS 143; however, we cannot determine when the legal
obligation will be incurred. Accordingly, we have not recorded a
liability for these obligations.

Impairment of long-lived assets

— We
periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have
occurred that indicate that other long-lived assets may not be
recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant
revision. When such events or circumstances are present, we
assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining
whether the carrying value will be recovered through the
expected future cash flows. In the event the sum of the expected
future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less
than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss equal
to the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair
value is recorded. To date, no impairment has been recognized.

Goodwill and intangible assets

— We annually
evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second
fiscal quarter or more frequently as impairment indicators
arise. We use a present value technique based on discounted cash
flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. These
calculations are dependent on several subjective factors
including the timing of future cash flows, future growth rates
and the discount rate. An impairment charge is recognized if the
carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its
fair value.

Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives of
10 years. These assets are reviewed for impairment as
impairment indicators arise. When such events or circumstances
are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets
by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered
through the expected future cash flows. In the event the sum of
the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the
asset is less than the carrying value of the asset, an
impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset’s carrying
value over its fair value is recorded. To date, no impairment
has been recognized.



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Marketable securities

— As of
September 30, 2005 and 2004, all of our marketable
securities were classified as available-for-sale securities
based upon the criteria of SFAS 115,

Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.

In
accordance with that standard, these securities are reported at
market value with unrealized gains and losses shown as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We
regularly evaluate the performance of these investments on a
fund by fund basis for impairment, taking into consideration the
fund’s purpose, volatility and current returns. If a
determination is made that a decline in fair value is other than
temporary, the related fund is written down to its estimated
fair value.

Derivatives and hedging activities

— Our
derivative and hedging activities are tailored to the segment to
which they relate. We record our derivatives as a component of
risk management assets and liabilities, which are classified as
current or noncurrent, based upon the anticipated settlement
date of the underlying derivative. These assets and liabilities
are recorded as components of other current assets, deferred
charges and other assets, other current liabilities or deferred
credits and other liabilities depending on the expiration or
maturity date of the instrument.

Utility Segment

In our utility segment, we use a combination of storage and
financial derivatives to partially insulate us and our natural
gas utility customers against gas price volatility during the
winter heating season. The financial derivatives we use in our
utility segment are accounted for under the mark-to-market
method pursuant to SFAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.

Changes in the valuation
of these derivatives primarily result from changes in the
valuation of the portfolio of contracts, maturity and settlement
of contracts and newly originated transactions. However, because
the gains or losses of financial derivatives used in our utility
segment will ultimately be recovered through our rates, current
period changes in the assets and liabilities from these risk
management activities are recorded as a component of deferred
gas costs in accordance with SFAS 71. Accordingly, there is
no earnings impact to our utility segment as a result of the use
of financial derivatives. The changes in the assets and
liabilities from risk management activities are recognized in
purchased gas cost in the income statement when the related gain
or loss is recovered through our rates.

Natural Gas Marketing Segment

Our natural gas marketing risk management activities are
conducted through AEM. AEM is exposed to risks associated with
changes in the market price of natural gas, and we manage our
exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes through a
combination of storage and financial derivatives, including
futures, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options and swap
contracts with counterparties. Option contracts provide the
right, but not the requirement, to buy or sell the commodity at
a fixed price. Swap contracts require receipt of payment for the
commodity based on the difference between a fixed price and the
market price on the settlement date. The use of these contracts
is subject to our risk management policies, which are monitored
for compliance daily.

We participate in transactions in which we combine the natural
gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs
incurred to serve our customers. Additionally, we engage in
natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and
profit from pricing differences that occur over time. We
purchase or sell physical natural gas and then sell or purchase
financial contracts at a price sufficient to cover our carrying
costs and provide a gross profit margin. Through the use of
transportation and storage services and derivatives, we are able
to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing
differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing
differences that occur over time.

Under SFAS 133, natural gas inventory is designated as the
hedged item in a fair-value hedge and is marked to market on a
monthly basis using the iFERC price at the end of each month.
Changes in fair value



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

are recognized as unrealized gains and losses in revenue in the
period of change. Costs to store the gas are recognized in the
period the costs are incurred. We recognize revenue and the
carrying value of the inventory as an associated purchased gas
cost in our consolidated statement of income when we sell the
gas and deliver it out of the storage facility.

Derivatives associated with our natural gas inventory are marked
to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with changes in
fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the
period of change. The difference in the indices used to mark to
market our physical inventory (iFERC) and the related fair-value
hedge (NYMEX) is reported as a component of revenue and can
result in volatility in our reported net income. Over time,
gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be
offset by gains and losses on the fair-value hedges, resulting
in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we
anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction.
In addition, we continually manage our positions to optimize
value as market conditions and other circumstances change.

Similar to our inventory position, we attempt to mitigate
substantially all of the commodity price risk associated with
our fixed-price contracts with minimum volume requirements
through the use of various offsetting derivatives. Prior to
April 1, 2004, these derivatives were not designated as
hedges under SFAS 133 because they naturally locked in the
economic gross profit margin at the time we entered into the
contract. The fixed-price forward and offsetting derivative
contracts were marked to market each month with changes in fair
value recognized as unrealized gains and losses recorded in
revenue in our consolidated statement of income. The unrealized
gains and losses are realized as a component of revenue in the
period in which we fulfill the requirements of the fixed-price
contract and the derivatives are settled. To the extent that the
unrealized gains and losses of the fixed-price forward contracts
and the offsetting derivatives did not offset exactly, our
earnings experienced some volatility. At delivery, the gains and
losses on the fixed-price contracts are offset by gains and
losses on the derivatives, resulting in the realization of the
economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we
structured the original transaction.

Effective April 1, 2004, we elected to treat our
fixed-price forward contracts as normal purchases and sales. As
a result, we ceased marking the fixed-price forward contracts to
market. We have designated the offsetting derivative contracts
as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions. As a result of
this change, unrealized gains and losses on these open
derivative contracts are now recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in
earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are
sold. Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred, is reported
as a component of revenues and is not material to our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we
continually manage our positions to optimize value as market
conditions and other circumstances change.

Treasury Activities

During fiscal 2004, we entered into four Treasury lock
agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest
cost of financing associated with the anticipated issuance of
$875 million of long-term debt. We designated these
Treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges of an anticipated
transaction. Accordingly, to the extent effective, unrealized
gains and losses associated with the Treasury lock agreements
are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income. These Treasury lock agreements were settled in October
2004 with a net $43.8 million payment to the
counterparties. Approximately $11.6 million of the
$43.8 million obligation will be recognized as a component
of interest expense over a five year period from the date of
settlement, and the remaining amount, approximately
$32.2 million, will be recognized as a component of
interest expense over a ten year period from the date of
settlement.

The fair value of our financial derivatives is determined
through a combination of prices actively quoted on national
exchanges, prices provided by other external sources and prices
based on models and other valuation methods. Changes in the
valuation of our financial derivatives primarily result from
changes in market prices, the valuation of the portfolio of our
contracts, maturity and settlement of these contracts and

newly originated transactions, each of which directly affect the
estimated fair value of our derivatives. We believe the market
prices and models used to value these derivatives represent the
best information available with respect to closing exchange and
over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility factors
underlying the contracts. Values are adjusted to reflect the
potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over
a reasonable period of time under present market conditions.

Pension and other postretirement plans

—
Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are
determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous
assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan
assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed
discount rates, and current demographic and actuarial mortality
data. We review the estimates and assumptions underlying our
pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities
annually based upon a June 30 measurement date. The assumed
discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that
generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs
and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health
care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally
have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan
costs and liabilities.

The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the
actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement
obligation and net pension and postretirement cost. When
establishing our discount rate, we consider absolute high
quality corporate bond rates based on Moody’s Aa bond
index, changes in those rates from the prior year and the
implied discount rate that is derived from matching our
projected benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate
bond spot rate curve.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in
calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the
annual pension and postretirement plan cost. We estimate the
expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond
returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of
active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset
rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the
guidance from our investment advisors in making final
determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the
extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the
course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate,
that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan cost is
not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases
future pension or postretirement plan cost over a period of
approximately ten to twelve years.

We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in
determining our postretirement net cost based upon our actual
health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted
legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of
retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our
participant census information as of the measurement date.

Income taxes

— Income taxes are provided based
on the liability method, which results in income tax assets and
liabilities arising from temporary differences. Temporary
differences are differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial
statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in
future years. The liability method requires the effect of tax
rate changes on current and accumulated deferred income taxes to
be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted.
The liability method also requires that deferred tax assets be
reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than
not that the assets will be realized.

Stock-based compensation plans

— We have two
stock-based compensation plans that provide for the granting of
incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights, bonus stock, restricted stock and
performance-based stock to officers and key employees: the 1998
Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Long-Term Stock Plan for the
Mid-States Division. Nonemployee directors are also eligible to
receive such stock-based compensation under the 1998 Long-Term
Incentive Plan. The objectives of these plans include attracting
and retaining the best personnel, providing for additional
performance incentives and promoting our success by providing
employees with the opportunity to acquire common stock. These
plans are

more fully described in Note 8. As permitted by
SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

,
we accounted for these plans under the intrinsic-value method
described in Accounting Principles Board
(APB) Opinion 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

through September 30, 2005. Under this
method, no compensation cost for stock options is recognized for
stock-option awards granted at or above fair-market value.

Awards of restricted stock are valued at the market price of the
Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The unearned
compensation is amortized to operation and maintenance expense
over the vesting period of the restricted stock. As discussed
below, beginning October 1, 2005 we will account for our
stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123
(revised),

Share-Based Payment.

Had compensation expense for our stock options issued under the
Long-Term Incentive Plan been recognized based on the fair value
on the grant date under the methodology prescribed by
SFAS 123, our net income and earnings per share for the
years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 would have
been impacted as shown in the following table:

Recent accounting pronouncements

— During 2003,
the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) added to its agenda
EITF Issue 03-01,

The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments

, to
address the meaning of “other-than-temporary”
impairment and its application to certain investments carried at
cost. In November 2003, the Task Force developed new disclosure
requirements concerning unrealized losses on available-for-sale
debt and equity securities accounted for under SFAS 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities.

We have adopted the disclosure



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

requirements prescribed by EITF 03-01, which are contained
in Note 9. In March 2004, the Task Force issued guidance
regarding the measurement and recognition of an
“other-than-temporary” impairment, which was
subsequently delayed in September 2004. In June 2005, the Task
Force decided not to provide additional guidance on the meaning
of “other-than-temporary” impairment. The project was
retitled FASB Staff Position (FSP) 115-1,

The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments

, which replaces the guidance found in
EITF 03-01 and states that the assessment of whether
impairment is “other-than-temporary” would be based
upon existing “other-than-temporary” impairment
guidance and the effective date for the use of this guidance
would be for reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2005. The final FSP is expected to be issued in fourth quarter
of calendar 2005 and should have no impact on our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised),

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123(R)). This standard
revises SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

and supersedes APB Opinion 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.

Under
SFAS 123(R), public companies will be required to measure
the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock
options and similar awards based on the grant-date fair value of
the award and recognize this cost in the income statement over
the period during which an employee is required to provide
service in exchange for the award. In April 2005, the Securities
and Exchange Commission deferred the required effective date of
SFAS 123(R) until the beginning of a registrant’s next
fiscal year. Accordingly, SFAS 123(R) will become effective
for the Company for fiscal 2006 beginning on October 1,
2005.

SFAS 123(R) allows companies to adopt the new standard
using the prospective, modified prospective or modified
retrospective method. We will adopt SFAS 123(R) as of
October 1, 2005 using the modified prospective method.
Under this method, we will recognize compensation cost, on a
prospective basis, for the portion of outstanding awards for
which the requisite service has not yet been rendered as of
October 1, 2005, based upon the grant-date fair value of
those awards calculated under SFAS 123 for pro forma
disclosure purposes. We expect that the adoption of
SFAS 123(R) will reduce our fiscal 2006 net income by
approximately $0.5 million.

In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

(FIN 47), which clarifies that an entity is required to
recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset
retirement obligation when the obligation is
incurred — generally upon acquisition, construction or
development and/or through the normal operation of the asset, if
the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. A
conditional asset retirement obligation is a legal obligation to
perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or
method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may
or may not be within the control of the entity. Uncertainty
about the timing and/or method of settlement is required to be
factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient
information exists. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity
would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the
fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 is
effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005.
We are currently evaluating the impact that FIN 47 may have
on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Acquisitions

TXU Gas Company

On October 1, 2004, we completed our acquisition of the
natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of TXU Gas
Company. The purchase was accounted for as an asset purchase.
The TXU Gas operations we acquired are regulated businesses
engaged in the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution and
sale of natural gas in the north-central, eastern and western
parts of Texas. Through these newly acquired operations, we
provide gas distribution services to approximately
1.5 million residential and business customers in Texas,
including the Dallas/ Fort Worth metropolitan area. We also
now own and operate a system consisting of 6,162 miles of
gas transmission and gathering lines and five underground
storage reservoirs in Texas.



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The purchase price for the TXU Gas acquisition was approximately
$1.9 billion (after closing adjustments and before
transaction costs and expenses), which we paid in cash. We
acquired approximately $112 million of working capital of
TXU Gas after the final working capital and capital expenditures
settlement was negotiated during the third quarter of 2005,
which resulted in a net payment to TXU Corporation of
approximately $4.1 million. We did not assume any
indebtedness of TXU Gas in connection with the acquisition. TXU
Gas retained certain assets, provided for the repayment of all
of its indebtedness and redeemed all of its preferred stock
prior to closing and retained and agreed to pay certain other
liabilities under the terms of the acquisition agreement.

We funded the purchase price for the TXU Gas acquisition with
approximately $235.7 million in net proceeds from our
offering of approximately 9.9 million shares of common
stock, which we completed on July 19, 2004, and
approximately $1.7 billion in net proceeds from our
issuance on October 1, 2004 of commercial paper backstopped
by a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement, which we
entered into on September 24, 2004 to provide bridge
financing for the TXU Gas acquisition. In October 2004, we paid
off the outstanding commercial paper used to fund the
acquisition through the issuance of senior unsecured notes on
October 22, 2004, which generated net proceeds of
approximately $1.39 billion, and the sale of
16.1 million shares of common stock on October 27,
2004, which generated net proceeds of $381.6 million.

The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed on October 1, 2004 (in
thousands):

The sale of TXU Gas’s assets was held through a competitive
bid process. We believe the resulting goodwill is recoverable
given the expected synergies we can achieve as a result of the
TXU Gas acquisition. To that end, the TXU Gas acquisition
significantly expands our existing utility operations in Texas.
The North Texas operations of TXU Gas bridge our geographic
operations between our existing utility operations in West Texas
and Louisiana. TXU Gas’s headquarters and service area are
centered in Dallas, Texas, which is also the location of our
corporate headquarters. Further, the addition of the regulated
pipelines and storage operations in North Texas may create
additional gas marketing and other opportunities for our
non-regulated subsidiaries, which include gas marketing and
storage operations. The goodwill generated in the acquisition is
deductible for tax purposes.



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At closing of the acquisition, TXU Gas and some of its
affiliates entered into transitional services agreements with us
to provide call center, meter reading, customer billing,
collections, information reporting, software, accounting,
treasury, administrative and other services to the Mid-Tex
Division. Some of these services were outsourced by TXU Gas to
Capgemini Energy L.P. However, on November 4, 2004, we
entered into an agreement with Capgemini Energy L.P. whereby we
took over the operations of the Waco, Texas call center on
April 1, 2005 and purchased from Capgemini Energy L.P. all
of the related call center assets on October 1, 2005. The
remaining transitional services agreements expired on
September 30, 2005 and were not renewed as we have
in-sourced all of these functions, effective October 1,
2005.

The table below reflects the unaudited pro forma results of the
Company and TXU Gas for the year ended September 30, 2004

ComFurT Gas Inc.

Effective March 1, 2004, we completed the acquisition of
the natural gas distribution assets of ComFurT Gas Inc., a
privately held natural gas utility and propane distributor based
in Buena Vista, Colorado, for approximately $2.0 million in
cash. This company served approximately 1,800 natural gas
utility customers. The acquisition enabled us to expand our
contiguous service area in our Colorado-Kansas division.
Unaudited pro forma results of the Company and ComFurT have not
been presented as the acquisition was not material to our
financial position or results of operations.

Mississippi Valley Gas Company

On December 3, 2002, we completed the acquisition of
Mississippi Valley Gas Company, Mississippi’s largest
natural gas utility. The acquisition of MVG enabled us to expand
our service area into Mississippi. MVG served approximately
261,500 residential, commercial, industrial and other customers
located primarily in the northern and central regions of
Mississippi. MVG’s rate design provides timely returns on
capital investment and earnings stability and enabled us to
leverage our existing centralized management structure, shared
services organization and information systems to manage costs in
all of Atmos Energy’s utility service areas over the long
term.

We paid approximately $74.7 million in cash and
$74.7 million in Atmos Energy common stock consisting of
3,386,287 unregistered shares. We also repaid approximately
$70.9 million of MVG’s outstanding debt. The results
of operations of MVG have been consolidated with our results of
operations from the acquisition date.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We conduct risk management activities through both our utility
and natural gas marketing segments. These activities are more
fully described in Note 2. Also, as discussed in
Note 2, we record our derivatives as a component of risk
management assets and liabilities, which are classified as
current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date
of the underlying derivative. Our determination of the fair
value of these derivative financial instruments reflects the
estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate or
close the contracts at the reporting date, taking into account
the current unrealized gains and losses on open contracts. In
our determination of fair value, we consider various factors,
including closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time
value and volatility factors underlying the contracts.

The following table shows the fair values of our risk management
assets and liabilities by segment at September 30, 2005 and
2004:

Utility Hedging Activities

We use a combination of storage, fixed physical contracts and
fixed financial contracts to partially insulate us and our
customers against gas price volatility during the winter heating
season. For the 2004-2005 heating season, we hedged
approximately 59 percent of our anticipated winter flowing
gas requirements at a weighted average cost of approximately
$6.23 per Mcf.

In June 2001, we purchased a three-year weather-insurance policy
with an option to cancel the third year of coverage. The
insurance covered our Texas and Louisiana operations to protect
against weather that was at least 7 percent warmer than
normal for the entire heating season of October through March,
beginning with the 2001-2002 heating season. The prepaid cost of
the three-year policy was $13.2 million and was amortized
over the appropriate heating seasons based on heating degree
days. In the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we cancelled this
policy, primarily as a result of rate relief in Louisiana and at
that time, prospects for weather normalization adjustments in
Texas. During fiscal 2003, we recognized amortization expense of
$5.0 million. However, we did not collect under this policy
because weather was not at least 7 percent warmer than
normal.

Our utility hedging activities also includes the fair value of
our treasury lock agreements which are described in further
detail below.



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Nonutility Hedging Activities

For the year ended September 30, 2005, the increase in the
deferred hedging gain in accumulated other comprehensive loss
was attributable to increases in future commodity prices
relative to the commodity prices stipulated in the derivative
contracts totaling $2.0 million and the recognition of
$10.4 million in net deferred hedge losses in net income
when the derivatives matured according to their terms. The net
deferred hedge gains associated with open cash flow hedges
remain subject to market price fluctuations until the positions
are either settled under the terms of the hedge contracts or
terminated prior to settlement. Substantially all of the
deferred hedging gain as of September 30, 2005 is expected
to be recognized in net income within the next fiscal year.

Under our risk management policies, we seek to match our
financial derivative positions to our physical storage positions
as well as our expected current and future sales and purchase
obligations to maintain no open positions at the end of each
trading day. The determination of our net open position as of
any day, however, requires us to make assumptions as to future
circumstances, including the use of gas by our customers in
relation to our anticipated storage and market positions.
Because the price risk associated with any net open position at
the end of each day may increase if the assumptions are not
realized, we review these assumptions as part of our daily
monitoring activities. We can also be affected by intraday
fluctuations of gas prices, since the price of natural gas
purchased or sold for future delivery earlier in the day may not
be hedged until later in the day. At times, limited net open
positions related to our existing and anticipated commitments
may occur. At the close of business on September 30, 2005,
AEH had no net open positions (including existing storage).

Adoption of EITF 02-03

On October 25, 2002, EITF 02-03,

Accounting for
Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management

,
was issued. It rescinded EITF 98-10,

Accounting for
Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities

, and required
that all energy trading contracts entered into after
October 25, 2002 be accounted for pursuant to the
provisions of SFAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.

Beginning
January 1, 2003, we have no longer marked our storage and
transportation contracts to market value each month in
accordance with EITF 98-10 and adopted EITF 02-03. As
a result, we recorded $7.8 million, net of applicable
income tax benefit, as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle in fiscal 2003.

Treasury Activities

During fiscal 2004, we entered into four Treasury lock
agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest
cost of financing associated with the-then anticipated issuance
of $875 million of long-term debt subsequent to
September 30, 2004. This long-term debt was issued on
October 22, 2004 and was used to repay a portion of the
commercial paper used to fund the TXU Gas acquisition, as
described in Note 3.

We designated these Treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges
of an anticipated transaction. Accordingly, to the extent
effective, unrealized gains and losses associated with the
Treasury locks were recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss. These Treasury lock agreements were settled
in October 2004 with a net $43.8 million payment to the
counterparties. Approximately $11.6 million of the
$43.8 million obligation will be recognized as a component
of interest expense over a five year period from the date of
settlement, and the remaining amount, approximately
$32.2 million, will be recognized as a component of
interest expense over a ten year period from the date of
settlement.

Debt

Long-term debt

Long-term debt at September 30, 2005 and 2004 consisted of
the following:

In December 2001, we filed a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue, from
time to time, up to $600.0 million in new common stock
and/or debt. The registration statement was declared effective
by the SEC on January 30, 2002. On January 16, 2003,
we issued $250.0 million of 5.125% Senior Notes due
2013 under the registration statement. The net proceeds of
$249.3 million were used to repay debt under an acquisition
credit facility used to finance our acquisition of MVG, to repay
$54.0 million in unsecured senior notes held by
institutional lenders and short-term debt under our commercial
paper program and to provide funds for general corporate
purposes. Additionally, we sold 4.1 million shares of our
common stock in connection with our June and July 2003 Offering
under the registration statement to provide additional funding
for our Pension Account Plan. In July 2004, we sold
9.9 million shares of our common stock, including the
underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option. We
used the net proceeds from this offering, together with
borrowings under a bridge financing facility to consummate the
acquisition of substantially all of the assets of TXU Gas and
pay related fees and expenses.



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As a result of the offering, we exhausted the remaining
availability under our December 2001 registration statement.

In August 2004, we filed another registration statement with the
SEC, which was declared effective by the SEC on
September 15, 2004, under which we may issue, from time to
time, up to $2.2 billion in new common stock and/or debt.
In October 2004, we sold 16.1 million common shares,
including the underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment
option, under the new registration statement, generating net
proceeds of $382.5 million before other offering costs.
Additionally, we issued senior unsecured debt under the
registration statement consisting of $400 million of
4.00% Senior Notes due 2009, $500 million of
4.95% Senior Notes due 2014, $200 million of
5.95% Senior Notes due 2034 and $300 million of
floating rate Senior Notes due 2007. The floating rate notes
will bear interest at a rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate
plus 0.375 percent per year. At September 30, 2005,
the interest rate on our floating rate debt was
3.974 percent. The net proceeds from the sale of these
senior notes were $1.39 billion.

The net proceeds from the October 2004 common stock and senior
notes offerings, combined with the net proceeds from our July
2004 offering were used to pay off the $1.7 billion in
outstanding commercial paper backstopped by a senior unsecured
revolving credit agreement, which we entered into on
September 24, 2004 for bridge financing for the TXU Gas
acquisition. After issuing the debt and equity in October 2004
we have approximately $401.5 million in availability
remaining under the registration statement. Also, as a result of
this refinancing in October 2004, we canceled the senior
unsecured revolving credit facility.

On June 30, 2005, we elected to utilize excess cash to
repay $72.5 million in principal on five series of our
First Mortgage Bonds prior to their scheduled maturity. In
connection with the repayment, we paid a $25.0 million
make-whole premium in accordance with the terms of the
agreements and accrued interest of approximately
$1.0 million. In accordance with regulatory requirements,
the premium has been deferred and will be recognized over the
remaining original lives of the First Mortgage Bonds that were
repaid.

Short-term debt

At September 30, 2005, there was $129.9 million
outstanding under our commercial paper program and
$14.9 million outstanding under our bank credit facilities.
At September 30, 2004, there were no short-term amounts
outstanding under our commercial paper program or bank credit
facilities.

Credit facilities

We maintain both committed and uncommitted credit facilities.
Borrowings under our uncommitted credit facilities are made on a
when-and-as-needed basis at the discretion of the bank. Our
credit capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are
affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and
our short-term borrowing requirements, which are typically
highest during colder winter months. Our working capital needs
can vary significantly due to changes in the price of natural
gas charged by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required
to meet customers’ needs during periods of cold weather.

Committed credit facilities

As of September 30, 2005, we had two short-term committed
revolving credit facilities totaling $618.0 million, one of
which was an unsecured facility for $600.0 million that
bears interest at the Eurodollar rate plus 0.625 percent
and served as a backup liquidity facility for our
$600.0 million commercial paper program. We entered into
this facility on October 22, 2004 to replace our
$350.0 million credit facility that served as the backup
liquidity facility for our $350.0 million commercial paper
program. At September 30, 2005, $129.9 million of
commercial paper was outstanding under this facility.

In October 2005, this facility expired and we replaced it with a
new $600.0 million 3-year revolving credit facility that
became effective October 18, 2005. This facility bears
interest at a rate ranging from LIBOR plus



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

0.40% to 1.00%. Based upon our current credit ratings,
borrowings would bear interest at our option of either a base
rate or LIBOR plus 0.55%. Additionally, the facility is subject
to quarterly commitment fees ranging from .075% to .200%,
dependent on our credit ratings. Based upon our current credit
ratings, the commitment fee is 0.100%. On November 10,
2005, a new $300.0 million 364-day revolving credit
facility became effective with substantially the same terms as
our $600.0 million facility.

We have a third unsecured facility in place for
$18.0 million that bears interest at the Federal Funds rate
plus 0.5 percent. This facility expired on March 31,
2005 and was renewed effective April 1, 2005 for an
additional twelve months with no material changes to its terms
and pricing. At September 30, 2005, $14.9 million was
outstanding under this facility.

The availability of funds under our credit facilities is subject
to conditions specified in the respective credit agreements, all
of which we currently meet. These conditions include our
compliance with financial covenants and the continued accuracy
of representations and warranties contained in these agreements.
We are required by the financial covenants in both revolving
credit facilities to maintain, at the end of each fiscal
quarter, a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no
greater than 70 percent. At September 30, 2005, our
total-debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, as defined, was
61 percent. In addition, both the interest margin over the
Eurodollar rate and the fee that we pay on unused amounts under
both revolving credit facilities are subject to adjustment
depending upon our credit ratings. The new revolving credit
facilities each contain the same limitation with respect to our
total-debt to-total capitalization ratio.

Uncommitted credit facilities

AEM had a $250.0 million uncommitted demand working capital
credit facility that bore interest at the Eurodollar rate plus
2.5 percent that was scheduled to expire on March 31,
2005. On March 30, 2005, the facility was amended and
extended to March 31, 2006. This facility is guaranteed by
AEH.

Borrowings under the amended facility can be made either as
revolving loans or offshore rate loans. Revolving loan
borrowings will bear interest at a floating rate equal to a base
rate (defined as the higher of 0.50% per annum above the
Federal Funds rate or the lender’s prime rate) plus 0.50%.
Offshore rate loan borrowings will bear interest at a floating
rate equal to a base rate based upon LIBOR plus an applicable
margin, ranging from 1.375% to 1.75% per annum, depending
on the excess tangible net worth of AEM, as defined in the
credit facility. Borrowings drawn down under letters of credit
issued by the banks will bear interest at a floating rate equal
to the base rate, as defined above plus an applicable margin,
which will range from 1.125% to 2.00% per annum, depending
on the excess tangible net worth of AEM and whether the letters
of credit are swap-related standby letters of credit.

AEM is required by the financial covenants in the credit
facility to maintain a maximum ratio of total liabilities to
tangible net worth of 5 to 1, along with minimum levels of
net working capital ranging from $20 million to
$50 million. Additionally, AEM must maintain a minimum
tangible net worth ranging from $21 million to
$51 million, and must not have a maximum cumulative loss
from March 30, 2005 exceeding $4 million to
$10 million, depending on the total amount of borrowing
elected from time to time by AEM. At September 30, 2005,
AEM’s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth, as
defined, was 2.18 to 1.

At September 30, 2005, no amounts were outstanding under
this credit facility. However, at September 30, 2005, AEM
letters of credit totaling $123.6 million had been issued
under the facility, which reduced the amount available by a
corresponding amount. The amount available under this credit
facility is also limited by various covenants, including
covenants based on working capital. Under the most restrictive
covenant, the amount available to AEM under this credit facility
was $26.3 million at September 30, 2005. This line of
credit is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of
AEM and is guaranteed by AEH.

We also have an unsecured short-term uncommitted credit line for
$25.0 million that is used for working capital and
letter-of-credit purposes. There were no borrowings under this
uncommitted credit facility at



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

September 30, 2005, but letters of credit reduced the
amount available by $4.2 million. This uncommitted line is
renewed or renegotiated at least annually with varying terms,
and we pay no fee for the availability of the line. Borrowings
under this line are made on a when- and as-available basis at
the discretion of the bank.

AEH, the parent company of AEM, has a $100.0 million
intercompany uncommitted demand credit facility with the Company
which bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.75%. This facility has been
approved by our state regulators through December 31, 2006.
At September 30, 2005, there was $51.3 million
outstanding under this facility.

In addition, AEM had a $100.0 million intercompany
uncommitted demand credit facility with AEH for its nonutility
business which bears interest at the LIBOR rate plus
2.75 percent. On July 1, 2005, this facility was
renewed and the amount available for borrowing was increased to
$120.0 million. Any outstanding amounts under this facility
are subordinated to AEM’s $250.0 million uncommitted
demand credit facility described above. This facility is used to
supplement AEM’s $250.0 million credit facility. At
September 30, 2005, there was $60.0 million
outstanding under this facility.

Debt Covenants

We have other covenants in addition to those described above.
Our Series P First Mortgage Bonds contain provisions that
allow us to prepay the outstanding balance in whole at any time,
after November 2007, subject to a prepayment premium. The First
Mortgage Bonds provide for certain cash flow requirements and
restrictions on additional indebtedness, sale of assets and
payment of dividends. Under the most restrictive of such
covenants, cumulative cash dividends paid after
December 31, 1985 may not exceed the sum of accumulated net
income for periods after December 31, 1985 plus
$9.0 million. At September 30, 2005 approximately
$157.9 million of retained earnings was unrestricted with
respect to the payment of dividends.

As of September 30, 2005, a portion of the Mid-States
Division utility plant assets, totaling $376.8 million, was
subject to a lien under the Indenture of Mortgage of the
Series P First Mortgage Bonds.

We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of
September 30, 2005. If we do not comply with our debt
covenants, we may be required to repay our outstanding balances
on demand, provide additional collateral or take other
corrective actions. Our two public debt indentures relating to
our senior notes and debentures, as well as both our revolving
credit agreements, each contain a default provision that is
triggered if outstanding indebtedness arising out of any other
credit agreements in amounts ranging from in excess of
$15 million to in excess of $100 million becomes due
by acceleration or is not paid at maturity. In addition,
AEM’s credit agreement contains a cross-default provision
whereby AEM would be in default if it defaults on other
indebtedness, as defined, by at least $250 thousand in the
aggregate. Additionally, this agreement contains a provision
that would limit the amount of credit available if Atmos were
downgraded below an S&P rating of BBB and a Moody’s
rating of Baa2.

Except as described above, we have no triggering events in our
debt instruments that are tied to changes in specified credit
ratings or stock price, nor have we entered into any
transactions that would require us to issue equity based on our
credit rating or other triggering events.

Based on the borrowing rates currently available to us for debt
with similar terms and remaining average maturities, the fair
value of long-term debt at September 30, 2005 and 2004 is
estimated, using discounted cash flow analysis, to be
$2,078.3 million and $936.6 million.

Shareholders’ Equity

Stock Issuances

During the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 we
issued 17,739,691, 11,323,925, and 9,799,853 shares of
common stock.

On February 9, 2005, our shareholders approved an amendment
to our Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of
authorized shares from 100 million to 200 million.

On October 27, 2004, we completed the public offering of
16.1 million shares of our common stock including the
underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option of
2.1 million shares. The offering was priced at $24.75 and
generated net proceeds of approximately $381.6 million. We
used the net proceeds from this offering, together with net
proceeds of $235.7 million from a public offering we
conducted in July 2004 and $1.39 billion received from the
issuance of senior unsecured notes to repay the
$1.7 billion in outstanding commercial paper described in
Note 3 and fund the remainder of the purchase price for the
TXU Gas acquisition.

On June 23, 2003, we completed a public offering of
4.0 million shares of our common stock, and we sold an
additional 100,000 shares of our common stock in July 2003
when our underwriters exercised their overallotment option (the
2003 Offering). The 2003 Offering was priced at $25.31 per
share and generated net proceeds of approximately
$99.2 million. The proceeds were used to partially fund our
pension plan, to repay short-term debt and for other general
corporate purposes including the purchase of natural gas for
storage.

Shareholder Rights Plan

On November 12, 1997, our Board of Directors declared a
dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of
our common stock to shareholders of record at the close of
business on May 10, 1998. Each right entitles the
registered holder to purchase from us a one-tenth share of our
common stock at a purchase price of $8.00 per share,
subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the rights
are set forth in a rights agreement between us and the rights
agent.

Subject to exceptions specified in the rights agreement, the
rights will separate from our common stock and a distribution
date will occur upon the earlier of:

•

ten business days following a public announcement that a person
    or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired, or
    obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of
    15 percent or more of the outstanding shares of our common
    stock, other than as a result of repurchases of stock by us or
    specified inadvertent actions by institutional or other
    shareholders;

•

ten business days, or such later date as our Board of Directors
    shall determine, following the commencement of a tender offer or
    exchange offer that would result in a person or group having



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership
    of 15 percent or more of the outstanding shares of our
    common stock; or

•

ten business days after our Board of Directors shall declare any
    person to be an adverse person within the meaning of the rights
    plan.

The rights expire on May 10, 2008, unless extended prior
thereto by our board or earlier if redeemed by us. The rights
will not have any voting rights. The exercise price payable and
the number of shares of our common stock or other securities or
property issuable upon exercise of the rights are subject to
adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution. We issue
rights when we issue our common stock until the rights have
separated from the common stock. After the rights have separated
from the common stock, we may issue additional rights if the
board of directors deems such issuance to be necessary or
appropriate. The rights have “anti-takeover” effects
and may cause substantial dilution to a person or entity that
attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of
directors except pursuant to an offer conditioned upon a
substantial number of rights being acquired. The rights should
not interfere with any merger or other business combination
approved by our board of directors because, prior to the time
that the rights become exercisable or transferable, we can
redeem the rights at $.01 per right.

Registration Rights and Other Agreements

As part of the consideration for our Mississippi Valley Gas
Company acquisition in December 2002, we issued shares of common
stock under an exemption from registration under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended. In the transaction, we entered into a
registration rights agreement with the former stockholders of
Mississippi Valley Gas Company that requires us, on no more than
two occasions, and with some limitations, to file a registration
statement under the Securities Act within 60 days of their
request for an offering designed to achieve a wide distribution
of shares through underwriters selected by us. We also granted
rights to these shareholders, subject to some limitations, to
participate in future registered offerings of our securities
until December 3, 2005. As of September 30, 2005,
1,193,143 shares were covered by the registration rights
agreement. Each of these shareholders has also agreed, for up to
five years from the closing of the acquisition, and with some
exceptions, not to sell or transfer shares representing more
than 1 percent of our total outstanding voting securities
to any person or group or any shares to a person or group who
would hold more than 9.9 percent of our total outstanding
voting securities after the sale or transfer. This restriction,
and other agreed restrictions on the ability of these
shareholders to acquire additional shares, participate in proxy
solicitations or act to seek control, may be deemed to have an
“anti-takeover” effect.

In addition, in connection with our funding of the Atmos Energy
Corporation Pension Account Plan, we issued, in June 2003, to
the Atmos Energy Corporation Master Retirement Trust, for the
benefit of the Pension Account Plan, 1,169,700 shares of
common stock under an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act. In the transaction, we entered into a
registration rights agreement with the asset manager of the
Pension Account Plan that requires us, on no more than three
occasions, and with some limitations, to file a registration
statement under the Securities Act within 60 days of its
request for an offering designed to achieve a wide distribution
of shares through underwriters selected by us. We also granted
rights to the asset manager, subject to some limitations, to
participate in future registered offerings of our securities.
The registration rights agreement expired on June 30, 2005.

Stock and Other Compensation Plans

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

We have two stock-based compensation plans that provide for the
granting of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options,
stock appreciation rights, bonus stock, restricted stock and
performance-based stock to officers and key employees: the 1998
Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Long-Term Stock Plan for



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the Mid-States Division. Nonemployee directors are also eligible
to receive such stock-based compensation under the 1998
Long-Term Incentive Plan. The objectives of these plans include
attracting and retaining the best personnel, providing for
additional performance incentives and promoting our success by
providing employees with the opportunity to acquire common stock.

1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan

On August 12, 1998, the Board of Directors approved and
adopted the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which became
effective October 1, 1998 after approval by our
shareholders. The Long-Term Incentive Plan is a comprehensive,
long-term incentive compensation plan providing for
discretionary awards of incentive stock options, non-qualified
stock options, stock appreciation rights, bonus stock,
restricted stock and performance-based stock to help attract,
retain and reward certain employees and non-employee directors
of Atmos and its subsidiaries. We are authorized to grant awards
for up to a maximum of 4.0 million shares of common stock
under this plan subject to certain adjustment provisions. As of
September 30, 2005, non-qualified stock options, bonus
stock and restricted stock have been issued under this plan, and
1,290,292 shares were available for issuance. The option
price of the stock options issued under this plan is equal to
the market price of our stock at the date of grant. These stock
options expire 10 years from the date of the grant and vest
annually over a service period ranging from one to three years.

Long-Term Stock Plan for the Mid-States Division

Prior to the merger with Atmos, certain United Cities Gas
Company officers and key employees participated in the United
Cities Long-Term Stock Plan implemented in 1989. At the time of
the merger on July 31, 1997, we adopted this plan by
registering a total of 250,000 shares of Atmos stock to be
issued under the Long-Term Stock Plan for the Mid-States
Division. Under this plan, incentive stock options, nonqualified
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or
any combination thereof may be granted to officers and key
employees of the Mid-States Division. Options granted under the
plan become exercisable at a rate of 20 percent per year
and expire 10 years after the date of grant. No awards have
been granted under this plan since 1996. During 2005, no options
were exercised under the plan. At September 30, 2005, there
were 300 options outstanding, all of which were fully
vested.

Restricted Stock Plans

As noted above, the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for
discretionary awards of restricted stock to help attract, retain
and reward employees and non-employee directors of Atmos and its
subsidiaries. Certain of these awards vest based upon the
passage of time and other awards vest based upon the passage of
time and the achievement of specified performance targets. The
associated expense is recognized ratably over the vesting
period. The following summarizes information regarding the
restricted stock plan:

Other Plans

Direct Stock Purchase Plan

We maintain a Direct Stock Purchase Plan which allows
participants to have all or part of their cash dividends paid
quarterly in additional shares of our common stock. Through
March 31, 2004, participants were permitted to reinvest
their cash dividends at a three percent discount from market
prices. Effective April 1, 2004, the three percent discount
on reinvested dividends was eliminated and the minimum initial
investment required to join the plan was increased to $1,250.
Direct Stock Purchase Plan participants may purchase additional
shares of Atmos common stock as often as weekly with voluntary
cash payments of at least $25, up to an annual maximum of
$100,000.



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Outside Directors Stock-For-Fee Plan

In November 1994, the Board adopted the Outside Directors
Stock-for-Fee Plan which was approved by the shareholders of
Atmos in February 1995 and was amended and restated in November
1997. The plan permits non-employee directors to receive all or
part of their annual retainer and meeting fees in stock rather
than in cash.

Equity Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plan for
    Non-Employee Directors

In November 1998, the Board of Directors adopted the Equity
Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
Directors which was approved by the shareholders of Atmos in
February 1999. This plan amended the Atmos Energy Corporation
Deferred Compensation Plan for Outside Directors adopted by the
Company on May 10, 1990 and replaced the pension payable
under the Company’s Retirement Plan for Non-Employee
Directors. The plan provides non-employee directors of Atmos
with the opportunity to defer receipt, until retirement, of
compensation for services rendered to the Company, invest
deferred compensation into either a cash account or a stock
account and to receive an annual grant of share units for each
year of service on the Board.

Variable Pay Plan

The Variable Pay Plan was created in fiscal 1999 to give each
employee an opportunity to share in the success of Atmos based
on the achievement of key performance measures considered
critical to achieving business objectives for a given year.
These performance measures may include earnings growth
objectives, improved cash flow objectives or crucial customer
satisfaction and safety results. We monitor progress towards the
achievement of the performance measures throughout the year and
record accruals based upon the expected payout using the best
estimates available at the time the accrual is recorded.

Retirement and Post-Retirement Employee Benefit Plans

We have both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit
plans that together cover substantially all of our employees. We
also maintain post-retirement plans that provide health care
benefits to retired employees. Finally, we sponsor defined
contribution plans which cover substantially all employees.
These plans are discussed in further detail below.

Defined Benefit Plans

Employee Pension Plans

As of September 30, 2005, we maintained two defined benefit
plans: the Atmos Energy Corporation Pension Account Plan and the
Atmos Energy Corporation Retirement Plan for Mississippi Valley
Gas Union Employees. Both plans are held within the Atmos Energy
Corporation Master Retirement Trust (the Master Trust).

The Atmos Energy Corporation Pension Account Plan (the Plan) was
established effective January 1, 1999 and covers
substantially all employees of Atmos. Opening account balances
were established for participants as of January 1, 1999
equal to the present value of their respective accrued benefits
under the pension plans which were previously in effect as of
December 31, 1998. The Plan credits an allocation to each
participant’s account at the end of each year according to
a formula based on the participant’s age, service and total
pay (excluding incentive pay). Although we did not assume the
existing employee benefit liabilities or plans of TXU Gas, we
agreed to give certain transitioned employees credit for years
of TXU Gas service under our pension plan.



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Plan also provides for an additional annual allocation based
upon a participant’s age as of January 1, 1999 for
those participants who were participants in the prior pension
plans. The Plan will credit this additional allocation each year
through December 31, 2008. In addition, at the end of each
year, a participant’s account will be credited with
interest on the employee’s prior year account balance. A
special grandfather benefit also applies through
December 31, 2008, for participants who were at least
age 50 as of January 1, 1999, and who were
participants in one of the prior plans on December 31,
1998. Participants fully vest in their account balances after
five years of service and may choose to receive their account
balances as a lump sum or an annuity.

MVG maintained a defined benefit plan that covered substantially
all full-time employees (the MVG Plan). On June 30, 2003,
all retirees and the active non-union employees became eligible
to participate in the Plan. Active union employees remained in
the MVG Plan, which was renamed the Atmos Energy Corporation
Retirement Plan for Mississippi Valley Gas Union Employees on
July 1, 2003. Under this plan, benefits are based upon
years of benefit service and average final earnings.
Participants vest in the plan after five years and will receive
their benefit in an annuity.

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an
amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. However, additional
voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered
necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for
benefits attributed to service to date but also for those
expected to be earned in the future.

During fiscal 2005, we voluntarily contributed $3.0 million
to the Master Trust to maintain the level of funding we desire
relative to our accumulated benefit obligation. We made the
contribution because declining high yield corporate bond yields
in the period leading up to our June 30, 2005 measurement
date resulted in an increase in the present value of our plan
liabilities. We did not contribute to our pension plans during
fiscal 2004. We are not required to make a minimum funding
contribution during fiscal 2006 nor do we anticipate making any
voluntary contributions during fiscal 2006.

We manage the Master Trust’s assets with the objective of
achieving a real rate of return of approximately four percent
per year. We make investment decisions and evaluate performance
on a medium term horizon of at least three to five years. We
also consider our current financial status when making
recommendations and decisions regarding the Master Trust’s
assets. Finally, we strive to ensure the Master Trust’s
assets are appropriately invested to maintain an acceptable
level of risk and meet the Master Trust’s long term asset
allocation policy.

To achieve these objectives, we invest the Master Trust’s
assets in equity securities, fixed income securities, interests
in commingled pension trust funds and cash and cash equivalents.
Investments in equity securities are diversified among the
market’s various subsectors to diversify risk and maximize
returns. Fixed income securities are invested in investment
grade securities. Cash equivalents are invested in securities
that either are short term (less than 180 days) or readily
convertible to cash with modest risk.

At September 30, 2005 and 2004, the Plan held
1,169,700 shares of Atmos common stock, which represented
9.1 percent and 9.0 percent of total Master Trust
assets. These shares generated dividend income of approximately
$1.5 million and $1.4 million during fiscal 2005 and
2004.

Our employee pension plan expenses and liabilities are
determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous
assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan
assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets and
assumed discount rates and demographic data. We review the
estimates and assumptions underlying our employee pension plans
annually based upon a June 30 measurement date. The
development of our assumptions is more fully described in our
significant accounting policies in Note 2. The actuarial
assumptions used to determine the pension liability for the
Master Trust were determined as of June 30, 2005 and 2004
and the actuarial assumptions used to determine the net periodic
pension cost for the Master Trust were determined as of

Postretirement Benefits

At September 30, 2005, we sponsored the Retiree Medical
Plan for Retirees and Disabled Employees of Atmos Energy
Corporation (the Atmos Retiree Medical Plan). Effective
December 31, 2004, the Atmos Energy Corporation Retiree
Welfare Benefits Plan for Certain MVG Non-Union Employees and
the Atmos Energy Corporation Retiree Welfare Benefits Plan for
MVG Union Employees merged into the Atmos Retiree Medical Plan.

This plan provides medical and prescription drug protection to
all qualified participants based on their date of retirement.
The Plan provides different levels of benefits depending on the
level of coverage chosen by the participants and the terms of
predecessor plans; however, we generally pay 80 percent of
the projected net claims and administrative costs and
participants pay the remaining 20 percent of this cost.

On October 1, 2004, in connection with the acquisition of
TXU Gas, we transitioned certain employees from TXU Gas to Atmos
Energy Corporation. Although we did not assume the existing
employee benefit liabilities or plans of TXU Gas, we received a
credit of $18.9 million against the purchase price to
permit us to provide partial past service credits for retiree
medical benefits under the Atmos Retiree Medical Plan. The
$18.9 million credit approximated the actuarially
determined present value of the accumulated benefits related to
the past service of the transitioned employees on the
acquisition date.

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an
amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. However, additional
voluntary contributions are made annually as considered
necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for
benefits attributed

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in
the future. We expect to contribute $11.9 million to our
postretirement benefits plans during fiscal 2006.

We maintain a formal investment policy with respect to the
assets in our postretirement benefits plans in order to ensure
the assets funding the postretirement benefit plans are
appropriately invested to maintain an acceptable level of risk.
We also consider our current financial status when making
recommendations and decisions regarding the postretirement
benefits plans.

We currently invest the assets funding our postretirement
benefit plans in money market funds, equity mutual funds, fixed
income funds and a balanced fund. The following table presents

benefit plans: the Atmos Energy Corporation Retirement Savings
Plan and Trust (the Retirement Savings Plan) and the Atmos
Energy Corporation Savings Plan for MVG Union Employees (the
Union 401K Plan).

The Retirement Savings Plan covers substantially all employees
and is subject to the provisions of Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Participants may elect a salary reduction
ranging from a minimum of one percent up to a maximum of
65 percent of eligible compensation, as defined by the
Plan, not to exceed the maximum allowed by the Internal Revenue
Service. We match 100 percent of a participant’s
contributions, limited to four percent of the participant’s
salary, in Atmos common stock. Participants are eligible to
receive matching contributions after completing one year of
service. However, participants have the option to immediately
transfer this matching contribution into other funds held within
the plan. Participants are also permitted to take out loans
against their accounts subject to certain restrictions.

The Union 401K Plan covers substantially all Mississippi
Division employees who are members of the International Chemical
Workers Union Council, United Food and Commercial Workers Union
International and is subject to the provisions of
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees of
the Union automatically become participants of the Union 401K
plan on the date of union employment. We match

50 percent of a participant’s contribution, limited to
six percent of the participant’s eligible contribution.
Participants are also permitted to take out loans against their

Matching contributions to our defined contribution plans are
expensed as incurred and amounted to $5.7 million,
$4.6 million, and $4.1 million for 2005, 2004 and
2003. The Board of Directors may also approve discretionary
contributions, subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 and applicable regulations of the Internal Revenue
Service. No discretionary contributions were made for 2005, 2004
or 2003. At September 30, 2005 and 2004, the Retirement

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Litigation

, which was remanded to the same court in
January 2001. The plaintiffs in these two lawsuits that have now
been consolidated, who purport to represent a class of royalty
owners, allege that the defendants have underpaid royalties on
gas taken from wells situated on non-federal and non-Indian
lands in Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming, predicated upon
allegations that the defendants’ gas measurements are
inaccurate. The plaintiffs have not specifically alleged an
amount of damages. The District Court denied an earlier motion
in these proceedings to certify a class but gave plaintiffs
permission to try to seek certification of a revised class,
which we intend to oppose. We believe that the plaintiffs’
claims are lacking in merit, and we intend to vigorously defend
this action. While the results of this litigation cannot be
predicted with certainty, we believe the final outcome of such
litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations, or net cash flows.

West Texas Division

We were the plaintiff in a case styled

Energas Company, a

filed in December 2001, in the

Judicial
District in the District Court of Lubbock County, Texas. This
case was filed to recover damages resulting from various claims
involving the sale, measurement, transportation and balancing of
natural gas. This case and all related claims have been settled.
The settlement did not have a material effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or net cash flows.

United Cities Propane Gas, Inc.

United Cities Propane Gas, Inc., one of our wholly-owned
subsidiaries, is a party to an action filed in June 2000 that is
pending in the Circuit Court of Sevier County, Tennessee. The
plaintiffs’ claims arise out of injuries alleged to have
been caused by a low-level propane explosion. The plaintiffs
seek to recover damages of $13.0 million. Discovery
activities continue in this case. We have denied any liability,
and we intend to vigorously defend against the plaintiffs’
claims. This case has been set for trial in December 2005. While
the results of this litigation cannot be predicted with
certainty, we believe the final outcome of such litigation will
not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or net cash flows.

We are a party to other litigation and claims that arose in the
ordinary course of our business, including certain litigation
and claims that arose in the ordinary course of the business of
TXU Gas Company, the natural gas distribution and pipeline
operations we acquired on October 1, 2004. While the
results of such litigation and claims cannot be predicted with
certainty, we believe the final outcome of such litigation and
claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or net cash flows.

Environmental Matters

Manufactured Gas Plant Sites

We are the owner or previous owner of manufactured gas plant
sites in Johnson City and Bristol, Tennessee, and Hannibal,
Missouri, which were used to supply gas prior to the
availability of natural gas. The gas manufacturing process
resulted in certain byproducts and residual materials, including
coal tar. The manufacturing process used by our predecessors was
an acceptable and satisfactory process at the time such
operations were being conducted. Under current environmental
protection laws and regulations, we may be responsible for
response actions with respect to such materials if response
actions are necessary.

United Cities Gas Company and the Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation (TDEC) entered into a consent
order effective January 23, 1997, to facilitate the
investigation, removal and remediation of the Johnson City site.
Prior to our merger with United Cities Gas Company in July 1997,

completed a risk assessment report that has been approved by the
TDEC as well as a feasibility study for this site, which was
submitted to the TDEC in October 2003. The feasibility study
recommends a remedial action that will limit the use of and
access to the impacted soil, cap the site with the addition of a
clay fill and geosynthetic liner, and groundwater monitoring for
a period of up to 30 years. The feasibility study was
approved by the TDEC in February 2005 and we are awaiting a
Record of Decision from the TDEC. The estimated cost of the
proposed remedial action is $1.5 million, which is
comprised primarily of operating and maintenance costs that
would be associated with a groundwater monitoring project. The
Tennessee Regulatory Authority granted us permission to defer,
until our next rate case in Tennessee, all costs incurred in
Tennessee in connection with state and federally mandated
environmental control requirements.

In March 2002, the TDEC contacted us about conducting an
investigation at a former manufactured gas plant located in
Bristol, Tennessee. We agreed to perform a preliminary
investigation at the site, which we completed in June 2002. The
investigation identified manufactured gas plant residual
materials in the soil beneath the site, and we have proposed
performing a focused removal action to remove any such
residuals. The TDEC requested that the focused removal action be
conducted pursuant to a voluntary agreement. On April 13,
2004, we entered into a voluntary consent agreement with the
TDEC for the performance of the removal action and the removal
action was completed in November 2004. In September 2005, we
filed site use limitations on the property in the local property
records, including restrictions on the use of the site to
commercial and industrial purposes and a prohibition of the use
of ground water for use as drinking water were filed.

On July 22, 1998, we entered into an Abatement Order on
Consent with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources to
address the former manufactured gas plant located in Hannibal,
Missouri. We agreed to perform a removal action and a subsequent
site evaluation and to reimburse the response costs incurred by
the state of Missouri in connection with the property. The
removal action was conducted and completed in August 1998, and
the site-evaluation field work was conducted in August 1999. A
risk assessment for the site has been approved by the Missouri
Department of Natural Resources. In preparation for the risk
assessment, we executed and recorded certain site-use
limitations, including restricting use of the site to commercial
and industrial purposes and prohibiting the withdrawal of
groundwater for use as drinking water. In addition, we have
installed a geosynthetic liner over the surface of the site.

In 1995, United Cities Gas Company entered into an agreement
with a third party to resolve its share of the costs of
additional investigations and environmental-response actions for
soil contamination at a former manufactured gas plant in Keokuk,
Iowa. However, the extent of groundwater contamination at the
site, if any, which is not covered by the agreement, has yet to
be determined.

As of September 30, 2005, we had incurred costs of
approximately $2.2 million for the investigations of the
Johnson City and Bristol, Tennessee, and Hannibal, Missouri
sites.

We are a party to other environmental matters and claims that
have arisen in the ordinary course of our business. While the
ultimate results of response actions to these environmental
matters and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we
believe the final outcome of such response actions will not have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations or net cash flows because we believe that the
expenditures related to such response actions will either be
recovered through rates, shared with other parties or are
adequately covered by insurance.

Purchase Commitments

AEM has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural
gas under contracts indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed
price contracts. At September 30, 2005, AEM was committed
to purchase 32.3 Bcf within one year, 29.2 Bcf
within one to three years and 9.9 Bcf after three years
under indexed contracts. AEM is committed to
purchase 1.3 Bcf within one year and 0.4 Bcf
within one to three years under fixed price contracts with
prices ranging from $5.24 to $17.50. Purchases under these
contracts totaled $1,421.2 million, $1,252.2 million
and $1,454.8 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Our utility divisions, except for our Mid-Tex Division, maintain
supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a
period of up to one year. Commitments for estimated base gas
volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis
at contractually negotiated prices. Commitments for incremental
daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in
accordance with the terms of the individual contract.

Our Mid-Tex Division maintains long-term supply contracts to
ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service
area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market
prices. The estimated commitments under these contracts as of
September 30, 2005 are as follows (in thousands):

In January 2005, we signed a letter of intent with a third party
to jointly construct, own and operate a 45-mile large diameter
natural gas pipeline in the northern portion of the Dallas/
Fort Worth Metroplex. Under terms of the letter of intent,
the third party will provide the initial capital to build the
pipeline and we expect to contribute $45.0 million within
two years of signing of a definitive agreement. We expect to
execute this agreement during the first quarter of fiscal 2006
and the pipeline is currently expected to be placed into service
in fiscal 2006.

During the third quarter of 2005, we entered into two agreements
with third parties to transport natural gas through our Texas
intrastate pipeline system beginning in fiscal 2006. To handle
the increased volumes for these projects, we will install
compression equipment and other pipeline infrastructure. We
expect to spend approximately $32.0 million in 2006 for
these projects.

On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf
Coast, inflicting significant damage in our eastern Louisiana
operations. The hardest hit areas in our service area were in
Jefferson, St. Tammany, St. Bernard and Plaquemines
parishes. In total, approximately 230,000 of our natural gas
customers were affected in these areas. A significant number of
these customers will not require gas service for some time
because of sustained damages. We cannot predict with certainty
how many of these customers will return to these service areas
and over what time period. Additionally, we cannot accurately
determine what regulatory actions, if any, may be taken by the
regulators with respect to these areas. Finally, although we
believe our insurance will cover all losses in excess of our
deductible, it is possible that certain of these losses may not
be fully recoverable.

Leases

Leasing Operations

Atmos Power Systems, Inc. constructs electric peaking power
generating plants and associated facilities and enters into
agreements to either lease or sell these plants. We completed a
sales-type lease transaction for one distributed electric
generation plant in 2001 and a second sales-type lease
transaction in 2003. In 2001, we recognized a gain of
$0.8 million and deferred $4.7 million of income,
which will be recognized using the interest method through
August 2011. In 2003, we recognized a gain of $3.9 million
and deferred $8.6 million in income, which will be
recognized using the interest method through September 2012. As
of September 30, 2005 and 2004, we recorded receivables of
$22.4 million and $25.5 million and recorded income of
$1.6 million, $1.9 million and $2.0 million for

terms range from one to 20 years and generally provide for
the payment of taxes, insurance and maintenance by the lessee.
Renewal options exist for certain of these leases. We have also
entered into capital leases for division offices and operating
facilities. Property, plant and equipment included amounts for
capital leases of $5.8 million at both September 30,
2005 and 2004. Accumulated depreciation for these capital leases
totaled $3.8 million and $2.4 million at
September 30, 2005 and 2004. Depreciation expense for these
assets is included in consolidated depreciation expense on the
consolidated statement of income.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to us if a customer
fails to perform its contractual obligations. We engage in
transactions for the purchase and sale of products and services
with major companies in the energy industry and with industrial,
commercial, residential and municipal energy consumers. These
transactions principally occur in the southern and midwestern
regions of the United States. We believe that this geographic
concentration does not contribute significantly to our overall
exposure to credit risk. Credit risk associated with trade
accounts receivable for the utility segment is mitigated by the
large number of individual customers and diversity in customer
base. Due to minimal receivables, the credit risk for our other
nonutility segment is not significant.

The diversification in AEM’s customers helps mitigate its
credit exposure. AEM maintains credit policies with respect to
its counterparties that it believes minimizes overall credit
risk. Where appropriate, such policies include the evaluation of
a prospective counterparty’s financial condition,
collateral requirements and the use of standardized agreements
that facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a
single counterparty. AEM also monitors the financial condition
of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis. Customers not
meeting minimum standards are required to provide adequate
assurance of financial performance.

AEM maintains an allowance for credit losses based upon factors
surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends and
other information. We believe, based on our credit policies and
our allowance for credit losses, that our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows will not be materially
affected as a result of counterparty nonperformance.

AEM’s estimated credit exposure is monitored in terms of
the percentage of its customers that are rated as investment
grade versus non-investment grade. Credit exposure is defined as
the total of (1) accounts receivable, (2) delivered,
but unbilled physical sales and (3) mark-to-market exposure
for sales and purchases. Investment grade determinations are set
internally by the credit department, but are primarily based on
external ratings provided by Moody’s Investor Service
and/or Standard & Poor’s Rating Service. For
non-rated entities, the default rating for municipalities is
investment grade, while the default rating for non-

guaranteed industrials and commercials is non-investment grade.

The following table presents our derivative counterparty credit

minimum credit ratings of BBB-, assigned by Standard &
Poor’s Rating Group; or Baa3, assigned by Moody’s
Investor Service. Non-investment grade counterparties are
composed of counterparties that are below investment grade or
that have not been assigned an internal investment grade rating
due to the short-term nature of the contracts associated with
that counterparty. This category is composed of numerous smaller
counterparties, none of which is individually significant.

nonutility businesses. We distribute natural gas through sales
and transportation arrangements to approximately
3.2 million residential, commercial, public-authority and
industrial customers through our seven regulated utility
divisions, which covered service areas located in
12 states. In addition, we transport natural gas for others
through our distribution system.

Through our nonutility businesses, we provide natural gas
management and marketing services to industrial customers,
municipalities and other local distribution companies located in
22 states.



ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

Our operations are divided into four segments:

Effective October 1, 2004, we created the pipeline and
storage segment which includes the regulated pipeline and
storage operations of Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division
and the nonregulated pipeline and storage operations of Atmos
Pipeline and Storage, LLC, which was previously included in our
other nonutility segment. Segment information for all prior year
periods has been restated to reflect our new organizational
structure.

Our determination of reportable segments considers the strategic
operating units under which we manage sales of various products
and services to customers in differing regulatory environments.
Although our utility segment operations are geographically
dispersed, they are reported as a single segment as each utility
division has similar economic characteristics. The accounting
policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies. We evaluate
performance based on net income or loss of the respective
operating units. Interest expense is allocated pro rata to each
segment based upon our net investment in each segment. Income
taxes are allocated to each segment as if each segment’s
taxes were calculated on a separate return basis.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors

Atmos Energy Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting, that Atmos Energy Corporation maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
September 30, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the COSO criteria). Atmos Energy Corporation’s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Atmos Energy
Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2005, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our
opinion, Atmos Energy Corporation maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of September 30, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Atmos Energy Corporation as of
September 30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
September 30, 2005 of Atmos Energy Corporation and our
report dated November 16, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.
