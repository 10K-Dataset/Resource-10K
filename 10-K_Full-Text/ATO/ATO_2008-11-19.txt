ITEM 1.

Business.

Overview
    and Strategy

Atmos Energy Corporation, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is
    engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and
    transmission and storage businesses as well as other
    nonregulated natural gas businesses. Since our incorporation in
    Texas in 1983, we have grown primarily through a series of
    acquisitions, the most recent of which was the acquisition in
    October 2004 of the natural gas distribution and pipeline
    operations of TXU Gas Company. We are also incorporated in the
    state of Virginia.

Today, we distribute natural gas through regulated sales and
    transportation arrangements to approximately 3.2 million
    residential, commercial, public authority and industrial
    customers in 12 states located primarily in the South,
    which makes us one of the country’s largest
    natural-gas-only distributors based on number of customers. We
    also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in Texas
    based on miles of pipe.

Through our nonregulated businesses, we primarily provide
    natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities,
    other local gas distribution companies and industrial customers
    primarily in the Midwest and Southeast and natural gas
    transportation along with storage services to certain of our
    natural gas distribution divisions and third parties.

Our overall strategy is to:

•

deliver superior shareholder value,

•

improve the quality and consistency of earnings growth, while
    operating our regulated and nonregulated businesses
    exceptionally well and

•

enhance and strengthen a culture built on our core values.

We have experienced more than 20 consecutive years of increasing
    dividends and earnings growth after giving effect to our
    acquisitions. Historically, we achieved this record of growth
    through acquisitions while efficiently managing our operating
    and maintenance expenses and leveraging our technology, such as
    our

24-hour

call centers, to achieve more efficient operations. In recent
    years, we have also achieved growth by implementing rate designs
    that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the
    recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns.
    In addition, we have developed various commercial opportunities
    within our regulated transmission and storage operations.
    Finally, we have strengthened our nonregulated businesses by
    increasing sales volumes and actively pursuing opportunities to
    increase the amount of storage available to us.

Our core values include focusing on our employees and customers
    while conducting our business with honesty and integrity. We
    continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing
    communications with our employees and enhanced employee training.

Operating
    Segments

We operate the Company through the following four segments:

•

The

natural gas distribution segment

, which includes our
    regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations.

•

The

regulated transmission and storage segment

, which
    includes the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our
    Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division.

•

The

natural gas marketing segment

, which includes a
    variety of nonregulated natural gas management services.



•

The

pipeline, storage and other segment

, which is
    comprised of our nonregulated natural gas transmission and
    storage services.

These operating segments are described in greater detail below.

Natural
    Gas Distribution Segment Overview

Our natural gas distribution segment consists of the following
    six regulated divisions, in order of total customers served,
    covering service areas in 12 states:

•

Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division,

•

Atmos Energy Kentucky/Mid-States Division,

•

Atmos Energy Louisiana Division,

•

Atmos Energy West Texas Division,

•

Atmos Energy Mississippi Division and

•

Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division

Our natural gas distribution business is a seasonal business.
    Gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater
    during the winter months than during the remainder of the year.
    The volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with
    the temperatures during these months.

Revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory
    authorities in the states in which we operate. These rates are
    intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting
    business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital.
    Our primary service areas are located in Colorado, Kansas,
    Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. We have
    more limited service areas in Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri
    and Virginia. In addition, we transport natural gas for others
    through our distribution system.

Rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost
    adjustment mechanisms that (i) are subject to significant
    price fluctuations compared to our other costs,
    (ii) represent a large component of our cost of service and
    (iii) are generally outside our control.

Purchased gas mechanisms represent a common form of cost
    adjustment mechanism. Purchased gas adjustment mechanisms
    provide natural gas utility companies a method of recovering
    purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate
    case because they provide a dollar-for-dollar offset to
    increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas costs.
    Therefore, although substantially all of our natural gas
    distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas
    that we purchase, natural gas distribution gross profit (which
    is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost) is
    generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas.

Additionally, some jurisdictions have introduced
    performance-based ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives
    to natural gas utilities to minimize purchased gas costs through
    improved storage management and use of financial instruments to
    lock in gas costs. Under the performance-based ratemaking
    adjustment, purchased gas costs savings are shared between the
    utility and its customers.

Finally, regulatory authorities for over 90 percent of
    residential and commercial meters in our service areas have
    approved weather normalization adjustments (WNA) as a part of
    our rates. WNA minimizes the effect of weather that is above or
    below normal by allowing us to increase customers’ bills to
    offset lower gas usage when weather is warmer than normal and
    decrease customers’ bills to offset higher gas usage when
    weather is colder than normal.



As of September 30, 2008 we had WNA for our residential and
    commercial meters in the following service areas for the
    following periods:

Georgia

October — May

Kansas

October — May

Kentucky

November — April

Louisiana

December — March

Mississippi

November — April

Tennessee

November — April

Texas: Mid-Tex

November — April

Texas: West Texas

October — May

Virginia

January — December

In addition to seasonality, financial results for this segment
    are affected by the cost of natural gas and economic conditions
    in the areas that we serve. Higher gas costs, which we are
    generally able to pass through to our customers under purchased
    gas adjustment clauses, may cause customers to conserve or, in
    the case of industrial customers, to use alternative energy
    sources. Higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts
    receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense and
    may require us to increase borrowings under our credit
    facilities resulting in higher interest expense.

Our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers,
    including independent producers, marketers and pipeline
    companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted
    storage assets. Additionally, the natural gas supply for our
    Mid-Tex Division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements.

Supply arrangements are contracted from our suppliers on a firm
    basis with various terms at market prices. The firm supply
    consists of both base load and swing supply (peaking)
    quantities. Base load quantities are those that flow at a
    constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities
    provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match
    increases or decreases in requirements related to weather
    conditions.

Currently, all of our natural gas distribution divisions, except
    for our Mid-Tex Division, utilize 37 pipeline transportation
    companies, both interstate and intrastate, to transport our
    natural gas. The pipeline transportation agreements are firm and
    many of them have “pipeline no-notice” storage
    service, which provides for daily balancing between system
    requirements and nominated flowing supplies. These agreements
    have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while
    still maintaining our right of first refusal. The natural gas
    supply for our Mid-Tex Division is delivered by our Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division.

Except for local production purchases, we select our natural gas
    suppliers through a competitive bidding process by requesting
    proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can
    provide reliable service. We select these suppliers based on
    their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm
    pipeline receipt points at the lowest cost. Major suppliers
    during fiscal 2008 were Anadarko Energy Services, BP Energy
    Company, Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc., ConocoPhillips
    Company, Devon Gas Services, L.P., Enbridge Marketing (US) L.P.,
    National Fuel Marketing Company, LLC, ONEOK Energy Services
    Company L.P., Tenaska Marketing and Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC,
    our natural gas marketing subsidiary.

The combination of base load, peaking and spot purchase
    agreements, coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage,
    allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather, which
    minimizes our need to enter into long-term firm commitments. We
    estimate our

peak-day

availability of natural gas supply to be approximately
    4.2 Bcf. The

peak-day

demand for our natural gas distribution operations in fiscal
    2008 was on January 2, 2008, when sales to customers
    reached approximately 3.1 Bcf.

To maintain our deliveries to high priority customers, we have
    the ability, and have exercised our right, to curtail deliveries
    to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts
    or applicable state statutes or regulations. Our customers’
    demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our
    ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or
    immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the
    physical limitations of gathering, storage and transmission
    systems, the duration and severity of cold weather, the
    availability of gas reserves from our suppliers, the ability to
    purchase additional supplies on a short-term basis



and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities.
    Curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the
    human-needs requirements of our customers on a firm basis.
    Priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory
    agencies, as well as other factors beyond our control, may
    affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers. We
    anticipate no problems with obtaining additional gas supply as
    needed for our customers.

The following briefly describes our six natural gas distribution
    divisions. We operate in our service areas under terms of
    non-exclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities
    and towns that we serve. At September 30, 2008, we held
    1,107 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to
    35 years. A significant number of our franchises expire
    each year, which require renewal prior to the end of their
    terms. We believe that we will be able to renew our franchises
    as they expire. Additional information concerning our natural
    gas distribution divisions is presented under the caption
    “Operating Statistics”.

Atmos Energy Mid-Tex Division.

Our Mid-Tex
    Division serves approximately 550 incorporated and
    unincorporated communities in the north-central, eastern and
    western parts of Texas, including the Dallas/Fort Worth
    Metroplex. The governing body of each municipality we serve has
    original jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates,
    operations and services within its city limits, except with
    respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel and
    agricultural use. The Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) has
    exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory
    orders and ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive
    original jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not
    located within the limits of a municipality.

Prior to fiscal 2008, this division operated under one
    system-wide rate structure. However, beginning in 2008, we
    reached a settlement with cities representing approximately
    80 percent of this division’s customers (Settled
    Cities) that will allow us to update rates for customers in
    these cities through an annual rate review mechanism. Rates for
    the remaining 20 percent of this division’s customers,
    including the City of Dallas, continue to be updated through
    periodic formal rate proceedings and filings made under
    Texas’ Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program (GRIP). GRIP
    allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital
    costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file
    a complete rate case at least once every five years.

Atmos Energy Kentucky/Mid-States Division.

Our
    Kentucky/Mid-States Division operates in more than 420
    communities across Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri,
    Tennessee and Virginia. The service areas in these states are
    primarily rural; however, this division serves Franklin,
    Tennessee, and other suburban areas of Nashville. We update our
    rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings made
    with each state’s public service commission.

Atmos Energy Louisiana Division.

In Louisiana,
    we serve nearly 300 communities, including the suburban areas of
    New Orleans, the metropolitan area of Monroe and western
    Louisiana. Direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers
    in Louisiana, who use gas for fuel or in manufacturing
    processes, and sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel are exempt
    from regulation and are recognized in our natural gas marketing
    segment. Our rates in this division are updated annually through
    a stable rate filing without filing a formal rate case.

Atmos Energy West Texas Division.

Our West
    Texas Division serves approximately 80 communities in West
    Texas, including the Amarillo, Lubbock and Midland areas. Like
    our Mid-Tex Division, each municipality we serve has original
    jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates, operations and
    services within its city limits, with the RRC having exclusive
    appellate jurisdiction over the municipalities and exclusive
    original jurisdiction over rates and services provided to
    customers not located within the limits of a municipality. Prior
    to fiscal 2008, rates were updated in this division through
    formal rate proceedings. However, during 2008, the West Texas
    Division entered into agreements with its Lubbock and West Texas
    service areas to update rates for customers in these service
    areas through an annual rate review mechanism. Rates for the
    division’s Amarillo service area continue to be updated
    through periodic formal rate proceedings and filings made under
    GRIP.

Atmos Energy Mississippi Division.

In
    Mississippi, we serve about 110 communities throughout the
    northern half of the state, including the Jackson metropolitan
    area. Our rates in the Mississippi Division are updated annually
    through a stable rate filing without filing a formal rate case.



Atmos Energy Colorado-Kansas Division.

Our
    Colorado-Kansas Division serves approximately 170 communities
    throughout Colorado and Kansas and parts of Missouri, including
    the cities of Olathe, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City and
    Greeley, Colorado, a suburb of Denver. We update our rates in
    this division through periodic formal rate filings made with
    each state’s public service commission.

Regulated
    Transmission and Storage Segment Overview

Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the
    regulated pipeline and storage operations of our Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division. This division transports
    natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division, transports natural gas for
    third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in
    Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary in the
    pipeline industry including parking arrangements, lending and
    sales of inventory on hand. Parking arrangements provide
    short-term interruptible storage of gas on our pipeline. Lending
    services provide short-term interruptible loans of natural gas
    from our pipeline to meet market demands. These operations
    represent one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in
    Texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural
    gas-producing areas of central, northern and eastern Texas,
    extending into or near the major producing areas of the Texas
    Gulf Coast and the Delaware and Val Verde Basins of West Texas.
    Nine basins located in Texas are believed to contain a
    substantial portion of the nation’s remaining onshore
    natural gas reserves. This pipeline system provides access to
    all of these basins. Gross profit earned from our Mid-Tex
    Division and through certain other transportation and storage
    services is subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the
    RRC. However, Atmos Pipeline — Texas’ existing
    regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage
    services to be provided under market-based rates with minimal
    regulation.

Natural
    Gas Marketing Segment Overview

Our natural gas marketing activities are conducted through Atmos
    Energy Marketing (AEM), which is wholly-owned by Atmos Energy
    Holdings, Inc. (AEH). AEH is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEC
    and operates primarily in the Midwest and Southeast areas of the
    United States. AEM aggregates and purchases gas supply, arranges
    transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas
    to customers at competitive prices. To facilitate this process,
    we utilize proprietary and customer-owned transportation and
    storage assets to provide various services our customers
    request, including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and
    market-based prices, contract negotiation and administration,
    load forecasting, gas storage acquisition and management
    services, transportation services, peaking sales and balancing
    services, capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging
    through the use of financial instruments. As a result, our
    revenues arise from the types of commercial transactions we have
    structured with our customers and include the value we extract
    by optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or
    control as well as revenues for services we deliver.

Our asset optimization activities seek to maximize the economic
    value associated with the storage and transportation capacity we
    own or control. We attempt to meet this objective by engaging in
    natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and
    profit from the pricing differences that occur over time. We



purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial
    instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit
    margin. We also seek to participate in transactions in which we
    combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to
    minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers by
    identifying the lowest cost alternative within the natural gas
    supplies, transportation and markets to which we have access.
    Through the use of transportation and storage services and
    financial instruments, we are able to capture gross profit
    margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various
    locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over
    time.

AEM’s management of natural gas requirements involves the
    sale of natural gas and the management of storage and
    transportation supplies under contracts with customers generally
    having one to two year terms. AEM also sells natural gas to some
    of its industrial customers on a delivered burner tip basis
    under contract terms ranging from 30 days to two years.

Pipeline,
    Storage and Other Segment Overview

Our pipeline, storage and other segment primarily consists of
    the operations of Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC (APS), Atmos
    Energy Services, LLC (AES) and Atmos Power Systems, Inc., which
    are each wholly-owned by AEH.

APS owns and operates a 21 mile pipeline located in New
    Orleans, Louisiana. This pipeline is primarily used to aggregate
    gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division
    in Louisiana and for AEM. However, it also provides limited
    third party transportation services. APS also owns or has an
    interest in underground storage fields in Kentucky and
    Louisiana. We use these storage facilities to reduce the need to
    contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer
    demand during peak periods. Finally, beginning in fiscal 2006,
    APS initiated activities in the natural gas gathering business.
    As of September 30, 2008, these activities were limited in
    nature.

APS also engages in limited asset optimization activities
    whereby it seeks to maximize the economic value associated with
    the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls.
    Most of these arrangements are with regulated affiliates of the
    Company and have been approved by applicable state regulatory
    commissions. Generally, these arrangements require APS to share
    with our regulated customers a portion of the profits earned
    from these arrangements.

AES, through December 31, 2006, provided natural gas
    management services to our natural gas distribution operations,
    other than the Mid-Tex Division. These services included
    aggregating and purchasing gas supply, arranging transportation
    and storage logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our
    natural gas distribution service areas at competitive prices.
    Effective January 1, 2007, our shared services function
    began



providing these services to our natural gas distribution
    operations. AES continues to provide limited services to our
    natural gas distribution divisions, and the revenues AES
    receives are equal to the costs incurred to provide those
    services.

Through Atmos Power Systems, Inc., we have constructed electric
    peaking power-generating plants and associated facilities and
    lease these plants through lease agreements that are accounted
    for as sales under generally accepted accounting principles.

Ratemaking
    Activity

Overview

The method of determining regulated rates varies among the
    states in which our natural gas distribution divisions operate.
    The regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring
    that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best
    interests of customers while providing utility companies the
    opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment.
    Generally, each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and
    establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue
    sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to
    provide a reasonable return on invested capital.

Our current rate strategy is to focus on reducing or eliminating
    regulatory lag, obtaining adequate returns and providing stable,
    predictable margins. Atmos Energy has annual ratemaking
    mechanisms in place in three states that provide for an annual
    rate review and adjustment to rates for approximately
    65 percent of our customers. Additionally, we have WNA
    mechanisms in eight states. These mechanisms work in tandem to
    provide insulation from volatile margins, both for the Company
    and our customers.

We will also continue to address various rate design changes,
    including the recovery of bad debt gas costs, inclusion of other
    taxes in gas costs and stratification of rates to benefit low
    income households in future rate filings. These design changes
    would address cost variations that are related to pass-through
    energy costs beyond our control.

Improving rate design is a long-term process. In the interim, we
    are addressing regulatory lag issues by directing discretionary
    capital spending to jurisdictions where recovery rules minimize
    the regulatory lag, which helps us to keep actual returns more
    closely aligned with allowed returns.



Recent
    Ratemaking Activity

Approximately 97 percent of our natural gas distribution
    revenues in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008, 2007
    and 2006 were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to
    approval by local or state authorities. Net annual revenue
    increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling
    $34.5 million, $40.1 million, and $39.0 million
    became effective in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 as summarized
    below:

Our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail

Rate
    Case Filings

A rate case is a formal request from Atmos Energy to a
    regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to
    customers. Rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory
    authorities request us to justify our rates. This process is
    referred to as a “show cause” action. Adequate rates

a cost allocation method that eliminated a subsidy received from
    industrial and transportation customers and increased the
    revenue responsibility for residential and commercial customers.
    However, the order also required an immediate refund of amounts
    collected from our 2003 — 2005 GRIP filings of
    approximately $2.9 million and reduced our total return to
    7.903 percent from 8.258 percent, based on a capital
    structure of 48.1 percent equity and 51.9 percent debt
    with a return on equity of 10 percent.

The Missouri Commission issued an order in March 2007 approving
    a settlement with rate design changes, including revenue
    decoupling through the recovery of all non-gas cost revenues
    through fixed monthly charges and no rate increase.

Annual
    Rate Filing Mechanisms

As an instrument to reduce regulatory lag, annual rate filing
    mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on a periodic basis
    without filing a formal rate case. However, these filings still
    involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities
    prior to the final determination of rates under these
    mechanisms. As discussed above in “Natural Gas Distribution
    Segment Overview,” we currently have annual rate filing
    mechanisms in our Louisiana and Mississippi divisions and in
    significant portions of our Mid-Tex and West Texas divisions.
    These mechanisms are referred to as rate review mechanisms in
    our Mid-Tex and West Texas



Divisions and stable rate filings in our Louisiana and
    Mississippi divisions. The following table summarizes filings

The rate review mechanism in the Mid-Tex Division was entered
    into as a result of a settlement in the September 20, 2007
    Statement of Intent case filed with all Mid-Tex Division cities.
    Of the 439 incorporated cities served by the Mid-Tex Division,
    438 of these cities are part of the rate review mechanism
    process. The West Texas rate review mechanism was entered into
    in August 2008 as a result of a settlement with the West Texas
    Coalition of Cities. The Lubbock Customer Conservation Value
    Plan (CCVP) was entered into in May 2008 as a result of a
    settlement to resolve ongoing rate issues. All three mechanisms
    have been implemented under a three year trial basis, beginning
    in fiscal 2009, based upon calendar 2007 financial information.

In the state of Kansas, ad valorem tax represents a general tax
    on all real and personal property determined based on the value
    of the property. This tax is assessed to the Company and
    recovered from our customers through our rates.

In November 2007, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission
    approved an earnings agreement entered into jointly between the
    Colorado-Kansas Division, the Commission Staff and the Office of
    Consumer Counsel. The agreement called for a one-time refund to
    customers of $1.1 million made in January 2008.

In addition to the activity above, in December 2006, the
    Louisiana Public Service Commission issued a staff report
    allowing the deferral of $4.3 million in operating and
    maintenance expenses in our Louisiana Division to allow recovery
    of all incremental operation and maintenance expense incurred in
    fiscal 2005 and 2006 in connection with our Hurricane Katrina
    recovery efforts.

In September 2006, our Mid-Tex Division filed its annual gas
    cost reconciliation with the RRC. The filing reflects
    approximately $24 million in refunds of amounts that were
    overcollected from customers between July 2005 and June 2006.
    The Mid-Tex Division received approval to refund these amounts
    over a six-month period, which began in November 2006. The
    ruling had no impact on the gross profit for the Mid-Tex
    Division.

In May 2007, our Mid-Tex Division filed a

36-month

gas
    contract review filing. This filing is mandated by prior RRC
    orders and relates to the prudency of gas purchases made from
    November 2003 through October 2006, which total approximately
    $2.7 billion. An

agreed-upon

procedural schedule was filed with the RRC, which established a
    hearing schedule beginning in December 2007. In July 2008, the
    City of Dallas filed testimony recommending a disallowance of
    approximately $58 million and the ACSC Coalition of Cities
    filed testimony recommending a disallowance of approximately
    $89 million. However, the Mid-Tex Division has historically
    been able to settle similar gas contract reviews for
    significantly less than the requested disallowance amounts. A
    hearing was held at the RRC in September 2008, and initial and
    reply briefs were filed by all parties in mid-October 2008. A
    proposal for decision on this matter is expected by the end of
    March 2009.

Other
    Regulation

Each of our natural gas distribution divisions is regulated by
    various state or local public utility authorities. We are also
    subject to regulation by the United States Department of
    Transportation with respect to safety requirements in the
    operation and maintenance of our gas distribution facilities. In
    addition, our distribution operations are also subject to
    various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters.
    From time to time we receive inquiries regarding various
    environmental matters. We believe that our properties and
    operations substantially comply with and are operated in
    substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental
    statutes and regulations. There are no administrative or
    judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality
    statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental
    agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our
    operations. Our environmental claims have arisen primarily from
    former manufactured gas plant sites in Tennessee, Iowa and
    Missouri.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allows, pursuant
    to Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, gas
    transportation services through our Atmos Pipeline —
    Texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or
    local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines,
    without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the FERC.

The RRC has issued a final rule requiring the replacement of
    known compression couplings at pre-bent gas meter risers by
    November 2009. This rule affects the operations of the Mid-Tex
    Division but is presently not anticipated to have a significant
    impact on our West Texas Division. This rule requires us to
    expend significant amounts of capital in the Mid-Tex Division,
    but these prudent and mandatory expenditures should be
    recoverable through our rates.



Competition

Although our natural gas distribution operations are not
    currently in significant direct competition with any other
    distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial
    customers within our service areas, we do compete with other
    natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for
    sales to industrial customers. We compete in all aspects of our
    business with alternative energy sources, including, in
    particular, electricity. Electric utilities offer electricity as
    a rival energy source and compete for the space heating, water
    heating and cooking markets. Promotional incentives, improved
    equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to
    the acceptability of electrical equipment. The principal means
    to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices, and
    natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in
    the residential, commercial and industrial markets. However,
    higher gas prices, coupled with the electric utilities’
    marketing efforts, have increased competition for residential
    and commercial customers. In addition, AEM competes with other
    natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and
    other related services to customers.

Our regulated transmission and storage operations currently face
    limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and
    gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation,
    storage and other services for customers.

Employees

At September 30, 2008, we had 4,750 employees,
    consisting of 4,618 employees in our regulated operations
    and 132 employees in our nonregulated operations.

ITEM 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

Our financial and operating results are subject to a number of
    risk factors, many of which are not within our control. Although
    we have tried to discuss key risk factors below, please be aware
    that other or new risks may prove to be important in the future.
    Investors should carefully consider the following discussion of
    risk factors as well as other information appearing in this
    report. These factors include the following:

The
    continuation of the unprecedented disruptions in the credit
    markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase
    our costs of capital.

We rely upon access to both short-term and long-term credit
    markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements. The global credit
    markets have been experiencing significant disruption and
    volatility in recent months, to a greater degree than has been
    seen in decades. In some cases, the ability or willingness of
    traditional sources of capital to provide financing has been
    reduced.

Historically, we have accessed the commercial paper markets to
    finance our short-term working capital needs. However, the
    disruptions in the credit markets since mid-September 2008 have
    limited our access to the commercial paper markets.
    Consequently, we have borrowed directly under our primary credit
    facility that backstops our commercial paper program to provide
    much of our working capital. This credit facility provides up to
    $600 million in committed financing through its expiration
    in December 2011; however, one lender with a 5.55% share of the
    commitments has ceased funding, effectively reducing the
    facility’s size to $567 million. Our borrowings under
    this facility, along with our commercial paper, have been used
    primarily to purchase natural gas supply for the upcoming winter
    heating season. The amount of our working capital requirements
    in the near-term will depend primarily on the market price of
    natural gas. Higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our
    accounts receivable collections and may require us to increase
    borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our operations.
    The cost of both our borrowings under the primary credit
    facility and our commercial paper has increased significantly
    since mid-September 2008. We have historically supplemented our
    commercial paper program with a short-term committed credit
    facility that must be renewed annually. No borrowings are
    currently outstanding under this $212.5 million facility,
    which matures at the end of October 2009.

Our long-term debt is currently rated as “investment
    grade” by Standard & Poor’s Corporation,
    Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. If
    continuing adverse credit conditions cause a significant
    limitation on our access to the private and public credit
    markets, we could see a reduction in our liquidity. A
    significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a
    negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in
    our credit ratings by one or more of the three credit rating
    agencies. If we were to lose our investment-grade rating from
    any of the three credit rating agencies, we would lose our
    ability to issue unsecured long-term debt in the capital markets
    without further regulatory approval due to restrictions imposed
    by one of the state regulatory commissions that regulates our
    natural gas distribution business. Additionally, such a
    downgrade could even further limit our access to private credit
    markets and increase the costs of borrowing under credit lines
    that could be available.

Further, if our credit ratings were downgraded, we could be
    required to provide additional liquidity to our natural gas
    marketing segment because the commodity financial instruments
    markets could become unavailable to us. Our natural gas
    marketing segment depends primarily upon an uncommitted demand
    $580 million credit facility to finance its working capital
    needs, which it uses primarily to issue standby letters of
    credit to its natural gas suppliers. Although the availability
    of credit under this facility has not yet been affected, the
    continuation of current market conditions could adversely affect
    such availability. A significant reduction in such availability
    could require us to provide extra liquidity to support its
    operations or reduce some of the activities of our natural gas
    marketing segment. Our ability to provide extra liquidity is
    limited by the terms of our existing lending arrangements with
    AEH, which are subject to annual approval by one state
    regulatory commission.

A continuation of the recent deterioration in credit markets
    could also adversely impact our plans to refinance debt that
    matures at the beginning of fiscal 2010. We financed our TXU Gas
    acquisition in October 2004 in part with the proceeds of our
    4% senior notes due 2009. The $400 million principal
    amount of these



notes matures in October 2009 and we plan to access the capital
    markets to refinance this debt prior to maturity. A continuation
    of current market conditions could adversely affect the cost or
    other terms of such refinancing.

While we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our
    operations and the sources of financing available to us, we can
    provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so
    in the future, especially if the market price of natural gas
    increases significantly in the near-term. The future effects on
    our business, liquidity and financial results of a continuation
    of current market conditions could be material and adverse to
    us, both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do
    not currently anticipate.

The
    continuation of recent economic conditions could adversely
    affect our customers and negatively impact our financial
    results.

The slowdown in the U.S. economy, together with increased
    mortgage defaults and significant decreases in the values of
    homes and investment assets, has adversely affected the
    financial resources of many domestic households. It is unclear
    whether the administrative and legislative responses to these
    conditions will be successful in avoiding a recession or in
    lessening the severity or duration of a recession. As a result,
    our customers may seek to use less gas in upcoming heating
    seasons and it may become more difficult for them to pay their
    gas bills. This may slow collections and lead to higher than
    normal levels of accounts receivable. This in turn could
    increase our financing requirements and bad debt expense.

The
    costs of providing pension and postretirement health care
    benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes
    in pension fund values, changing demographics and fluctuating
    actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse effect on
    our financial results.

We provide a cash-balance pension plan and postretirement
    healthcare benefits to eligible full-time employees. Our costs
    of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are
    subject to changes in the market value of the assets funding our
    pension and postretirement healthcare plans. The recent
    significant decline in the value of investments that fund our
    pension and postretirement healthcare plans may significantly
    differ from or alter the values and actuarial assumptions we use
    to calculate our future pension plan expense and postretirement
    healthcare costs. A continuation or further decline in the value
    of these investments could increase the expenses of our pension
    and postretirement healthcare plans and related funding
    requirements in the future. Our costs of providing such benefits
    and related funding requirements are also subject to changing
    demographics, including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries
    and an expected increase in the number of eligible former
    employees over the next five to ten years, as well as various
    actuarial calculations and assumptions, which may differ
    materially from actual results due to changing market and
    economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates and
    interest rates and other factors.

Our
    operations are exposed to market risks that are beyond our
    control which could adversely affect our financial results and
    capital requirements.

Our risk management operations are subject to market risks
    beyond our control, including market liquidity, commodity price
    volatility and counterparty creditworthiness. Although we
    maintain a risk management policy, we may not be able to
    completely offset the price risk associated with volatile gas
    prices or the risk in our natural gas marketing and pipeline,
    storage and other segments, which could lead to volatility in
    our earnings. Physical trading also introduces price risk on any
    net open positions at the end of each trading day, as well as
    volatility resulting from

intra-day

fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price
    movements between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for
    future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is
    hedged. Although we manage our business to maintain no open
    positions, there are times when limited net open positions
    related to our physical storage may occur on a short-term basis.
    The determination of our net open position as of the end of any
    particular trading day requires us to make assumptions as to
    future circumstances, including the use of gas by our customers
    in relation to our anticipated storage and market positions.
    Because the price risk associated with any net open position at
    the end of such day may increase if the assumptions are not
    realized, we review these assumptions as part of our daily
    monitoring activities. Net open positions may increase
    volatility in our financial condition or results of



operations if market prices move in a significantly favorable or
    unfavorable manner because the timing of the recognition of
    profits or losses on the hedges for financial accounting
    purposes usually do not match up with the timing of the economic
    profits or losses on the item being hedged. This volatility may
    occur with a resulting increase or decrease in earnings or
    losses, even though the expected profit margin is essentially
    unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated.
    Further, if the local physical markets in which we trade do not
    move consistently with the NYMEX futures market, we could
    experience increased volatility in the financial results of our
    natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments.

Our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other
    segments manage margins and limit risk exposure on the sale of
    natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixed-price purchase or
    sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through
    the use of a variety of financial instruments. However,
    contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to
    withdraw gas from storage, which could cause us to purchase gas
    at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes
    to fulfill customer contracts. We could also realize financial
    losses on our efforts to limit risk as a result of volatility in
    the market prices of the underlying commodities or if a
    counterparty fails to perform under a contract. A continued
    tightening of the credit market could cause more of our
    counterparties to fail to perform than expected and reserved. In
    addition, adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our
    counterparties could limit the level of trading activities with
    these parties and increase the risk that these parties may not
    perform under a contract. These circumstances could also
    increase our capital requirements.

We are also subject to interest rate risk on our borrowings. In
    recent years, we have been operating in a relatively low
    interest-rate environment with both short and long-term interest
    rates being relatively low compared to historical interest
    rates. However, increases in interest rates could adversely
    affect our future financial results.

We are
    subject to state and local regulations that affect our
    operations and financial results.

Our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and
    storage segments are subject to various regulated returns on our
    rate base in each jurisdiction in which we operate. We monitor
    the allowed rates of return and our effectiveness in earning
    such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating changes as
    we believe are needed. In addition, in the normal course of
    business in the regulatory environment, assets may be placed in
    service and historical test periods established before rate
    cases can be filed that could result in an adjustment of our
    returns. Once rate cases are filed, regulatory bodies have the
    authority to suspend implementation of the new rates while
    studying the cases. Because of this process, we must suffer the
    negative financial effects of having placed assets in service
    without the benefit of rate relief, which is commonly referred
    to as “regulatory lag”. Rate cases also involve a risk
    of rate reduction, because once rates have been approved, they
    are still subject to challenge for their reasonableness by
    appropriate regulatory authorities. In addition, regulators may
    review our purchases of natural gas and can adjust the amount of
    our gas costs that we pass through to our customers. Finally,
    our debt and equity financings are also subject to approval by
    regulatory bodies in several states, which could limit our
    ability to access or take advantage of changes in the capital
    markets.

Some
    of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory
    oversight that could affect our operations and financial
    results.

FERC has regulatory authority that affects some of our
    operations, including sales of natural gas in the wholesale gas
    market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and
    storage capacity. Under legislation passed by Congress in 2005,
    FERC has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse
    and market manipulation and to promote compliance with
    FERC’s other rules, policies and orders by companies
    engaged in the sale, purchase, transportation or storage of
    natural gas in interstate commerce. These rules carry increased
    penalties for violations. We are currently under investigation
    by FERC for possible violations of FERC’s posting and
    competitive bidding regulations for pre-arranged released firm
    capacity on interstate natural gas pipelines. Although we are
    currently taking action to structure current and future
    transactions to comply with applicable FERC regulations, we are
    unable to predict the impact that these rules or any future
    regulatory activities of FERC and other federal agencies will
    have on our operations or financial results. Changes in
    regulations or their interpretation or additional regulations
    could adversely affect our business or financial results.



We are
    subject to environmental regulations which could adversely
    affect our operations or financial results.

We are subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements
    enacted or adopted by federal, state and local governmental
    authorities relating to protection of the environment and health
    and safety matters, including those legal requirements that
    govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the
    management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, the

clean-up

of
    contaminated sites, groundwater quality and availability, plant
    and wildlife protection, as well as work practices related to
    employee health and safety. Environmental legislation also
    requires that our facilities, sites and other properties
    associated with our operations be operated, maintained,
    abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable
    regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with these laws,
    regulations, permits and licenses may expose us to fines,
    penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be
    significant to our financial results. In addition, existing
    environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may
    become subject to new regulations. In addition, there are a
    number of new federal and state legislative and regulatory
    initiatives being proposed and adopted in an attempt to control
    or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate
    change, including greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon
    dioxide. Such revised or new regulations could result in
    increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions
    which could adversely affect our business, financial condition
    or financial results.

The
    concentration of our distribution, pipeline and storage
    operations in the State of Texas exposes our operations and
    financial results to economic conditions and regulatory
    decisions in Texas.

As a result of our acquisition of the distribution, pipeline and
    storage operations of TXU Gas in October 2004, over
    50 percent of our natural gas distribution customers and
    most of our pipeline and storage assets and operations are
    located in the State of Texas. This concentration of our
    business in Texas means that our operations and financial
    results may be significantly affected by changes in the Texas
    economy in general and regulatory decisions by state and local
    regulatory authorities in Texas.

Adverse
    weather conditions could affect our operations or financial
    results.

Since the

2006-2007

winter heating season, we have had weather-normalized rates for
    over 90 percent of our residential and commercial meters,
    which has substantially mitigated the adverse effects of
    warmer-than-normal weather for meters in those service areas.
    However, there is no assurance that we will continue to receive
    such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in
    the future. The loss of such weather — normalized
    rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and
    financial results. In addition, our natural gas distribution and
    regulated transmission and storage operating results may
    continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during
    the winter heating season. Sustained cold weather could
    adversely affect our natural gas marketing operations as we may
    be required to purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to
    obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts.

Inflation
    and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base
    and customer collections and increase our level of
    indebtedness.

Inflation has caused increases in some of our operating expenses
    and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs. We have
    a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our
    natural gas distribution gas rates in relation to the increasing
    cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in
    adjusting those gas rates. Historically, we have been able to
    budget and control operating expenses and investments within the
    amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to
    continue to do so. However, the ability to control expenses is
    an important factor that could impact future financial results.

Rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas, which has
    occurred in recent years, cause us to experience a significant
    increase in short-term debt. We must pay suppliers for gas when
    it is purchased, which can be significantly in advance of when
    these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly
    customer bills for gas delivered. Increases in purchased gas
    costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts
    as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas
    bills, leading to higher than normal accounts



receivable. This could result in higher short-term debt levels,
    greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.

Our
    growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our
    business, which requires extensive capital
    spending.

We must continually build additional capacity in our natural gas
    distribution system to maintain the growth in the number of our
    customers. The cost of adding this capacity may be affected by a
    number of factors, including the general state of the economy
    and weather. Our cash flows from operations generally are
    sufficient to supply funding for all our capital expenditures,
    including the financing of the costs of new construction along
    with capital expenditures necessary to maintain our existing
    natural gas system. Due to the timing of these cash flows and
    capital expenditures, we often must fund at least a portion of
    these costs through borrowing funds from third party lenders,
    the cost and availability of which is dependent on the liquidity
    of the credit markets, interest rates and other market
    conditions. This in turn may limit our ability to connect new
    customers to our system due to constraints on the amount of
    funds we can invest in our infrastructure.

Our
    operations are subject to increased competition.

In residential and commercial customer markets, our natural gas
    distribution operations compete with other energy products, such
    as electricity and propane. Our primary product competition is
    with electricity for heating, water heating and cooking.
    Increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact
    our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of
    natural gas to the consumer. This could adversely impact our
    business if, as a result, our customer growth slows, reducing
    our ability to make capital expenditures, or if our customers
    further conserve their use of gas, resulting in reduced gas
    purchases and customer billings.

In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing
    plants, adverse economic conditions, including higher gas costs,
    could cause these customers to use alternative sources of
    energy, such as electricity, or bypass our systems in favor of
    special competitive contracts with lower

per-unit

costs. Our regulated transmission and storage segment currently
    faces limited competition from other existing intrastate
    pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange
    transportation, storage and other services for customers.
    However, competition may increase if new intrastate pipelines
    are constructed near our existing facilities.

Distributing
    and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in
    accidents and additional operating costs.

Our natural gas distribution business involves a number of
    hazards and operating risks that cannot be completely avoided,
    such as leaks, accidents and operational problems, which could
    cause loss of human life, as well as substantial financial
    losses resulting from property damage, damage to the environment
    and to our operations. We do have liability and property
    insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks.
    However, because our pipeline, storage and distribution
    facilities are near or are in populated areas, any loss of human
    life or adverse financial results resulting from such events
    could be large. If these events were not fully covered by
    insurance, our operations or financial results could be
    adversely affected.

Natural
    disasters, terrorist activities or other significant events
    could adversely affect our operations or financial
    results.

Natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and
    operations. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities
    could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in
    the price of natural gas that could affect our operations. Also,
    companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure
    to actual acts of terrorism, which could subject our operations
    to increased risks. As a result, the availability of insurance
    covering such risks may be more limited, which could increase
    the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or
    financial results.

Properties.

Distribution,
    transmission and related assets

At September 30, 2008, our natural gas distribution segment
    owned an aggregate of 77,462 miles of underground
    distribution and transmission mains throughout our gas
    distribution systems. These mains are located on easements or
    rights-of-way which generally provide for perpetual use. We
    maintain our mains through a program of continuous inspection
    and repair and believe that our system of mains is in good
    condition. Our regulated transmission and storage segment owned
    6,069 miles of gas transmission and gathering lines and our
    pipeline, storage and other segment owned 114 miles of gas
    transmission and gathering lines.

Storage

ITEM 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

INTRODUCTION

This section provides management’s discussion of the
    financial condition, changes in financial condition and results
    of operations of Atmos Energy Corporation and its consolidated
    subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations
    and liquidity and capital resources. It includes
    management’s interpretation of our financial results, the
    factors affecting these results, the major factors expected to
    affect future operating results and future investment and
    financing plans. This discussion should be read in conjunction
    with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

Several factors exist that could influence our future financial
    performance, some of which are described in Item 1A above,
    “Risk Factors”. They should be considered in
    connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained
    in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since
    these factors could cause actual results and conditions to
    differ materially from those set out in such forward-looking
    statements.

Cautionary
    Statement for the Purposes of the Safe Harbor under the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

The statements contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

may contain “forward-looking statements” within the
    meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All
    statements other than statements of historical fact included in
    this Report are forward-looking statements made in good faith by
    us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from
    liability established by the Private Securities Litigation
    Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, or any other of
    our documents or oral presentations, the words
    “anticipate”, “believe”,
    “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”,
    “goal”, “intend”, “objective”,
    “plan”, “projection”, “seek”,
    “strategy” or similar words are intended to identify
    forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are
    subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
    results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in
    the statements relating to our strategy, operations, markets,
    services, rates, recovery of costs, availability of gas supply
    and other factors. These risks and uncertainties include the
    following: our ability to continue to access the credit markets
    to satisfy our liquidity requirements; the impact of recent
    economic conditions on our customers; increased costs of
    providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and
    increased funding requirements; market risks beyond our control
    affecting our risk management activities including market
    liquidity, commodity price volatility, increasing interest rates
    and counterparty creditworthiness; regulatory trends and
    decisions, including the impact of rate proceedings before
    various state regulatory commissions; increased federal
    regulatory oversight and potential penalties; the impact of
    environmental regulations on our business; the concentration of
    our distribution, pipeline and storage operations in Texas;
    adverse weather conditions; the effects of inflation and changes
    in the availability and price of natural gas; the
    capital-intensive nature of our gas distribution business;
    increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative
    forms of energy; the inherent hazards and risks involved in
    operating our gas distribution business, natural disasters,
    terrorist activities or other events, and other risks and
    uncertainties discussed herein, especially those discussed in
    Item 1A above, all of which are difficult to predict and
    many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, while we
    believe these forward-looking statements to be reasonable, there
    can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience
    or that the expectations derived from them will be realized.
    Further, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of
    our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new
    information, future events or otherwise.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States. Preparation of these financial statements
    requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
    reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
    and the related disclosures of contingent assets and
    liabilities. We based our estimates on historical experience and
    various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
    the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our
    estimates, including those related to risk management and
    trading activities, allowance for doubtful



accounts, legal and environmental accruals, insurance accruals,
    pension and postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes
    and valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets
    and other long-lived assets. Our critical accounting policies
    are reviewed by the Audit Committee quarterly. Actual results
    may differ from estimates.

Regulation

— Our natural gas distribution and
    regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to
    regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of
    accounting records and various other matters by the respective
    regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. Our
    regulated operations are accounted for in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 71,

Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
    Regulation

. This statement requires cost-based,
    rate-regulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect
    the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices
    and policies of the various regulatory commissions in their
    financial statements. We record regulatory assets for costs that
    have been deferred for which future recovery through customer
    rates is considered probable. Regulatory liabilities are
    recorded when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for
    amounts that will be credited to customers through the
    ratemaking process. As a result, certain costs that would
    normally be expensed under accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States are permitted to be capitalized or
    deferred on the balance sheet because they can be recovered
    through rates. Discontinuing the application of SFAS 71
    could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer
    costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance
    sheet, which could reduce our net income. Further, regulation
    may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are
    recognized. The amounts to be recovered or recognized are based
    upon historical experience and our understanding of the
    regulations. The impact of regulation on our natural gas
    distribution operations may be affected by decisions of the
    regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations.

Revenue recognition

— Sales of natural gas to
    our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly
    basis; however, the billing cycle periods for certain classes of
    customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods
    used for financial reporting purposes. We follow the revenue
    accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution
    segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to
    customers, but not yet billed under the cycle billing method,
    are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to
    expense.

On occasion, we are permitted to implement new rates that have
    not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities, which
    are subject to refund. As permitted by SFAS No. 71, we
    recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that
    could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction
    in which the rates were implemented.

Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for
    increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through
    purchased gas adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas adjustment
    mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering
    purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate
    case to address all of the utility company’s non-gas costs.
    These mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory
    authorities recognize a particular type of cost, such as
    purchased gas costs, that (i) is subject to significant
    price fluctuations compared to the utility company’s other
    costs, (ii) represents a large component of the utility
    company’s cost of service and (iii) is generally
    outside the control of the gas utility company. There is no
    gross profit generated through purchased gas adjustments, but
    they provide a dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or
    decreases in utility gas costs. Although substantially all
    natural gas distribution sales to our customers fluctuate with
    the cost of gas that we purchase, our gross profit is generally
    not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas as a result of
    the purchased gas adjustment mechanism. The effects of these
    purchased gas adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas
    costs on our balance sheet.

Operating revenues for our regulated transmission and storage
    and pipeline, storage and other segments are recognized in the
    period in which actual volumes are transported and storage
    services are provided.

Operating revenues for our natural gas marketing segment and the
    associated carrying value of natural gas inventory (inclusive of
    storage costs) are recognized when we sell the gas and
    physically deliver it to our customers. Operating revenues
    include realized gains and losses arising from the settlement of
    financial instruments used in our natural gas marketing
    activities and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes



in the fair value of natural gas inventory designated as a
    hedged item in a fair value hedge and the associated financial
    instruments.

Allowance for doubtful accounts

— Accounts
    receivable consist of natural gas sales to residential,
    commercial, industrial, municipal and other customers. For the
    majority of our receivables, we establish an allowance for
    doubtful accounts based on our collections experience. On
    certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific
    customer’s inability or reluctance to pay, we record an
    allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce
    the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to
    collect. However, if circumstances change, our estimate of the
    recoverability of accounts receivable could be affected.
    Circumstances which could affect our estimates include, but are
    not limited to, customer credit issues, the level of natural gas
    prices, customer deposits and general economic conditions.
    Accounts are written off once they are deemed to be
    uncollectible.

Financial instruments and hedging activities

— We currently use financial instruments to
    mitigate commodity price risk. Additionally, we periodically use
    financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. The
    objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have
    been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and
    nonregulated businesses.

We record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet
    at fair value as required by SFAS 133,

Accounting for
    Derivatives and Hedging Activities,

with changes in fair
    value ultimately recorded in the income statement. We determine
    fair values primarily through prices actively quoted on national
    exchanges, which we believe correspond to the market in which
    transactions involving these financial instruments are executed.
    We utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair
    value in those limited circumstances where external sources are
    not available. Values are adjusted accordingly to reflect the
    potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over
    a reasonable period of time under then current market
    conditions. Amounts reported at fair value are subject to
    potentially significant volatility based upon changes in market
    prices, the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts,
    maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated
    transactions, each of which directly affect the estimated fair
    value of our financial instruments. We believe the market prices
    and models used to value these financial instruments represent
    the best information available with respect to closing exchange
    and over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility
    factors underlying the contracts. Values are adjusted to reflect
    the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions
    over a reasonable period of time under then current market
    conditions.

Fair value estimates also consider the creditworthiness of our
    counterparties. Our counterparties consist primarily of
    financial institutions and major energy companies. This
    concentration of counterparties may materially impact our
    exposure to credit risk resulting from market, economic or
    regulatory conditions. Recent adverse developments in the global
    financial and credit markets have made it more difficult and
    more expensive for companies to access the short-term capital
    markets, which may negatively impact the creditworthiness of our
    counterparties. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk
    through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit
    ratings and collateral requirements under certain circumstances,
    including the use of master netting agreements in our natural
    gas marketing segment.

The timing of when changes in fair value of our financial
    instruments are recorded in the income statement depends on
    whether the financial instrument has been designated and
    qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory
    rulings require a different accounting treatment. Changes in
    fair value for financial instruments that do not meet one of
    these criteria are recognized in the income statement as they
    occur.

Financial
    Instruments Associated with Commodity Price Risk

In our natural gas distribution segment, our customers are
    exposed to the effect of volatile natural gas prices. We manage
    this exposure through a combination of physical storage,
    fixed-price forward contracts and financial instruments,
    primarily over-the-counter swap and option contracts, in an
    effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on
    our customers during the winter heating season. The costs
    associated with and the gains and losses arising from the use of
    financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk in this
    segment are included in our purchased gas adjustment mechanisms
    in accordance with regulatory requirements. Therefore, changes
    in the fair value of these financial instruments are initially
    recorded as a



component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the
    consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas
    cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and
    recognized in revenue in accordance with SFAS 71.
    Accordingly, there is no earnings impact to our natural gas
    distribution segment as a result of the use of financial
    instruments.

Our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas
    supply, arranges transportation

and/or

storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers
    at competitive prices. We also perform asset optimization
    activities in both our natural gas marketing segment and
    pipeline, storage and other segment. As a result of these
    activities, our nonregulated operations are exposed to risks
    associated with changes in the market price of natural gas. We
    manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes
    through a combination of physical storage and financial
    instruments, including futures, over-the-counter and
    exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties.

In our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other
    segments, we have designated the natural gas inventory held by
    these operating segments as the hedged item in a fair-value
    hedge. This inventory is marked to market at the end of each
    month based on the Gas Daily index, with changes in fair value
    recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the
    period of change. The financial instruments associated with this
    natural gas inventory have been designated as fair-value hedges
    and are marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price
    with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or
    losses in revenue in the period of change. Changes in the
    spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the
    financial instruments designated against our physical inventory
    (NYMEX) and the market (spot) prices used to value our physical
    storage (Gas Daily) result in unrealized margins until the
    underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial
    instruments are settled. The difference in the spot price used
    to value our physical inventory and the forward price used to
    value the related financial instruments can result in volatility
    in our reported income as a component of unrealized margins. We
    have elected to exclude this spot/forward differential for
    purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fair-value
    hedges. Once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments
    are settled, the previously unrealized margins associated with
    these net positions are realized. Over time, we expect gains and
    losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be offset by
    gains and losses on the fair-value hedges, resulting in the
    realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated
    at the time we structured the original transaction.

We have elected to treat fixed-price forward contracts used in
    our natural gas marketing segment to deliver gas as normal
    purchases and normal sales. As such, these deliveries are
    recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with our revenue
    recognition policy. Financial instruments used to mitigate the
    commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been
    designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and
    sales at indexed prices. Accordingly, unrealized gains and
    losses on open financial instruments are recorded as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in
    earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are
    sold. Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred, is reported
    as a component of revenue.

We also use storage swaps and futures to capture additional
    storage arbitrage opportunities in our natural gas marketing
    segment that arise after the execution of the original fair
    value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory,
    basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our
    fixed price and storage books and various over-the-counter and
    exchange-traded options. These financial instruments have not
    been designated as hedges in accordance with SFAS 133.

Financial
    Instruments Associated with Interest Rate Risk

We periodically manage interest rate risk, typically when we
    issue new or refinance existing long-term debt. Currently, we do
    not have any financial instruments in place to manage interest
    rate risk. However, in prior years, we entered into Treasury
    lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the
    interest cost associated with anticipated financings. We
    designated these Treasury lock agreements as a cash flow hedge
    of an anticipated transaction at the time the agreements were
    executed. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses associated
    with the Treasury lock agreements were recorded as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The realized
    gain or loss recognized upon settlement of each Treasury lock
    agreement was



initially recorded as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) and is recognized as a component of
    interest expense over the life of the related financing
    arrangement.

Impairment assessments

— We perform impairment
    assessments of our goodwill, intangible assets subject to
    amortization and long-lived assets. We currently have no
    indefinite-lived intangible assets.

We annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during
    our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise. We
    use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to
    estimate the fair value of our reporting units. We have
    determined our reporting units to be each of our natural gas
    distribution divisions and wholly-owned subsidiaries and
    goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the
    acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill. The discounted cash
    flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are
    dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of
    future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rate. An
    impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a
    reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value.

We annually assess whether the cost of our intangible assets
    subject to amortization or other long-lived assets is
    recoverable or that the remaining useful lives may warrant
    revision. We perform this assessment more frequently when
    specific events or circumstances have occurred that suggest the
    recoverability of the cost of the intangible and other
    long-lived assets is at risk.

When such events or circumstances are present, we assess the
    recoverability of these assets by determining whether the
    carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash
    flows from the operating division or subsidiary to which these
    assets relate. These cash flow projections consider various
    factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the
    discount rate and are based upon the best information available
    at the time the estimate is made. Changes in these factors could
    materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the
    recognition of an impairment charge. An impairment charge is
    recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the
    fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less
    than the carrying value of the related asset.

Pension and other postretirement plans

—
    Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are
    determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous
    assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan
    assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed
    discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality
    data. Through fiscal 2008, we reviewed the estimates and
    assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan
    costs and liabilities annually based upon a June 30 measurement
    date. Effective October 1, 2008, we changed our measurement
    date to September 30. The assumed discount rate and the
    expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most
    significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities. The
    assumed discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate
    and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most
    significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and
    liabilities.

The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the
    actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement
    obligations and net pension and postretirement costs. When
    establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality
    corporate bond rates based on Moody’s Aa bond index,
    changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied
    discount rate that is derived from matching our projected
    benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate bond spot
    rate curve.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in
    calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our
    annual pension and postretirement plan costs. We estimate the
    expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond
    returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of
    active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset
    rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the
    guidance from our investment advisors in making a final
    determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the
    extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the
    course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate,
    that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan costs are
    not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases
    future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of
    approximately ten to twelve years.



We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in
    determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual
    health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted
    legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of
    retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our
    participant census information as of the measurement date.

Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and
    differences between the actual return on plan assets and the
    expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on
    the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized. A
    0.25 percent change in our discount rate would impact our
    pension and postretirement costs by approximately
    $0.9 million. A 0.25 percent change in our expected
    rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs
    by approximately $0.9 million.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

Overview

Atmos Energy Corporation is involved in the distribution,
    marketing and transportation of natural gas. Accordingly, our
    results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural
    gas, particularly during the winter heating season, and the
    volatility of the natural gas markets. This generally results in
    higher operating revenues and net income during the period from
    October through March of each fiscal year and lower operating
    revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the
    period from April through September of each fiscal year. As a
    result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry, our
    second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical
    earnings quarter with an average of approximately
    62 percent of our consolidated net income having been
    earned in the second quarter during the three most recently
    completed fiscal years.

Additionally, the seasonality of our business impacts our
    working capital differently at various times during the year.
    Typically, our accounts receivable, accounts payable and
    short-term debt balances peak by the end of January and then
    start to decline, as customers begin to pay their winter heating
    bills. Gas stored underground, particularly in our natural gas
    distribution segment, typically peaks in November and declines
    as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers.

During the current year, prices for several world energy
    commodities rose to historic levels, most significantly seen in
    unprecedented oil prices. While natural gas prices did not reach
    historic levels, they were impacted by financial speculators and
    large hedge fund trading, particularly during the summer months.
    As a result, our natural gas distribution segment’s cost of
    natural gas per Mcf sold increased 12 percent to $9.05 for
    the current fiscal year compared with $8.09 in the prior fiscal
    year. Despite these higher prices, we experienced lower price
    volatility, which reduced our natural gas marketing
    segment’s opportunity to earn arbitrage gains.

Although gas costs do not directly impact our natural gas
    distribution gross profit margin, higher natural gas prices
    could cause our natural gas distribution customers and customers
    served by our other operating segments to conserve, or in the
    case of industrial customers, switch to less expensive fuel
    sources. Further, higher natural gas prices may adversely impact
    our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad
    debt expense, and may require us to increase borrowings under
    our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense.

We normally access the commercial paper markets to finance our
    working capital needs and growth. However, recent adverse
    developments in global financial and credit markets have made it
    more difficult and more expensive for the Company to access the
    short-term capital markets, including the commercial paper
    market, to satisfy our liquidity requirements. Despite these
    conditions, we believe the amounts available to us under our
    credit facilities coupled with our operating cash flows will
    provide the necessary liquidity to fund our working capital
    needs for fiscal year 2009.

Year-over-year, net income during fiscal 2008 increased seven
    percent. Net income from our regulated operations increased
    24 percent during fiscal 2008. The increase primarily
    reflects a net $53.8 million increase in gross profit
    resulting from our ratemaking efforts, coupled with higher

per-unit

transportation margins and an 18 percent increase in
    consolidated throughput in our Atmos Pipeline — Texas
    Division. These increases were partially offset by a four
    percent increase in operating expenses. Net income in our
    nonregulated



operations experienced a 24 percent decline as less
    volatile natural gas market conditions significantly reduced our
    asset optimization margins. However, higher delivered gas
    margins in our natural gas marketing segment and unrealized
    margins partially offset this decrease.

The 14 percent year-over-year increase in net income during
    fiscal 2007 reflects improvements across all business segments.
    Results from our regulated operations reflect the net favorable
    impact of various ratemaking rulings in our natural gas
    distribution segment, including the implementation of WNA in our
    Mid-Tex and Louisiana Divisions coupled with increased
    throughput and incremental gross profit margins from our North
    Side Loop project and other pipeline compression projects
    completed in fiscal 2006. The decrease in net income from our
    nonregulated operations primarily reflects the impact of a less
    volatile natural gas market, which reduced delivered gas margins
    despite a 31 percent increase in sales volumes. However,
    our nonregulated operations benefited from higher asset
    optimization margins, primarily in the pipeline, storage and
    other segment.

Other key financial and significant events for the fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2008 include the following:

•

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, we generated
    $370.9 million in operating cash flow compared with
    $547.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30,
    2007, primarily reflecting the unfavorable timing of gas cost
    collections from our customers and cash payments to
    collateralize our risk management liabilities.

•

Capital expenditures increased to $472.3 million during the
    fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 from
    $392.4 million in the prior year. The increase primarily
    reflects an increase in compliance spending and main
    replacements in our Mid-Tex Division, spending in the natural
    gas distribution segment for our new automated meter reading
    initiative and spending for two nonregulated growth projects.

•

We repaid $10.3 million of long-term debt during the fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2008 compared with a net reduction
    of long-term debt of $56.0 million during the prior year.
    The decreased payments during the current year reflect regularly
    scheduled maturity payments compared with the prior fiscal year,
    which reflect the repayment of $303.2 million of unsecured
    floating rate senior notes with $247.2 million of net
    proceeds received from the issuance of ten year senior notes.

•

We maintained our capitalization ratio within our targeted range
    of 50 to 55 percent despite higher short-term borrowings
    under our existing

5-year

credit facility to fund seasonal natural gas purchases at higher
    prices.

See the following discussion regarding the results of operations
    for each of our business operating segments.

Fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2008 compared with fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2007

Natural
    Gas Distribution Segment

The primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas
    distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized
    rates of return, the cost of natural gas, competitive factors in
    the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas.

Our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on
    our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking
    jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and,
    ultimately, separating the recovery of our approved margins from
    customer usage patterns. Improving rate design is a long-term
    process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate
    in multiple rate jurisdictions. The “Ratemaking
    Activity” section of this

Form 10-K

describes our current rate strategy and recent ratemaking
    initiatives in more detail.

Our natural gas distribution operations are also affected by the
    cost of natural gas. The cost of gas is passed through to our
    customers without markup. Therefore, increases in the cost of
    gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues.
    Accordingly, we believe gross profit is a better indicator of
    our financial performance than revenues. However, gross profit
    in our Texas and Mississippi service areas include franchise



fees and gross receipts taxes, which are calculated as a
    percentage of revenue (inclusive of gas costs). Therefore, the
    amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the
    cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes. We record the
    tax expense as a component of taxes, other than income. Although
    changes in revenue-related taxes arising from changes in gas
    costs affect gross profit, over time the impact is offset within
    operating income. Timing differences exist between the
    recognition of revenue for franchise fees collected from our
    customers and the recognition of expense of franchise taxes. The
    effect of these timing differences can be significant in periods
    of volatile gas prices, particularly in our Mid-Tex Division.
    These timing differences may favorably or unfavorably affect net
    income; however, these amounts should offset over time with no
    permanent impact on net income.

Higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts
    receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense,
    and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit
    facilities resulting in higher interest expense. Finally, higher
    gas costs, as well as competitive factors in the industry and
    general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or
    use alternative energy sources.

The $53.4 million increase in natural gas distribution
    gross profit primarily reflects a $40.7 million net
    increase in rates. The net increase in rates primarily was
    attributable to the Mid-Tex Division which increased
    $29.2 million as a result of its 2006 GRIP filing, the
    previous and current year Mid-Tex rate cases and the absence of
    a one time GRIP refund that occurred in the prior year. The
    current year also reflects $14.4 million in rate increases
    in our Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Tennessee and West Texas
    service areas. In addition, the prior year includes a
    $7.5 million accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs
    that did not recur in the current year.

Gross profit also increased approximately $8.6 million from
    revenue-related taxes primarily due to higher revenues, on which
    the tax is calculated, in the current year compared to the prior
    year. This increase, partially offset by a $7.2 million
    period-over-period increase in the associated franchise and
    state gross receipts tax expense recorded as a component of
    taxes other than income, resulted in a $1.4 million
    increase in operating income, when compared with the prior year.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
    expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
    amortization expense and taxes, other than income, increased by
    a net $13.4 million.

The net increase was primarily reflected in our operation and
    maintenance expense, excluding the provision for doubtful
    accounts, which increased $13.3 million compared with the
    prior year. The increase principally reflects higher employee
    and administrative costs in addition to increased natural gas
    odorization and fuel costs attributable to higher commodity
    prices. The increase in operation and maintenance expense also
    reflects the absence in the current-year period of a
    nonrecurring $4.3 million deferral of hurricane-related
    operation and maintenance expenses in the prior year.

The provision for doubtful accounts decreased $3.2 million
    to $16.6 million for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2008, which reflects our continued effective
    collection efforts, despite a 12 percent rise in our
    average cost of gas per Mcf sold. As a result of these efforts,
    our provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue
    decreased from 0.61 percent in fiscal 2007 to
    0.47 percent in fiscal 2008.

Operating expenses for the prior year also include a
    $3.3 million noncash charge associated with the write-off
    of software costs.

The decrease in operating expenses attributable to the lower
    provision for doubtful accounts and the absence of the prior
    year charge were offset by the aforementioned increase in
    franchise and gross receipt taxes.

Miscellaneous
    Income

The increase in miscellaneous income primarily reflects the
    recognition of a $1.2 million gain on the sale of
    irrigation assets in our West Texas Division during the fiscal
    2008 second quarter.



Interest
    charges

Interest charges allocated to the natural gas distribution
    segment decreased $3.7 million due to lower average
    outstanding short-term debt balances in the current year
    compared with the prior year.

Regulated
    Transmission and Storage Segment

Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the
    regulated pipeline and storage operations of the Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division. The Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division transports natural gas to
    our Mid-Tex Division and third parties and manages five
    underground storage reservoirs in Texas. We also provide
    ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including
    parking arrangements, lending and sales of inventory on hand.

Similar to our natural gas distribution segment, our regulated
    transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather
    patterns, competitive factors in the energy industry and
    economic conditions in our service areas. Natural gas prices do
    not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are
    derived from the transportation of natural gas. However, natural
    gas prices could influence the level of drilling activity in the
    markets that we serve, which may influence the level of
    throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline. Further,
    as the Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division operations
    supply all of the natural gas for our Mid-Tex Division, the
    results of this segment are highly dependent upon the natural
    gas requirements of the Mid-Tex Division. Finally, as a
    regulated pipeline, the operations of the Atmos
    Pipeline — Texas Division may be impacted by the
    timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these
    costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs.

The $32.7 million increase in gross profit primarily was
    attributable to a $13.1 million increase from rate
    adjustments resulting from our 2006 and 2007 GRIP filings and an
    $8.3 million increase from transportation volumes.
    Consolidated throughput increased 18 percent primarily due
    to increased transportation in the Barnett Shale region of
    Texas. The improvement in gross profit also reflects increased
    service fees and

per-unit

transportation margins due to favorable market conditions which
    contributed $8.0 million. New compression



contracts and transportation capacity enhancements also
    contributed $1.5 million. In addition, sales of excess gas
    increased $1.3 million compared to the prior year.

Operating expenses increased $22.8 million primarily due to
    increased pipeline integrity and maintenance costs.

Natural
    Gas Marketing Segment

Our natural gas marketing activities are conducted through AEM,
    which aggregates and purchases gas supply, arranges
    transportation

and/or

storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers
    at competitive prices. To facilitate this process, we utilize
    proprietary and customer-owned transportation and storage assets
    to provide the various services our customers request, including
    furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and market-based
    prices, contract negotiation and administration, load
    forecasting, gas storage acquisition and management services,
    transportation services, peaking sales and balancing services,
    capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through
    the use of financial instruments. As a result, our revenues
    arise from the types of commercial transactions we have
    structured with our customers and include the value we extract
    by optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or
    control as well as revenues for services we deliver.

Our asset optimization activities seek to maximize the economic
    value associated with the storage and transportation capacity we
    own or control. We attempt to meet this objective by engaging in
    natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and
    profit from the pricing differences that occur over time. We
    purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial
    instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit
    margin. We also seek to participate in transactions in which we
    combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to
    minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers by
    identifying the lowest cost alternative within the natural gas
    supplies, transportation and markets to which we have access.
    Through the use of transportation and storage services and
    financial instruments, we also seek to capture gross profit
    margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences that exist
    in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that
    occur over time.

AEM continually manages its net physical position to attempt to
    increase the future economic profit that was created when the
    original transaction was executed. Therefore, AEM may
    subsequently change its originally scheduled storage injection
    and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on
    market conditions and recognize any associated gains or losses
    at that time. If AEM elects to accelerate the withdrawal of
    physical gas, it will execute new financial instruments to hedge
    the original financial instruments. If AEM elects to defer the
    withdrawal of gas, it will reset its financial instruments to
    correspond to the revised withdrawal schedule and execute new
    financial instruments to offset the original financial
    instruments.

We use financial instruments, designated as fair value hedges,
    to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our natural gas
    marketing storage activities. These financial instruments are
    marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with
    changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses
    in the period of change. The hedged natural gas inventory is
    marked to market at the end of each month based on the Gas Daily
    index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains
    and losses in the period of change. Changes in the spreads
    between the forward natural gas prices used to value the
    financial hedges designated against our physical inventory and
    the market (spot) prices used to value our physical storage
    result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas
    is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled.
    Once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are
    settled, the previously unrealized margins associated with these
    net positions are realized.

AEM also uses financial instruments to capture additional
    storage arbitrage opportunities that may arise after the
    original physical inventory hedge and to attempt to insulate and
    protect the economic value within its asset optimization
    activities. Changes in fair value associated with these
    financial instruments are recognized as a component of
    unrealized margins until they are settled.



Due to the nature of these operations, natural gas prices have a
    significant impact on our natural gas marketing operations.
    Within our delivered gas activities, higher natural gas prices
    may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections,
    resulting in higher bad debt expense, and may require us to
    increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in
    higher interest expense. Higher gas prices, as well as
    competitive factors in the industry and general economic
    conditions may also cause customers to conserve or use
    alternative energy sources. Within our asset optimization
    activities, higher gas prices could also lead to increased
    borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher
    interest expense.

Volatility in natural gas prices also has a significant impact
    on our natural gas marketing segment. Increased price volatility
    often has a significant impact on the spreads between the market
    (spot) prices and forward natural gas prices, which creates
    opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads within our asset
    optimization activities. However, increased volatility impacts
    the amounts of unrealized margins recorded in our gross profit
    and could impact the amount of cash required to collateralize
    our risk management liabilities.

Review of
    Financial and Operating Results

Financial and operational highlights for our natural gas
    marketing segment for the fiscal years ended September 30,
    2008 and 2007 are presented below. Gross profit margin consists
    primarily of margins earned from the delivery of gas and related
    services requested by our customers and margins earned from
    asset optimization activities, which are derived from the
    utilization of our proprietary and managed third party storage
    and transportation assets to capture favorable arbitrage spreads
    through natural gas trading activities.

Unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses on
    our net physical position and the related financial instruments
    used to manage commodity price risk as described above. These
    margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the
    physical and forward natural gas prices. Generally, if the
    physical/financial spread narrows, we will record unrealized
    gains or lower unrealized losses. If the physical/financial
    spread widens, we will record unrealized losses or lower
    unrealized gains. The magnitude of the unrealized gains and
    losses is also dependent upon the levels of our net physical
    position at the end of the reporting period.

The $11.3 million decrease in our natural gas marketing
    segment’s gross profit primarily reflects a
    $35.0 million decrease in realized asset optimization
    margins. As a result of less volatile natural gas market
    conditions experienced during the current year, AEM regularly
    deferred storage withdrawals and reset the



associated financial instruments to increase the potential gross
    profit it could realize from its asset optimization activities
    in future periods. As a result, AEM recognized settlement losses
    without corresponding storage withdrawal gains during the
    current year. Additionally, AEM experienced increased storage
    fees charged by third parties during the current year. In the
    prior year, AEM was able to recognize arbitrage gains as changes
    in its originally scheduled storage injection and withdrawal
    plans had a significantly smaller impact than in the current
    year.

The decrease in realized asset optimization margins was
    partially offset by a $16.6 million increase in realized
    delivered gas margins. The increase reflects both increased
    sales volumes and increased

per-unit

margins. Gross sales volumes increased eight percent compared
    with the prior year. The increase in sales volumes reflects the
    successful execution of our marketing strategies. Our

per-unit

margin increased 19 percent, which reflects increased basis
    gains on certain contracts coupled with improved marketing
    efforts. Excluding the impact of these basis gains, our

per-unit

margins increased seven percent in the current year.

Gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by a
    $7.1 million increase in unrealized margins attributable to
    a narrowing of the spreads between current cash prices and
    forward natural gas prices. The change in unrealized margins
    also reflects the recognition of previously unrealized margins
    as a component of realized margins as a result of injecting and
    withdrawing gas and settling financial instruments as a part of
    AEM’s asset optimization activities.

Operating expenses increased $7.4 million primarily
    reflecting a $2.4 million increase associated with property
    taxes coupled with a $5.0 million increase in other
    administrative costs.

Economic
    Gross Profit

AEM monitors the impact of its asset optimization efforts by
    estimating the gross profit, before associated storage fees,
    that it captured through the purchase and sale of physical
    natural gas and the execution of the associated financial
    instruments. This economic gross profit, combined with the
    effect of the future reversal of unrealized gains or losses
    currently recognized in the income statement is referred to as
    the potential gross
    profit.

Potential gross profit represents the increase in AEM’s
    gross profit in future periods if its optimization efforts are
    executed as planned. This amount does not include storage and
    other operating expenses and increased income taxes that will be
    incurred to realize this amount. Therefore, it does not
    represent an estimated increase in future net income. There is
    no assurance that the economic gross profit or the potential
    gross profit will be fully realized in the future. We consider
    this measure a non-GAAP financial measure as it is calculated
    using both forward-looking storage injection/withdrawal and
    hedge settlement estimates and historical financial information.
    This measure is presented because we believe it provides a more
    comprehensive view to investors of our asset optimization
    efforts and thus a better understanding of these activities than
    would be presented by GAAP measures alone.

As of September 30, 2008, based upon AEM’s planned
    inventory withdrawal schedule and associated planned settlement
    of financial instruments, the economic gross profit was
    $48.5 million. This amount will be reduced by
    $36.4 million of net unrealized gains recorded in the
    financial statements as of September 30, 2008 that will
    reverse when the inventory is withdrawn and the accompanying
    financial instruments are settled. Therefore, the potential
    gross profit was $12.1 million at September 30, 2008.



The economic gross profit is based upon planned storage
    injection and withdrawal schedules and its realization is
    contingent upon the execution of this plan, weather and other
    execution factors. Since AEM actively manages and optimizes its
    portfolio to attempt to enhance the future profitability of its
    storage position, it may change its scheduled storage injection
    and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on
    market conditions. Therefore, we cannot ensure that the economic
    gross profit or the potential gross profit calculated as of
    September 30, 2008 will be fully realized in the future nor
    can we predict in what time periods such realization may occur.
    Further, if we experience operational or other issues which
    limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions,
    our earnings could be adversely impacted. Assuming AEM fully
    executes its plan in place on September 30, 2008, without
    encountering operational or other issues, we anticipate the
    majority of the potential gross profit as of September 30,
    2008 will be recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2009
    with the remainder recognized over the remaining months in
    fiscal 2009.

Pipeline,
    Storage and Other Segment

Our pipeline, storage and other segment primarily consists of
    the operations of Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC (APS), Atmos
    Energy Services, LLC (AES) and Atmos Power Systems, Inc., which
    are each wholly-owned by AEH.

APS owns and operates a 21 mile pipeline located in New
    Orleans, Louisiana. This pipeline is primarily used to aggregate
    gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division
    in Louisiana and for AEM. However, it also provides limited
    third party transportation services. APS also owns or has an
    interest in underground storage fields in Kentucky and
    Louisiana. We use these storage facilities to reduce the need to
    contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer
    demand during peak periods. Finally, beginning in fiscal 2006,
    APS initiated activities in the natural gas gathering business.
    As of September 30, 2008, these activities were limited in
    nature.

APS also engages in limited asset optimization activities
    whereby it seeks to maximize the economic value associated with
    the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls.
    Most of these arrangements are with regulated affiliates of the
    Company and have been approved by applicable state regulatory
    commissions. Generally, these arrangements require APS to share
    with our regulated customers a portion of the profits earned
    from these arrangements.

AES, through December 31, 2006, provided natural gas
    management services to our natural gas distribution operations,
    other than the Mid-Tex Division. These services included
    aggregating and purchasing gas supply, arranging transportation
    and storage logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our
    natural gas distribution service areas at competitive prices.
    Effective January 1, 2007, our shared services function
    began providing these services to our natural gas distribution
    operations. AES continues to provide limited services to our
    natural gas distribution divisions, and the revenues AES
    receives are equal to the costs incurred to provide those
    services.

Through Atmos Power Systems, Inc., we have constructed electric
    peaking power-generating plants and associated facilities and
    lease these plants through lease agreements that are accounted
    for as sales under generally accepted accounting principles.

Results for this segment are primarily impacted by seasonal
    weather patterns and, similar to our natural gas marketing
    segment, volatility in the natural gas markets. Additionally,
    this segment’s results include an unrealized component as
    APS hedges its risk associated with its asset optimization
    activities.

Pipeline, storage and other gross profit decreased
    $4.3 million primarily due to a $6.7 million decrease
    in asset optimization margins as a result of a less volatile
    natural gas market. The decrease in asset optimization margins
    was partially offset by an increase of $2.6 million in
    unrealized margins associated with asset optimization activities.

Operating expenses decreased $2.3 million primarily due to
    the absence in the current year of a $3.0 million noncash
    charge recorded in the prior year related to the write-off of
    costs associated with a natural gas gathering project.

Adjusted for service areas that have weather-normalized
    operations. For service areas that have weather normalized
    operations, normal degree days are used instead of actual degree
    days in computing the total number of heating degree days.

The $27.6 million increase in natural gas distribution
    gross profit primarily reflects a nine percent increase in
    throughput and the impact of having WNA coverage for more than
    90 percent of our residential



and commercial customers, partially offset by an accrual for
    estimated unrecoverable gas costs and lower irrigation margins
    discussed below. The impact of higher throughput and greater WNA
    coverage increased gross profit by $38.6 million. Included
    in this amount was a $10.8 million increase associated with
    the implementation of WNA in our Mid-Tex and Louisiana Divisions
    beginning with the

2006-2007

winter heating season.

As a result of the Mid-Tex rate case, our gas distribution gross
    profit increased by $5.4 million compared to the prior
    year. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in
    Mid-Tex transportation revenue as the rate case reduced the
    transportation rates for certain customer classes. The Mid-Tex
    rate case also required the refund of $2.9 million
    collected under GRIP, which reduced gross profit in the current
    year.

Favorable regulatory activity in the current year increased
    gross profit by $24.4 million, primarily due to an
    $11.8 million increase in GRIP-related recoveries and a
    $10.2 million increase from our Rate Stabilization Clause
    (RSC) filings in our Louisiana service areas. These increases
    were partially offset by an $11.6 million decrease in gross
    profit associated with regulatory rulings in our Tennessee,
    Louisiana and Virginia jurisdictions.

Offsetting these increases in gross profit was a reduction in
    revenue-related taxes. Due to a significant decline in the cost
    of gas in the current-year period compared with the prior-year
    period, franchise and state gross receipts taxes included in
    gross profit decreased approximately $2.7 million; however,
    franchise and state gross receipts tax expense recorded as a
    component of taxes, other than income decreased
    $5.4 million, which resulted in a $2.7 million
    increase in operating income when compared with the prior-year
    period.

Natural gas distribution gross profit also reflects a
    $7.5 million accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs.
    The remaining decrease in gross profit primarily is attributable
    to lower irrigation margins and a reduction in pass-through
    surcharges used to recover various costs as these costs were
    fully recovered by the end of fiscal 2006 and during fiscal 2007.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
    expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
    amortization expense, taxes, other than income, and impairment
    of long-lived assets, increased to $731.5 million for the
    fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 from
    $723.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30,
    2006.

Operation and maintenance expense, excluding the provision for
    doubtful accounts, increased $22.4 million, primarily due
    to increased employee and other administrative costs. These
    increases include the personnel and other operating costs
    associated with the transfer of our gas supply function from our
    pipeline, storage and other segment to our natural gas
    distribution segment effective January 1, 2007. Partially
    offsetting these increases was the deferral of $4.3 million
    of operation and maintenance expense in our Louisiana Division
    resulting from the Louisiana Public Service Commission’s
    ruling to allow recovery of all incremental operation and
    maintenance expense incurred in fiscal 2005 and 2006 in
    connection with our Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts.

The provision for doubtful accounts decreased $0.8 million
    to $19.8 million for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2007. The decrease primarily was attributable
    to reduced collection risk as a result of lower natural gas
    prices. In the natural gas distribution segment, the average
    cost of natural gas for the fiscal year ended September 30,
    2007 was $8.09 per Mcf, compared with $10.02 per Mcf for the
    year ended September 30, 2006.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased
    $12.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30,
    2007 compared with the prior-year period. The increase was
    primarily attributable to increases in assets placed in service
    during fiscal 2007. Additionally, the increase was partially
    attributable to the absence in the current-year period of a
    $2.8 million reduction in depreciation expense recorded in
    the prior-year period arising from the Mississippi Public
    Service Commission’s decision to allow certain deferred
    costs in our rate base.

Operating expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30,
    2007 included a $3.3 million noncash charge associated with
    the write-off of costs for software that will no longer be used.
    Fiscal 2006 results included a $22.9 million noncash charge
    to impair the West Texas Division irrigation properties.



Interest
    charges

Interest charges allocated to the natural gas distribution
    segment for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007
    decreased to $121.6 million from $126.5 million for
    the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006. The decrease
    primarily was attributable to lower average outstanding
    short-term debt balances in the current-year period compared
    with the prior-year period.

The $22.1 million increase in gross profit primarily is
    attributable to a 23 percent increase in throughput due to
    colder weather in the current year and incremental volumes from
    the North Side Loop and other compression projects. These
    activities increased gross profit by $16.2 million, of
    which, $10.8 million was associated with our North Side
    Loop and other compression projects completed in fiscal 2006.
    Increases in gross profit also include a $3.1 million
    increase from rate adjustments resulting from our 2005 GRIP
    filing, a $2.1 million increase from the sale of excess gas
    inventory and a $2.0 million increase from new or
    renegotiated blending and capacity enhancement contracts.

Operating expenses increased to $83.4 million for the
    fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 from
    $77.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30,
    2006 due to higher administrative and other operating costs
    primarily associated with the North Side Loop and other
    compression projects that were completed in fiscal 2006.

Interest

Interest charges allocated to the pipeline and storage segment
    for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 increased to
    $27.9 million from $22.8 million for the fiscal year

    the use of updated allocation factors for fiscal 2007. These
    factors are reviewed and updated on an annual basis.

The $26.3 million decrease in our natural gas marketing
    segment’s gross profit primarily reflects a
    $30.2 million decrease in delivered gas margins. This
    decrease reflects the impact of a less volatile market, which
    reduced opportunities to take advantage of pricing differences
    between hubs, partially offset by a 31 percent increase in
    sales volumes attributable to successful execution of our
    marketing strategies and colder weather in the 2007 fiscal year
    compared with the 2006 fiscal year.

Asset optimization margins increased $2.6 million compared
    with the 2006 fiscal year. The increase reflects greater cycled
    storage volumes as a result of accelerating storage withdrawals
    scheduled in future periods to capture greater arbitrage gains
    during the current-year period, partially offset by an increase
    in storage fees and park and loan fees which reduced the
    arbitrage spreads available.

Gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by a
    $1.3 million increase in unrealized margins attributable to
    a narrowing of the spreads between current cash prices and
    forward natural gas prices. The change in unrealized margins
    also reflects the recognition of previously unrealized margins
    as a component of realized margins as a result of injecting and
    withdrawing gas and settling financial instruments as a part of
    AEM’s asset optimization activities.

Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance
    expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and
    amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes,
    increased to $29.3 million for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2007 from $28.4 million for the fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2006. The increase in operating
    expense primarily was attributable to an increase in employee
    and other administrative costs.

Miscellaneous
    income

Miscellaneous income increased to $6.4 million for the
    fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 from $2.6 million
    for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006. The increase
    primarily was attributable to increased investment income earned
    on overnight investments during the current-year period combined
    with increased



interest income earned on our margin account associated with
    increased margin requirements during the current year.

Interest
    charges

Interest charges for the fiscal year ended September 30,
    2007 decreased to $5.8 million from $8.5 million for
    the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006. The decrease was
    attributable to lower borrowing requirements during the
    current-year period.

Pipeline,
    Storage and Other Segment

Gross profit increased $8.1 million primarily due to
    APS’ ability to capture more favorable arbitrage spreads
    from its asset optimization activities, an increase in asset
    optimization contracts and increased transportation margins.

Operating expenses increased to $10.4 million for the
    fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 from $9.6 million
    for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 primarily due
    to a $3.0 million noncash charge associated with the
    write-off of costs associated with a natural gas gathering
    project. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in
    employee and other administrative costs associated with the
    transfer of gas supply operations from the pipeline, storage and
    other segment to our natural gas distribution segment effective
    January 1, 2007.

Miscellaneous
    income

Miscellaneous income increased to $8.2 million for the
    fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 from $6.9 million
    for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006. The increase
    was primarily attributable to $2.1 million received from
    leasing certain mineral interests coupled with an increase in
    interest income recorded in the pipeline, storage and other
    segment.

Interest
    charges

Interest charges allocated to the pipeline, storage and other
    segment for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007
    decreased to $6.1 million from $6.5 million for the
    fiscal year ended September 30, 2006.



The decrease was attributable to the use of updated allocation
    factors for fiscal 2007. These factors are reviewed and updated
    on an annual basis.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit
    facilities and commercial paper program generally provide the
    liquidity needed to fund our working capital, capital
    expenditures and other cash needs. Additionally, from time to
    time, we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital
    markets to fund our liquidity needs.

We normally access the commercial paper markets to finance our
    working capital needs and growth. However, recent adverse
    developments in global financial and credit markets, including
    the recent failure of a major investment bank and the bailout of
    or merger between several large financial institutions, have
    made it more difficult and more expensive for the Company to
    access the short-term capital markets, including the commercial
    paper market, to satisfy our liquidity requirements.

Consequently, as of September 30, 2008, we had borrowed
    $330.5 million directly under our five-year committed
    credit facility that backstops our commercial paper program to
    fund most of our working capital. Until recently, our five-year
    committed credit facility allowed us to borrow up to
    $600 million. However, one lender with a 5.55% share of the
    commitments has ceased funding under the facility. This has
    effectively limited the amount that we can borrow to
    approximately $567 million. The amounts borrowed under the
    credit facility have been primarily used to purchase large
    volumes of natural gas in preparation for the upcoming winter
    heating season. Although our natural gas marketing operations
    have not been impacted directly in a significant manner yet,
    continued disruptions in the capital markets could adversely
    affect the availability of the uncommitted demand credit
    facility on which such operations substantially relies to
    conduct its business. A significant reduction in such
    availability would mean that the Company would need to provide
    extra liquidity to support the activities of our natural gas
    marketing business and other nonregulated businesses. Our
    ability to provide extra liquidity is limited by the terms of
    our existing lending arrangements with AEH.

We have historically supplemented our commercial paper program
    with a short-term $300 million committed credit facility
    that must be renewed annually. There were no borrowings under
    this facility as of September 30, 2008. In October 2008, we
    replaced this facility upon its termination with a new facility
    that will allow borrowings up to $212.5 million and expires
    in October 2009. Additionally, as more fully described in
    Note 5, the borrowing costs under the new facility will be
    significantly higher than under the prior facility.

We believe the amounts available to us under our existing and
    new credit facilities coupled with operating cash flow will
    provide the necessary liquidity to fund our working capital
    needs, capital expenditures and other expenditures for fiscal
    year 2009.

Cash
    Flows

Our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a
    number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These
    include regulatory changes, the price for our services, the
    demand for our services, margin requirements resulting from
    significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks and
    other factors.

Cash
    flows from operating activities

Year-over-year changes in our operating cash flows primarily are
    attributable to changes in net income, working capital changes,
    particularly within our natural gas distribution segment
    resulting from the price of natural gas and the timing of
    customer collections, payments for natural gas purchases and
    deferred gas cost recoveries.

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, we generated
    operating cash flow of $370.9 million compared with
    $547.1 million in fiscal 2007 and $311.4 million in
    fiscal 2006. The significant factors impacting our operating
    cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below.



Fiscal
    Year ended September 30, 2008

Operating cash flows were $176.2 million lower in fiscal
    2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease primarily reflects an
    increase in cash required to collateralize risk management
    liabilities in our natural gas marketing segment, which reduced
    operating cash flow by $95.7 million and the unfavorable
    timing of gas cost collections in our natural gas distribution
    segment, which reduced operating cash flow by $92.6 million.

Fiscal
    Year ended September 30, 2007

Fiscal 2007 operating cash flows reflect the favorable timing of
    payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities, which
    increased operating cash flow by $107.6 million.
    Additionally, improved management of our deferred gas costs
    balances increased operating cash flow by $125.2 million.
    Finally, increased net income and other favorable working
    capital changes contributed to the increase in operating cash
    flow. Partially offsetting these increases in operating cash
    flow was a decrease in customer collections of
    $84.8 million due to the decrease in the price of natural
    gas during the fiscal year.

Fiscal
    Year ended September 30, 2006

Fiscal 2006 operating cash flows reflect the adverse impact of
    significantly higher natural gas prices. Year-over-year,
    unfavorable timing of payments for accounts payable and other
    accrued liabilities reduced operating cash flow by
    $523.0 million. Partially offsetting these outflows were
    higher customer collections ($245.1 million) and reduced
    payments for natural gas inventories ($102.1 million).
    Additionally, favorable movements in the market indices used to
    value our natural gas marketing segment risk management assets
    and liabilities reduced the amount that we were required to
    deposit in margin accounts and therefore favorably affected
    operating cash flow by $126.3 million.

Cash
    flows from investing activities

In recent fiscal years, a substantial portion of our cash
    resources has been used to fund acquisitions and growth
    projects, our ongoing construction program and improvements to
    information systems. Our ongoing construction program enables us
    to provide natural gas distribution services to our existing
    customer base, expand our natural gas distribution services into
    new markets, enhance the integrity of our pipelines and, more
    recently, expand our intrastate pipeline network. In executing
    our current rate strategy, we are directing discretionary
    capital spending to jurisdictions that permit us to earn a
    timely return on our investment. Currently, our Mid-Tex,
    Louisiana, Mississippi and West Texas natural gas distribution
    divisions and our Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division have
    rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their
    rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without
    being required to file a rate case.

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, we incurred
    $472.3 million for capital expenditures compared with
    $392.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30,
    2007 and $425.3 million for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2006. The increase in fiscal 2008 primarily
    reflects an increase in compliance spending and main
    replacements in our Mid-Tex Division, spending in the natural
    gas distribution segment for our new automated meter reading
    initiative and spending for two nonregulated growth projects.
    The decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 primarily
    reflects the absence of capital expenditures associated with our
    North Side Loop and other pipeline compression projects, which
    were completed during the fiscal 2006 third quarter.

Cash
    flows from financing activities

For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008 and 2006, our
    financing activities provided $98.1 million and
    $155.3 million in cash compared with cash of
    $159.3 million used for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2007. Our significant financing activities
    for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008, 2007 and
    2006 are summarized as follows:

•

During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008 and 2006,
    we increased our borrowings under our short-term facilities by
    $200.2 million and $237.6 million whereas during the
    fiscal year ended



September 30, 2007 we repaid a net $213.2 million
    under our short-term facilities. Net borrowings under our
    short-term facilities during fiscal 2008 and 2006 reflect the
    impact of seasonal natural gas purchases and the effect of
    higher natural gas prices.

•

We repaid $10.3 million of long-term debt during the fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2008, compared with
    $303.2 million during the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2007 and $3.3 million during the fiscal
    year ended September 30, 2006. The increased payments
    during fiscal 2007 reflect the repayment of our
    $300 million unsecured floating rate senior notes discussed
    below.

•

In June 2007, we issued $250 million of 6.35% Senior
    Notes due 2017. The effective interest rate of this offering,
    inclusive of all debt issue costs, was 6.45 percent. After
    giving effect to the settlement of our $100 million
    Treasury lock agreement in June 2007, the effective rate on
    these senior notes was reduced to 6.26 percent. We used the
    net proceeds of $247 million, together with
    $53 million of available cash, to repay our
    $300 million unsecured floating rate senior notes, which
    were redeemed on July 15, 2007.

•

In December 2006, we sold 6.3 million shares of common
    stock in an offering, including the underwriters’ exercise
    of their overallotment option of 0.8 million shares,
    generating net proceeds of approximately $192 million. The
    net proceeds from this issuance were used to reduce our
    short-term debt.

•

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, we paid
    $117.3 million in cash dividends compared with dividend
    payments of $111.7 million and $102.3 million for the
    fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006. The
    increase in dividends paid over the prior-year reflects the
    increase in our dividend rate from $1.28 per share during fiscal
    2007 to $1.30 per share during fiscal 2008, combined with a
    1.5 million increase in shares outstanding due to new share
    issuances under our various equity plans.

•

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 we issued
    1.0 million shares of common stock which generated net
    proceeds of $25.5 million. In addition, we granted
    0.5 million shares of common stock under our 1998 Long-Term
    Incentive Plan to directors, officers and other participants in
    the plan.

The following table shows the number of shares issued for the
    fiscal years ended September 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006:

Credit
    Facilities

As of September 30, 2008, we had three committed credit
    facilities totaling $918 million. These facilities included
    (1) a five-year $600 million unsecured facility
    expiring December 2011, (2) a $300 million unsecured

364-day

facility expiring October 2008, and (3) an $18 million
    unsecured facility expiring March 2009. However, one lender with
    a 5.55% share of the commitments under our $600 million and
    $300 million facilities has ceased funding under these
    facilities. Further, in October 2008, we replaced our
    $300 million facility at its termination with a new
    $212.5 million unsecured

364-day

facility. After giving effect to these changes, the amount
    available to us under our committed credit facilities was
    $797.2 million. As of September 30, 2008, we had no
    outstanding letters of credit under these facilities.



AEM has an uncommitted credit facility that can provide up to
    $580 million. As of September 30, 2008, the amount
    available to us under this credit facility, net of outstanding
    letters of credit, was $212.1 million. Borrowings under our
    uncommitted credit facilities are made on a

when-and-as-needed

basis at the discretion of the banks. Our credit capacity and
    the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the
    seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our short-term
    borrowing requirements, which are typically highest during
    colder winter months.

Our working capital needs can vary significantly due to changes
    in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the
    increased gas supplies required to meet customers’ needs
    during periods of cold weather. However, we believe these credit
    facilities, combined with our operating cash flows will be
    sufficient to fund our working capital needs, our fiscal 2009
    capital expenditure program and our common stock dividends.
    These facilities are described in further detail in Note 5
    to the consolidated financial statements.

Shelf
    Registration

On December 4, 2006, we filed a registration statement with
    the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue, from time
    to time, up to $900 million in new common stock

and/or

debt
    securities available for issuance. As of September 30,
    2008, we had approximately $450 million available for
    issuance under the registration statement. Due to certain
    restrictions imposed by one state regulatory commission on our
    ability to issue securities under the registration statement, we
    are permitted to issue a total of approximately
    $200 million of equity securities and $250 million of
    senior debt securities. In addition, due to restrictions imposed
    by another state regulatory commission, if the credit ratings on
    our senior unsecured debt were to fall below investment grade
    from either Standard & Poor’s Corporation (BBB-),
    Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. (Baa3) or Fitch Ratings,
    Ltd. (BBB-), our ability to issue any type of debt securities
    under the registration statement would be suspended until an
    investment grade rating from all three credit rating agencies
    was achieved.

Credit
    Ratings

Our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain
    short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the cost of
    such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating
    agencies consider a number of quantitative factors, including
    debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to
    outstanding debt, operating cash flow coverage of interest and
    pension liabilities and funding status. In addition, the rating
    agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our
    earnings over time, the quality of our management and business
    strategy, the risks associated with our regulated and
    nonregulated businesses and the regulatory structures that
    govern our rates in the states where we operate.

Our debt is rated by three rating agencies: Standard &
    Poor’s Corporation (S&P), Moody’s Investors
    Services, Inc. (Moody’s) and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (Fitch).
    Our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and
    are as follows:

S&P

Moody’s

Fitch

Unsecured senior long-term debt

BBB

Baa3

BBB+

Commercial paper

A-2

P-3

F-2

Currently, with respect to our unsecured senior long-term debt,
    S&P maintains its positive outlook and Fitch maintains its
    stable outlook. Moody’s recently reaffirmed its stable
    outlook. None of our ratings are currently under review.
    However, a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more
    limited access to the private and public credit markets as a
    result of the recent adverse global financial and credit
    conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings
    outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three
    credit rating agencies. This would mean even more limited access
    to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the
    costs of such borrowings.

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
    securities. The highest investment grade credit rating for
    S&P is AAA, Moody’s is Aaa and Fitch is AAA. The
    lowest investment grade credit rating for S&P is BBB-,
    Moody’s is Baa3 and Fitch is BBB-. Our credit ratings may
    be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies, and
    each rating should be evaluated independent of any other rating.
    There can be



no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given
    period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, or
    withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its judgment,
    circumstances so warrant.

Debt
    Covenants

We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of
    September 30, 2008. Our debt covenants are described in
    Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, including

    September 30, 2008 and 2007. The increase in the debt to
    capitalization ratio primarily reflects an increase in natural
    gas prices as of September 30, 2008 compared to the prior
    year. Our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically
    greater during the winter heating season as we make additional
    short-term borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our
    working capital requirements. We intend to maintain our
    capitalization ratio in a target range of 50 to 55 percent
    through cash flow generated from operations, continued issuance
    of new common stock under our Direct Stock Purchase Plan and
    Retirement Savings Plan and access to the equity capital markets.

AEM has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural
    gas under contracts indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed
    price contracts. At September 30, 2008, AEM was committed
    to purchase 55.8 Bcf within one year, 35.6 Bcf within
    one to three years and 0.5 Bcf after three years under
    indexed contracts. AEM was committed to purchase 1.5 Bcf
    within one year and less than 0.1 Bcf within one to three
    years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from $3.58
    to $13.20 per Mcf.



With the exception of our Mid-Tex Division, our natural gas
    distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several
    vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year.
    Commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under
    these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated
    prices. Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as
    necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the
    individual contract. Our Mid-Tex Division maintains long-term
    supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our
    customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase
    specified volumes at market prices. The estimated commitments
    under these contract terms as of September 30, 2008 are
    reflected in the table above.

Risk
    Management Activities

We conduct risk management activities through our natural gas
    distribution, natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and
    other segments. In our natural gas distribution segment, we use
    a combination of physical storage, fixed physical contracts and
    fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually
    large winter-period gas price increases. In our natural gas
    marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments, we manage
    our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock
    in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and
    financial instruments, including futures, over-the-counter and
    exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties.
    To the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual
    purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market
    indices we use in our hedges, we could experience
    ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting
    requirements for hedge accounting, resulting in the financial
    instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through
    earnings.

We record our financial instruments as a component of risk
    management assets and liabilities, which are classified as
    current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date
    of the underlying financial instrument. Substantially all of our
    financial instruments are valued using external market quotes
    and indices.

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits Obligations

Net
    Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit Costs

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, our total net
    periodic pension and other benefits costs was
    $47.9 million, compared with $48.6 million and
    $50.0 million for the fiscal years ended September 30,
    2007 and 2006. These costs relating to our natural gas
    distribution operations are recoverable through our gas
    distribution rates; however, a portion of these costs is
    capitalized into our gas distribution rate base. The remaining
    costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance
    expense.

Our total net periodic pension and other benefit costs remained
    relatively unchanged during the current-year period when
    compared with the prior-year period as the assumptions we made
    during our annual pension plan valuation completed June 30,
    2007 were consistent with the prior year. The discount rate used
    to compute the present value of a plan’s liabilities
    generally is based on rates of high-grade corporate bonds with
    maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits
    will be paid. At our June 30, 2007 measurement date, the
    interest rates were consistent with rates at our prior-year
    measurement date, which resulted in no change to our
    6.30 percent discount rate used to determine our fiscal
    2008 net periodic and post-retirement cost. In addition,
    our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant
    at 8.25 percent.

The decrease in total net periodic pension and other benefits
    costs during fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 primarily
    reflects changes in assumptions we made during our annual
    pension plan valuation completed June 30, 2006. The
    discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan’s
    liabilities generally is based on rates of high-grade corporate
    bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which
    the benefits will be paid. In the period leading up to our
    June 30, 2006 measurement date, these interest rates were
    increasing, which resulted in a 130 basis point increase in
    our discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2007 net
    periodic and post-retirement cost to 6.30 percent. This
    increase had the effect of decreasing the present value of our
    plan liabilities and associated expenses. This favorable impact
    was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of reducing the
    expected return on our pension plan assets by 25 basis
    points to 8.25 percent, which has the effect of increasing
    our pension and postretirement benefit costs.



Pension
    and Postretirement Plan Funding

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an
    amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to
    comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
    However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time
    to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to
    provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but
    also for those expected to be earned in the future.

During fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2006, we voluntarily contributed
    $2.3 million and $2.9 million to the Atmos Energy
    Corporation Retirement Plan for Mississippi Valley Gas Union
    Employees. These contributions achieved a desired level of
    funding for this plan for plan years 2007 and 2005. During
    fiscal 2007, we did not contribute to our pension plans.

We contributed $9.6 million, $11.8 million and
    $10.9 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the
    fiscal years ended September 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The
    contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs
    we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum
    funding required by state regulatory commissions.

Outlook
    for Fiscal 2009

Effective October 1, 2008, the Company adopted the
    requirement under SFAS 158,

Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
    amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R),

that the measurement date used to determine our projected
    benefit and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension
    and postretirement costs must correspond to a fiscal year end.
    In accordance with the transition rules, the fiscal 2009 expense
    will be based upon market conditions as of September 30,
    2008.

As of September 30, 2008, interest and corporate bond rates
    utilized to determine our discount rates, which will impact our
    fiscal 2009 net periodic pension and postretirement costs,
    were significantly higher than the interest and corporate bond
    rates as of June 30, 2007, the measurement date for our
    fiscal 2008 net periodic cost. Accordingly, we increased
    our discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2009 pension and
    benefit costs to 7.57%. We maintained the expected return on our
    pension plan assets at 8.25 percent, despite the recent
    decline in the financial markets as we believe this rate
    reflects the average rate of expected earnings on plan assets
    that will fund our projected benefit obligation. Although the
    fair value of our plan assets has declined as the financial
    markets have declined, the impact of this decline is mitigated
    by the fact that assets are smoothed for purposes of determining
    net periodic pension cost. Accordingly, asset gains and losses
    are recognized over time as a component of net periodic pension
    and benefit costs for our Pension Account Plan, our largest
    funded plan. Accordingly, we expect our fiscal 2009 pension and
    postretirement medical costs to be materially the same as in
    fiscal 2008.

Despite the recent decline in the fair value of the plans’
    assets, we were not required to make a minimum funding
    contribution to our pension plans during fiscal 2008. However,
    based upon market conditions subsequent to September 30,
    2008, the current funded position of the plans and the new
    funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act (PPA), we
    believe it is reasonably possible that we will be required to
    contribute to the plans in fiscal 2009. Further, we will
    consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is prudent
    to maintain certain PPA funding thresholds. However, we cannot
    anticipate with certainty whether such contributions will be
    made and the amount of such contributions. With respect to our
    postretirement medical plans, we anticipate contributing
    approximately $3.8 million during fiscal 2009.

The projected pension liability, future funding requirements and
    the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the Plan
    are subject to change, depending upon the actuarial value of
    plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations
    as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date. These amounts
    are impacted by actual investment returns, changes in interest
    rates and changes in the demographic composition of the
    participants in the plan.



RECENT
    ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

Recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows are described in
    Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and
    interest rates. Commodity price risk is the potential loss that
    we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a
    particular instrument or commodity. Interest-rate risk results
    from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue
    to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities.

We conduct risk management activities through both our natural
    gas distribution and natural gas marketing segments. In our
    natural gas distribution segment, we use a combination of
    physical storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed financial
    contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually
    large winter period gas price increases. In our natural gas
    marketing segment, we manage our exposure to the risk of natural
    gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a
    combination of storage and financial instruments including
    futures, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options and swap
    contracts with counterparties. Our risk management activities
    and related accounting treatment are described in further detail
    in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
    Additionally, our earnings are affected by changes in short-term
    interest rates as a result of our issuance of short-term
    commercial paper and our other short-term borrowings.

Commodity
    Price Risk

Natural
    gas distribution segment

We purchase natural gas for our natural gas distribution
    operations. Substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for
    natural gas distribution operations are recovered from our
    customers through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms.
    Therefore, our natural gas distribution operations have limited
    commodity price risk exposure.

Natural
    gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other
    segments

Our natural gas marketing segment is also exposed to risks
    associated with changes in the market price of natural gas. For
    our natural gas marketing segment, we use a sensitivity analysis
    to estimate commodity price risk. For purposes of this analysis,
    we estimate commodity price risk by applying a $0.50 change in
    the forward NYMEX price to our net open position (including
    existing storage and related financial contracts) at the end of
    each period. Based on AEH’s net open position (including
    existing storage and related financial contracts) at
    September 30, 2008 of 0.5 Bcf, a $0.50 change in the
    forward NYMEX price would have had a $0.3 million impact on
    our consolidated net income.

Changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to
    market our physical inventory (Gas Daily) and the related
    fair-value hedge (NYMEX) can result in volatility in our
    reported net income; but, over time, gains and losses on the
    sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses
    on the fair-value hedges. Based upon our net physical position
    at September 30, 2008 and assuming our hedges would still
    qualify as highly effective, a $0.50 change in the difference
    between the Gas Daily and NYMEX indices would impact our
    reported net income by approximately $2.8 million.

Additionally, these changes could cause us to recognize a risk
    management liability, which would require us to place cash into
    an escrow account to collateralize this liability position.
    This, in turn, would reduce the amount of cash we would have on
    hand to fund our working capital needs.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our earnings are exposed to changes in short-term interest rates
    associated with our short-term commercial paper program and
    other short-term borrowings. We use a sensitivity analysis to
    estimate our short-term



interest rate risk. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate
    our short- term interest rate risk as the difference between our
    actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest
    expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one
    percent increase in the interest rates associated with our
    short-term borrowings. Had interest rates associated with our
    short-term borrowings increased by an average of one percent,
    our interest expense would have increased by approximately
    $2.1 million during 2008.

We also assess market risk for our fixed rate long-term
    obligations. We estimate market risk for our long-term
    obligations as the potential increase in fair value resulting
    from a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates
    associated with these debt instruments. Fair value is estimated
    using a discounted cash flow analysis. Assuming this one percent
    hypothetical decrease, the fair value of our long-term
    obligations would have increased by approximately
    $144.2 million.

As of September 30, 2008, we were not engaged in other
    activities that would cause exposure to the risk of material
    earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or
    market commodity prices.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Atmos Energy Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Atmos Energy Corporation as of September 30, 2008 and 2007,
    and the related consolidated statements of income,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended September 30, 2008. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    Index at Item 8. These financial statements and schedule
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Atmos Energy Corporation at
    September 30, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results
    of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
    in the period ended September 30, 2008, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the financial statements taken as a
    whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Atmos Energy Corporation’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2008,
    based on criteria established in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
    November 18, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Nature of
    Business

Atmos Energy Corporation (“Atmos Energy” or the
    “Company”) and our subsidiaries are engaged primarily
    in the regulated natural gas distribution and transmission and
    storage businesses as well as certain other nonregulated
    businesses. Through our natural gas distribution business, we
    deliver natural gas through sales and transportation
    arrangements to approximately 3.2 million residential,
    commercial, public-authority and industrial customers through
    our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions in the
    service areas described below:

Denotes locations where we have more limited service areas.

In addition, we transport natural gas for others through our
    distribution system. Our natural gas distribution business is
    subject to federal and state regulation

and/or

regulation by local authorities in each of the states in which
    our natural gas distribution divisions operate. Our corporate
    headquarters and shared-services function are located in Dallas,
    Texas, and our customer support centers are located in Amarillo
    and Waco, Texas.

Our regulated transmission and storage business consists of the
    regulated operations of our Atmos Pipeline — Texas
    Division, a division of the Company. This division transports
    natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division, transports natural gas for
    third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in
    Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary to the
    pipeline industry including parking arrangements, lending and
    sales of inventory on hand. Parking arrangements provide
    short-term interruptible storage of gas on our pipeline. Lending
    services provide short-term interruptible loans of natural gas
    from our pipeline to meet market demands.

Our nonregulated businesses operate primarily in the Midwest and
    Southeast and include our natural gas marketing operations and
    our pipeline, storage and other operations. These businesses are
    operated through various wholly-owned subsidiaries of Atmos
    Energy Holdings, Inc. (AEH), which is wholly-owned by the
    Company and based in Houston, Texas.

Our natural gas marketing operations are managed by Atmos Energy
    Marketing, LLC (AEM), which is wholly-owned by AEH. AEM provides
    a variety of natural gas management services to municipalities,
    natural gas utility systems and industrial natural gas
    customers, primarily in the southeastern and midwestern states
    and to our Colorado-Kansas, Kentucky/Mid-States and Louisiana
    divisions. These services consist primarily of furnishing
    natural gas supplies at fixed and market-based prices, contract
    negotiation and administration, load forecasting, gas storage
    acquisition and management services, transportation services,
    peaking sales and balancing services, capacity utilization
    strategies and gas price hedging through the use of financial
    instruments.

Our pipeline, storage and other segment primarily consists of
    the operations of Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC (APS), Atmos
    Energy Services, LLC (AES) and Atmos Power Systems, Inc., each
    of which are wholly-owned by AEH. APS owns or has an interest in
    underground storage fields in Kentucky and Louisiana.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We use these storage facilities to reduce the need to contract
    for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during
    peak periods. Additionally, APS manages our natural gas
    gathering operations, which were limited in nature as of
    September 30, 2008. AES provides limited services to our
    natural gas distribution divisions, and the revenues AES
    receives are equal to the costs incurred to provide those
    services. Through Atmos Power Systems, Inc., we have constructed
    electric peaking power-generating plants and associated
    facilities and lease these plants through lease agreements that
    are accounted for as sales under generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of consolidation

— The accompanying
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Atmos
    Energy Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
    material intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

Use of estimates

— The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The most significant
    estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, legal and
    environmental accruals, insurance accruals, pension and
    postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes, asset
    retirement obligations, impairment of long-lived assets, risk
    management and trading activities and the valuation of goodwill,
    indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Regulation

— Our natural gas distribution and
    regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to
    regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of
    accounting records and various other matters by the respective
    regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. Our
    accounting policies recognize the financial effects of the
    ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various
    regulatory commissions. Regulated operations are accounted for
    in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 71,

Accounting for the Effects of Certain
    Types of Regulation

. This statement requires cost-based,
    rate-regulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect
    the authorized recovery of costs due to regulatory decisions in
    their financial statements. As a result, certain costs are
    permitted to be capitalized rather than expensed because they
    can be recovered through rates.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We record regulatory assets as a component of other current
    assets and deferred charges and other assets for costs that have
    been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates
    is considered probable. Regulatory liabilities are recorded
    either on the face of the balance sheet or as a component of
    current liabilities, deferred income taxes or deferred credits
    and other liabilities when it is probable that revenues will be
    reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through
    the ratemaking process. Significant regulatory assets and
    liabilities as of September 30, 2008 and 2007 included the
    following:

Currently authorized rates do not include a return on certain of
    our merger and integration costs; however, we recover the
    amortization of these costs. Merger and integration costs, net,
    are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated
    useful lives ranging up to 20 years. Environmental costs
    have been deferred to be included in future rate filings in
    accordance with rulings received from various state regulatory
    commissions. During the fiscal years ended September 30,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, we recognized $0.4 million,
    $0.3 million and $0.5 million in amortization expense
    related to these costs.

Revenue recognition

— Sales of natural gas to
    our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly
    basis; however, the billing cycle periods for certain classes of
    customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods
    used for financial reporting purposes. We follow the revenue
    accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution
    segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to
    customers, but not yet billed under the cycle billing method,
    are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to
    expense.

On occasion, we are permitted to implement new rates that have
    not been formally approved by our state regulatory commissions,
    which are subject to refund. As permitted by
    SFAS No. 71, we recognize this revenue and establish a
    reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our
    experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were
    implemented.

Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for
    increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through
    purchased gas adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas adjustment
    mechanisms provide gas utility



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an
    ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the
    utility company’s non-gas costs. There is no gross profit
    generated through purchased gas adjustments, but they provide a
    dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or decreases in our
    natural gas distribution segment’s gas costs. The effects
    of these purchased gas adjustment mechanisms are recorded as
    deferred gas costs on our balance sheet.

Operating revenues for our natural gas marketing segment and the
    associated carrying value of natural gas inventory (inclusive of
    storage costs) are recognized when we sell the gas and
    physically deliver it to our customers. Operating revenues
    include realized gains and losses arising from the settlement of
    financial instruments used in our natural gas marketing
    activities and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes
    in the fair value of natural gas inventory designated as a
    hedged item in a fair value hedge and the associated financial
    instruments. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, we included unrealized gains on open contracts of
    $25.5 million, $18.4 million and $17.2 million as
    a component of natural gas marketing revenues.

Operating revenues for our regulated transmission and storage
    and pipeline, storage and other segments are recognized in the
    period in which actual volumes are transported and storage
    services are provided.

Cash and cash equivalents

— We consider all
    highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
    months or less to be cash equivalents.

Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts

— Accounts receivable consist of natural gas sales
    to residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and other
    customers. For the majority of our receivables, we establish an
    allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collection
    experience. On certain other receivables where we are aware of a
    specific customer’s inability or reluctance to pay, we
    record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to
    reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably
    expect to collect. However, if circumstances change, our
    estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be
    affected. Circumstances which could affect our estimates
    include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, the
    level of natural gas prices, customer deposits and general
    economic conditions. Accounts are written off once they are
    deemed to be uncollectible.

Gas stored underground

— Our gas stored
    underground is comprised of natural gas injected into storage to
    support the winter season withdrawals for our natural gas
    distribution operations and natural gas held by our natural gas
    marketing and other nonregulated subsidiaries to conduct their
    operations. The average cost method is used for all our natural
    gas distribution divisions, except for certain jurisdictions in
    the Kentucky/Mid-States Division, where it is valued on the

first-in

first-out method basis, in accordance with regulatory
    requirements. The average gas cost method is also used for our
    regulated transmission and storage segment. Our natural gas
    marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments utilize the
    average cost method; however, most of this inventory is hedged
    and is therefore reported at fair value at the end of each
    month. Gas in storage that is retained as cushion gas to
    maintain reservoir pressure is classified as property, plant and
    equipment and is valued at cost.

Regulated property, plant and equipment

— Regulated property, plant and equipment is
    stated at original cost, net of contributions in aid of
    construction. The cost of additions includes direct construction
    costs, payroll related costs (taxes, pensions and other fringe
    benefits), administrative and general costs and an allowance for
    funds used during construction. The allowance for funds used
    during construction represents the estimated cost of funds used
    to finance the construction of major projects and are
    capitalized in the rate base for ratemaking purposes when the
    completed projects are placed in service. Interest expense of
    $2.9 million, $3.0 million and $3.6 million was
    capitalized in 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Major renewals, including replacement pipe, and betterments that
    are recoverable under our regulatory rate base are capitalized
    while the costs of maintenance and repairs that are not
    recoverable through rates are charged to expense as incurred.
    The costs of large projects are accumulated in construction in
    progress until



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the project is completed. When the project is completed, tested
    and placed in service, the balance is transferred to the
    regulated plant in service account included in the rate base and
    depreciation begins.

Regulated property, plant and equipment is depreciated at
    various rates on a straight-line basis. These rates are approved
    by our regulatory commissions and are comprised of two
    components: one based on average service life and one based on
    cost of removal. Accordingly, we recognize our cost of removal
    expense as a component of depreciation expense. The related cost
    of removal accrual is reflected as a regulatory liability on the
    consolidated balance sheet. At the time property, plant and
    equipment is retired, removal expenses less salvage, are charged
    to the regulatory cost of removal accrual. The composite
    depreciation rate was 3.7 percent, 3.9 percent and
    3.9 percent for the fiscal years ended September 30,
    2008, 2007 and 2006.

Nonregulated property, plant and equipment

— Nonregulated property, plant and equipment is
    stated at cost. Depreciation is generally computed on the
    straight-line method for financial reporting purposes based upon
    estimated useful lives ranging from three to 35 years.

Asset retirement obligations

— SFAS 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

and
    FIN 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
    Obligations

require that we record a liability at fair value
    for an asset retirement obligation when the legal obligation to
    retire the asset has been incurred with an offsetting increase
    to the carrying value of the related asset. Accretion of the
    asset retirement obligation due to the passage of time is
    recorded as an operating expense.

As of September 30, 2008 and 2007, we had recorded asset
    retirement obligations of $5.9 million and
    $9.0 million. Additionally, we recorded $1.3 million
    and $2.9 million of asset retirement costs as a component
    of property, plant and equipment that will be depreciated over
    the remaining life of the underlying associated assets.

We believe we have a legal obligation to retire our storage
    wells. However, we have not recognized an asset retirement
    obligation associated with our storage wells because there is
    not sufficient industry history to reasonably estimate the fair
    value of this obligation.

Impairment of long-lived assets

— We
    periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have
    occurred that indicate that other long-lived assets may not be
    recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant
    revision. When such events or circumstances are present, we
    assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining
    whether the carrying value will be recovered through the
    expected future cash flows. In the event the sum of the expected
    future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less
    than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss equal
    to the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair
    value is recorded.

During fiscal 2007, we recorded a $6.3 million charge
    associated with the write-off of approximately $3.0 million
    of costs related to a nonregulated natural gas gathering project
    and approximately $3.3 million of obsolete software costs.
    During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we determined that, as
    a result of declining irrigation sales primarily associated with
    our agricultural customers’ shift from gas-powered pumps to
    electric pumps, the West Texas Division’s irrigation assets
    would not be able to generate sufficient future cash flows from
    operations to recover the net investment in these assets.
    Therefore, we recorded a $22.9 million charge to impairment
    to write off the entire net book value.

Goodwill and intangible assets

— We annually
    evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second
    fiscal quarter or more frequently as impairment indicators
    arise. We use a present value technique based on discounted cash
    flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. These
    calculations are dependent on several subjective factors
    including the timing of future cash flows, future growth rates
    and the discount rate. An impairment charge is recognized if the
    carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its
    fair value.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives of
    10 years. These assets are reviewed for impairment as
    impairment indicators arise. When such events or circumstances
    are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets
    by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered
    through the expected future cash flows. In the event the sum of
    the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the
    asset is less than the carrying value of the asset, an
    impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset’s carrying
    value over its fair value is recorded. No impairment has been
    recognized.

Marketable securities

— As of
    September 30, 2008 and 2007, all of our marketable
    securities were classified as available-for-sale based upon the
    criteria of SFAS 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments
    in Debt and Equity Securities

. In accordance with that
    standard, these securities are reported at market value with
    unrealized gains and losses shown as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss). We regularly evaluate the
    performance of these investments on a fund by fund basis for
    impairment, taking into consideration the fund’s purpose,
    volatility and current returns. If a determination is made that
    a decline in fair value is other than temporary, the related
    fund is written down to its estimated fair value.

Financial instruments and hedging activities

— We currently use financial instruments to
    mitigate commodity price risk. Additionally, we periodically use
    financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. The
    objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have
    been tailored for our regulated and nonregulated businesses.
    Currently, we utilize financial instruments in our natural gas
    distribution, natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and
    other segments. The objectives and strategies for the use of
    financial instruments are discussed in Note 4.

We record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet
    at fair value as required by SFAS 133,

Accounting for
    Derivatives and Hedging Activities,

with changes in fair
    value ultimately recorded in the income statement. These
    financial instruments are reported as risk management assets and
    liabilities and are classified as current or noncurrent other
    assets or liabilities based upon the anticipated settlement date
    of the underlying financial instrument.

The timing of when changes in fair value of our financial
    instruments are recorded in the income statement depends on
    whether the financial instrument has been designated and
    qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory
    rulings require a different accounting treatment. Changes in
    fair value for financial instruments that do not meet one of
    these criteria are recognized in the income statement as they
    occur.

Financial
    Instruments Associated with Commodity Price Risk

In our natural gas distribution segment, the costs associated
    with and the gains and losses arising from the use of financial
    instruments to mitigate commodity price risk are included in our
    purchased gas adjustment mechanisms in accordance with
    regulatory requirements. Therefore, changes in the fair value of
    these financial instruments are initially recorded as a
    component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the
    consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas
    cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and
    recognized in revenue in accordance with SFAS 71.
    Accordingly, there is no earnings impact to our natural gas
    distribution segment as a result of the use of financial
    instruments.

In our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other
    segments, we have designated the natural gas inventory held by
    these operating segments as the hedged item in a fair-value
    hedge. This inventory is marked to market at the end of each
    month based on the Gas Daily index, with changes in fair value
    recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the
    period of change. The financial instruments associated with this
    natural gas inventory have been designated as fair-value hedges
    and are marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price
    with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or
    losses in revenue in the period of change. Changes in the
    spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the
    financial hedges designated against our physical inventory
    (NYMEX) and the market (spot) prices used to value our physical
    storage (Gas Daily) result in unrealized margins until the
    underlying physical gas is withdrawn and



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the related financial instruments are settled. Once the gas is
    withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled, the
    previously unrealized margins associated with these net
    positions are realized. We have elected to exclude this
    spot/forward differential for purposes of assessing the
    effectiveness of these fair-value hedges. Over time, we expect
    gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be
    offset by gains and losses on the fair-value hedges, resulting
    in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we
    anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction.

In our natural gas marketing segment, we have elected to treat
    fixed-price forward contracts to deliver natural gas as normal
    purchases and normal sales. As such, these deliveries are
    recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with our revenue
    recognition policy. Financial instruments used to mitigate the
    commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been
    designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and
    sales at indexed prices. Accordingly, unrealized gains and
    losses on these open financial instruments are recorded as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and are
    recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged
    volumes are sold. Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred,
    is reported as a component of revenue.

Gains and losses from hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in
    the income statement. Fair value and cash flow hedge
    ineffectiveness arising from natural gas market price
    differences between the locations of the hedged inventory and
    the delivery location specified in the financial instruments is
    referred to as basis ineffectiveness. Ineffectiveness arising
    from changes in the fair value of the fair value hedges due to
    changes in the difference between the spot price and the futures
    price, as well as the difference between the timing of the
    settlement of the futures and the valuation of the underlying
    physical commodity are referred to as timing ineffectiveness.

In our natural gas marketing segment, the following summarizes
    the gains and losses recognized in the income statement for the
    fiscal years ended September 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

In our pipeline, storage and other segment, actual hedge
    ineffectiveness arising from the timing of settlement of
    physical contracts and the settlement of the financial
    instruments resulted in a gain of approximately
    $5.4 million and $8.4 million for the fiscal years
    ended September 30, 2008 and 2007 and a loss of
    approximately $7.0 million for the fiscal year ended
    September 30, 2006.

Prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to
    determine the fair value of most of our financial instruments.
    Values derived from these sources reflect the market in which
    transactions involving these financial instruments are executed.
    We utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair
    value when external sources are not available. Values are
    adjusted accordingly to reflect the potential impact of an
    orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of
    time under then-current market conditions. We believe the market
    prices and models used to value these financial instruments
    represent the best information

available with respect to closing exchange and over-the-counter
    quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the
    contracts.

Fair-value estimates also consider the creditworthiness of our
    counterparties. Our counterparties consist primarily of
    financial institutions and major energy companies. This
    concentration of counterparties may materially impact our
    exposure to credit risk resulting from market, economic or
    regulatory conditions. Recent adverse developments in the global
    financial and credit markets have made it more difficult and
    more expensive for companies to access the short-term capital
    markets, which may negatively impact the creditworthiness of our
    counterparties. A continued tightening of the credit market
    could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform than
    expected and reserved. We seek to minimize counterparty credit
    risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and
    credit ratings and the use of collateral requirements under
    certain circumstances.

In our natural gas marketing segment, we also utilize master
    netting agreements with significant counterparties that allow us
    to offset gains and losses arising from financial instruments
    that may be settled in cash with gains and losses arising from
    financial instruments that may be settled with the physical
    commodity. Assets and liabilities from risk management
    activities, as well as accounts receivable and payable, reflect
    the master netting agreements in place.

In April 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued FSP

FIN 39-1,

Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39

. This FSP
    requires that, to the extent we utilize master netting
    agreements to offset gains and losses arising from financial
    instruments, we must include the fair value of cash collateral
    or the obligation to return cash in the amounts that have been
    netted. This FSP is applicable to the Company effective
    October 1, 2008 and early adoption is permitted. We have
    elected to adopt this FSP as of September 30, 2008. As a
    result of adopting this FSP, the Company netted
    $56.6 million of cash held in margin accounts into its
    current risk management assets and liabilities as of
    September 30, 2008. The adoption of this interpretation
    also required a reclassification as of September 30, 2007
    of a $1.7 million obligation to return cash from other
    current liabilities to risk management assets. This requirement
    to net this cash position against risk management assets and
    liabilities did not have a material impact on our financial
    position or working capital.

Financial
    Instruments Associated with Interest Rate Risk

We periodically manage interest rate risk, typically when we
    issue new or refinance existing long-term debt. Currently, we do
    not have any financial instruments in place to manage interest
    rate risk. However, in prior years, we entered into Treasury
    lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the
    interest cost associated with anticipated financings. We
    designated these Treasury lock agreements as a cash flow hedge
    of an anticipated transaction at the time the agreements were
    executed. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses associated
    with the Treasury lock agreements were recorded as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). When the
    Treasury locks were settled, the realized gain or loss was
    recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) and is being recognized as a component of interest
    expense over the life of the related financing arrangement.

Pension and other postretirement plans

—
    Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are
    determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous
    assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan
    assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed
    discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality
    data. Through fiscal 2008, we reviewed the estimates and
    assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan
    costs and liabilities annually based upon a June 30 measurement
    date. To comply with the new measurement date requirements of
    SFAS 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
    Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

, effective
    October 1, 2008, we changed our measurement date from June
    30 to our fiscal year end, September 30. This change is
    more fully discussed in Note 8. The assumed discount rate



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have
    the most significant impact on our pension costs and
    liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health care
    cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have
    the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and
    liabilities.

The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the
    actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement
    obligation and net pension and postretirement cost. When
    establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality
    corporate bond rates based on Moody’s Aa bond index,
    changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied
    discount rate that is derived from matching our projected
    benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate bond spot
    rate curve.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in
    calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the
    annual pension and postretirement plan cost. We estimate the
    expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond
    returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of
    active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset
    rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the
    guidance from our investment advisors in making a final
    determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the
    extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the
    course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate,
    that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan cost is
    not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases
    future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of
    approximately ten to twelve years.

We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in
    determining our annual postretirement net cost based upon our
    actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently
    enacted legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed
    rate of retirement is estimated based upon the annual review of
    our participant census information as of the measurement date.

Income taxes

— Income taxes are provided based
    on the liability method, which results in income tax assets and
    liabilities arising from temporary differences. Temporary
    differences are differences between the tax bases of assets and
    liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial
    statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in
    future years. The liability method requires the effect of tax
    rate changes on current and accumulated deferred income taxes to
    be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted.
    The liability method also requires that deferred tax assets be
    reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than
    not that the assets will be realized.

Stock-based compensation plans

— We maintain
    the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan that provides for the granting
    of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock
    appreciation rights, bonus stock, time-lapse restricted stock,
    performance-based restricted stock units and stock units to
    officers, division presidents and other key employees.
    Non-employee directors are also eligible to receive stock-based
    compensation under the 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The
    objectives of this plan include attracting and retaining the
    best personnel, providing for additional performance incentives
    and promoting our success by providing employees with the
    opportunity to acquire our common stock.

Accumulated other comprehensive loss

— Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of

Recent accounting pronouncements

— In March
    2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133

.
    SFAS 161 expands the disclosure requirements for derivative
    instruments and for hedging activities. This statement requires
    specific disclosures regarding how and why an entity uses
    derivative instruments; how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items are accounted for; and how derivative instruments
    and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows. Although the
    provisions of this standard will be effective for us beginning
    January 1, 2009, we adopted this standard effective
    October 1, 2008. Since SFAS 161 only requires
    additional disclosures concerning derivatives and hedging
    activities, this standard is not expected to have a material
    impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

. SFAS 157 defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and
    enhances disclosure on fair value measurements required under
    other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing
    guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair
    value. We will be required to apply the provisions of
    SFAS 157 beginning October 1, 2008. We believe this
    standard will not materially impact our financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows. However, it will
    significantly expand our disclosure concerning the fair value
    measurements reflected in our financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

. This new standard permits an entity to measure
    certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair
    value. The objective of the standard is to improve financial
    reporting by allowing entities to mitigate volatility in
    reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and
    liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge
    accounting provisions. Entities that elect the fair value option
    will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each
    subsequent reporting date. The fair value option may be elected
    on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis. The fair value option is irrevocable, unless a new
    election date occurs. The provisions of this standard will be
    effective October 1, 2008. We do not anticipate this
    standard will materially impact our financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

. SFAS 141(R)
    establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in
    a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial
    statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
    assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the
    acquisition date fair value. SFAS 141(R) significantly
    changes the accounting for business combinations in a number of
    areas, including the treatment of contingent consideration,
    preacquisition contingencies, transaction costs and
    restructuring costs. In addition, under SFAS 141(R),
    changes in an acquired entity’s deferred tax assets and
    uncertain tax positions after the measurement period will impact
    income tax expense. The provisions of this standard will apply
    to any acquisitions we may complete after October 1, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statement,
    an amendment of ARB No. 51

. SFAS 160 changes the
    accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be
    recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a
    component of equity. This new consolidation method significantly
    changes the accounting for transactions with minority interest
    holders. The provisions of the standard will be effective for us
    beginning October 1, 2009. This standard is not expected to
    have a material impact on our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Financial
    Instruments and Hedging Activities

We currently use financial instruments to mitigate commodity
    price risk. Additionally, we periodically utilize financial
    instruments to manage interest rate risk. The objectives and
    strategies for using financial instruments have been tailored to
    our regulated and nonregulated businesses. Currently, we utilize
    financial instruments in our natural gas distribution, natural
    gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

However, our pipeline, storage and other segment uses financial
    instruments acquired from AEM on the same terms that AEM
    received from an independent counterparty. On a consolidated
    basis, these financial instruments are reported in the natural
    gas marketing segment.

As discussed in Note 2, we report our financial instruments
    as risk management assets and liabilities, each of which is
    classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated
    settlement date of the underlying financial instrument. The

Regulated
    Commodity Risk Management Activities

Although our purchased gas adjustment mechanisms essentially
    insulate our natural gas distribution segment from commodity
    price risk, our natural gas distribution customers are exposed
    to the effect of volatile natural gas prices. We manage this
    exposure through a combination of physical storage, fixed-price
    forward contracts and financial instruments, primarily

over-the-counter

swap and option contracts, in an effort to minimize the impact
    of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the
    winter heating season.

Our natural gas distribution gas supply department is
    responsible for executing this segment’s commodity risk
    management activities in conformity with regulatory
    requirements. In jurisdictions where we are permitted to
    mitigate commodity price risk through financial instruments, the
    relevant regulatory authorities may establish the level of
    heating season gas purchases that can be hedged. If the
    regulatory authority does not establish this level, we seek to
    hedge between 25 and 50 percent of anticipated heating
    season gas purchases using financial instruments. For the

2007-2008

heating season, we hedged approximately 45 percent of our
    anticipated winter flowing gas requirements at a weighted
    average cost of approximately $7.61 per Mcf.

We currently do not manage commodity price risk with financial
    instruments in our regulated transmission and storage segment.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Nonregulated
    Commodity Risk Management Activities

Our natural gas marketing segment, through AEM, aggregates and
    purchases gas supply, arranges transportation

and/or

storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers
    at competitive prices. To facilitate this process, we utilize
    proprietary and customer-owned transportation and storage assets
    to provide the various services our customers request.

We also perform asset optimization activities in both our
    natural gas marketing segment and pipeline, storage and other
    segment. Through asset optimization activities, we seek to
    maximize the economic value associated with the storage and
    transportation capacity we own or control. We attempt to meet
    this objective by engaging in natural gas storage transactions
    in which we seek to find and profit from the pricing differences
    that occur over time. We purchase physical natural gas and then
    sell financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a
    gross profit margin. We also seek to participate in transactions
    in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation
    costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers by
    identifying the lowest cost alternative within the natural gas
    supplies, transportation and markets to which we have access.
    Through the use of transportation and storage services and
    financial instruments, we also seek to capture gross profit
    margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences that exist
    in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that
    occur over time. Over time, gains and losses on the sale of
    storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the
    financial instruments, resulting in the realization of the
    economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we
    structured the original transaction.

As a result of these activities, our nonregulated operations are
    exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of
    natural gas. We manage our exposure to such risks through a
    combination of physical storage and financial instruments,
    including futures,

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with
    counterparties. Future contracts provide the right to buy or
    sell the commodity at a fixed price in the future. Option
    contracts provide the right, but not the requirement, to buy or
    sell the commodity at a fixed price. Swap contracts require
    receipt of payment for the commodity based on the difference
    between a fixed price and the market price on the settlement
    date.

We use financial instruments, designated as cash flow hedges of
    anticipated purchases and sales at index prices, to mitigate the
    commodity price risk in our natural gas marketing segment
    associated with deliveries under fixed-priced forward contracts
    to deliver gas to customers, and we use financial instruments,
    designated as fair value hedges, to hedge our natural gas
    inventory used in our asset optimization activities in our
    natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments.

Also, in our natural gas marketing segment, we use storage swaps
    and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage
    opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the
    original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural
    gas inventory, basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic
    value of our fixed price and storage books and various

over-the-counter

and exchange-traded options. These financial instruments have
    not been designated as hedges pursuant to FASB Statement
    No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities

.

Our nonregulated risk management activities are controlled
    through various risk management policies and procedures. Our
    Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for our
    nonregulated risk management limits and policies. Our risk
    management committee, comprised of corporate and business unit
    officers, is responsible for establishing and enforcing our
    nonregulated risk management policies and procedures.

Under our risk management policies, we seek to match our
    financial instrument positions to our physical storage positions
    as well as our expected current and future sales and purchase
    obligations to maintain no open positions at the end of each
    trading day. The determination of our net open position as of
    any day, however, requires us to make assumptions as to future
    circumstances, including the use of gas by our customers in
    relation to our anticipated storage and market positions.
    Because the price risk associated with any net open position at
    the end of each day may increase if the assumptions are not
    realized, we review these assumptions



ATMOS

as part of our daily monitoring activities. We can also be
    affected by intraday fluctuations of gas prices, since the price
    of natural gas purchased or sold for future delivery earlier in
    the day may not be hedged until later in the day. At times,
    limited net open positions related to our existing and
    anticipated commitments may occur. At the close of business on
    September 30, 2008, AEH had a net open position (including
    existing storage) of 0.5 Bcf.

Interest
    Rate Risk Management Activities

Currently, we are not managing interest rate risk with financial
    instruments. However, in prior years, we periodically managed
    interest rate risk by entering into Treasury lock agreements to
    fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated
    with anticipated financings.

In fiscal 2004, we entered into four Treasury lock agreements to
    fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost of
    financing associated with the-then anticipated issuance of
    $875 million of long-term debt issued in October 2004 in
    connection with the permanent financing for our TXU Gas
    acquisition. These Treasury lock agreements were settled in
    October 2004 with a net $43.8 million payment to the
    counterparties.

In March 2007, we entered into a Treasury lock agreement to fix
    the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated
    with $100 million of our $250 million
    6.35% Senior Notes issued in June 2007. This Treasury lock
    agreement was settled in June 2007, which resulted in the
    receipt of $2.9 million from the counterparties.

The gains and losses realized upon settlement were recorded as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and
    are being recognized as a component of interest expense over the
    life of the associated notes from the date of settlement.

Short-term
    debt

At September 30, 2008, we had $350.5 million of
    short-term debt outstanding comprised of $330.5 million
    outstanding under our bank credit facilities and
    $20.0 million outstanding under our commercial paper

program. At September 30, 2007 we had $150.6 million
    outstanding under our commercial paper program. There were no
    amounts outstanding under our bank credit facilities at
    September 30, 2007. As of September 30, 2008, our
    commercial paper had maturities of less than three months, with
    an interest rate of 3.35 percent.

Shelf
    registration

On December 4, 2006, we filed a registration statement with
    the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue, from time
    to time, up to $900 million in new common stock

and/or

debt
    securities available for issuance. As of September 30,
    2008, we had approximately $450 million of availability
    remaining under the registration statement. Due to certain
    restrictions placed by one state regulatory commission on our
    ability to issue securities under the registration statement, we
    are permitted to issue a total of approximately
    $200 million of equity securities and $250 million of
    senior debt securities. In addition, due to restrictions imposed
    by another state regulatory commission, if the credit ratings on
    our senior unsecured debt were to fall below investment grade
    from either Standard & Poor’s Corporation (BBB-),
    Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. (Baa3) or Fitch Ratings,
    Ltd. (BBB-), our ability to issue any type of debt securities
    under the registration statement would be suspended until we
    received an investment grade rating from all of the three credit
    rating agencies.

Credit
    facilities

We maintain both committed and uncommitted credit facilities.
    Borrowings under our uncommitted credit facilities are made on a

when-and-as-needed

basis at the discretion of the bank. Our credit capacity and the
    amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal
    nature of the natural gas business and our short-term borrowing
    requirements, which are typically highest during colder winter
    months. Our working capital needs can vary significantly due to
    changes in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the
    increased gas supplies required to meet customers’ needs
    during periods of cold weather.

Committed
    credit facilities

As of September 30, 2008, we had three committed revolving
    credit facilities totaling $918 million. The first facility
    is a five-year unsecured facility, expiring December 2011, that
    bears interest at a base rate or at the LIBOR rate for the
    applicable interest period, plus from 0.30 percent to
    0.75 percent, based on the Company’s credit ratings.
    This credit facility serves as a backup liquidity facility for
    our commercial paper program. At the time this credit facility
    was established, the limit on borrowings under the facility was
    $600 million. However, in September 2008, the limit on
    borrowings was effectively reduced to approximately
    $567 million after one lender with a 5.55% share of the
    commitments ceased funding under the facility. At
    September 30, 2008, there was $216.2 million available
    under the credit facility.

The second facility is a $300 million unsecured

364-day

facility expiring October 2008, that bears interest at a base
    rate or the LIBOR rate for the applicable interest period, plus
    from 0.30 percent to 0.75 percent, based on the
    Company’s credit ratings. In September 2008, the limit on
    borrowings was reduced to approximately $283 million after
    one lender with a 5.55% share of the commitments ceased funding
    under the facility. At September 30, 2008, there were no
    borrowings under this facility. In October 2008, this facility
    was replaced upon its termination by a $212.5 million
    unsecured

364-day

facility that bears interest at a base rate or the LIBOR rate
    for the applicable interest period, plus from 1.25 percent
    to 2.50 percent, based on the Company’s credit ratings.

The third facility is an $18 million unsecured facility
    that bears interest at a daily negotiated rate, generally based
    on the Federal Funds rate plus a variable margin. This facility
    expired on March 31, 2008 and was renewed effective
    April 1, 2008 for one year with no material changes to the
    terms and pricing. At September 30, 2008, there were no
    borrowings under this facility.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The availability of funds under our credit facilities is subject
    to conditions specified in the respective credit agreements, all
    of which we currently satisfy. These conditions include our
    compliance with financial covenants and the continued accuracy
    of representations and warranties contained in these agreements.
    We are required by the financial covenants in our revolving
    credit facilities to maintain, at the end of each fiscal
    quarter, a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no
    greater than 70 percent. At September 30, 2008, our
    total-debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, as defined, was
    57 percent. In addition, both the interest margin over the
    Eurodollar rate and the fee that we pay on unused amounts under
    each of our revolving credit facilities are subject to
    adjustment depending upon our credit ratings. The revolving
    credit facilities each contain the same limitation with respect
    to our total-debt to-total capitalization ratio.

Uncommitted
    credit facilities

AEM has a $580 million uncommitted demand working capital
    credit facility. On March 31, 2008, AEM and the
    participating banks amended the facility, primarily to extend it
    to March 31, 2009. In addition, the amendment removed the
    financial covenant relating to the amount of cumulative losses
    that could be incurred by AEM and its subsidiaries over a
    specific period of time and included provisions permitting the
    participating banks, or their affiliates, to participate in
    physical commodity transactions with AEM.

Borrowings under the credit facility can be made either as
    revolving loans or offshore rate loans. Revolving loan
    borrowings will bear interest at a floating rate equal to a base
    rate defined as the higher of (i) 0.50 percent per
    annum above the Federal Funds rate or (ii) the
    lender’s prime rate plus 0.25 percent. Offshore rate
    loan borrowings will bear interest at a floating rate equal to a
    base rate based upon LIBOR for the applicable interest period
    plus an applicable margin, ranging from 1.25 percent to
    1.625 percent per annum, depending on the excess tangible
    net worth of AEM, as defined in the credit facility. Borrowings
    drawn down under letters of credit issued by the banks will bear
    interest at a floating rate equal to the base rate, as defined
    above, plus an applicable margin, which will range from
    1.00 percent to 1.875 percent per annum, depending on
    the excess tangible net worth of AEM and whether the letters of
    credit are swap-related standby letters of credit.

AEM is required by the financial covenants in the credit
    facility not to exceed a maximum ratio of total liabilities to
    tangible net worth of 5 to 1. At September 30, 2008,
    AEM’s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth, as
    defined, was 1.58 to 1. Additionally, AEM must maintain minimum
    levels of net working capital ranging from $20 million to
    $120 million and a minimum tangible net worth ranging from
    $21 million to $121 million. As defined in the
    financial covenants, at September 30, 2008, AEM’s net
    working capital was $218.8 million and its tangible net
    worth was $232.5 million.

At September 30, 2008, there were no borrowings outstanding
    under this credit facility. However, at September 30, 2008,
    AEM letters of credit totaling $87.9 million had been
    issued under the facility, which reduced the amount available by
    a corresponding amount. The amount available under this credit
    facility is also limited by various covenants, including
    covenants based on working capital. Under the most restrictive
    covenant, the amount available to AEM under this credit facility
    was $212.1 million at September 30, 2008. This line of
    credit is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of
    AEM and is guaranteed by AEH.

The Company has a $200 million intercompany uncommitted
    revolving credit facility with AEH. This facility bears interest
    at the lower of (i) the one-month LIBOR rate plus
    0.20 percent or (ii) the marginal borrowing rate
    available to the Company on any such date under its commercial
    paper program. Applicable state regulatory commissions have
    approved this facility through December 31, 2008. The
    Company has applied for renewal of these approvals through
    December 31, 2009. At September 30, 2008, there were
    no borrowings outstanding under this facility.

AEH has a $200 million intercompany uncommitted demand
    credit facility with the Company, which bears interest at the
    rate of AEM’s $580 million uncommitted demand working
    capital credit facility plus

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

0.75 percent. Applicable state regulatory commissions have
    approved this facility through December 31, 2008. The
    Company has applied for renewal of these approvals through
    December 31, 2009. At September 30, 2008, there was
    $35.1 million outstanding under this facility.

In addition, to supplement its $580 million credit
    facility, AEM has a $200 million intercompany uncommitted
    demand credit facility with AEH, which bears interest at the
    rate of AEM’s $580 million uncommitted demand working
    capital credit facility plus 0.75 percent. Any outstanding
    amounts under this facility are subordinated to AEM’s
    $580 million uncommitted demand credit facility. At
    September 30, 2008, there was $6.5 million outstanding
    under this facility.

Debt
    Covenants

In addition to the covenants described above, our Series P
    First Mortgage Bonds contained provisions that allowed us to
    prepay the outstanding balance in whole at any time, subject to
    a prepayment premium. The First Mortgage Bonds provided for
    certain cash flow requirements and restrictions on the
    incurrence of additional indebtedness, sales of assets and
    payments of dividends. In May 2008, we redeemed our
    Series P First Mortgage Bonds which were scheduled to
    mature in November 2013. Since the bonds have been redeemed and
    the related indenture has been discharged, the debt covenants
    described above no longer apply.

We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of
    September 30, 2008. If we do not comply with our debt
    covenants, we may be required to repay our outstanding balances
    on demand, provide additional collateral or take other
    corrective actions. Our public debt indentures relating to our
    senior notes and debentures, as well as our revolving credit
    agreements, each contain a default provision that is triggered
    if outstanding indebtedness arising out of any other credit
    agreements in amounts ranging from in excess of $15 million
    to in excess of $100 million becomes due by acceleration or
    is not paid at maturity. In addition, AEM’s credit
    agreement contains a cross-default provision whereby AEM would
    be in default if it defaults on other indebtedness, as defined,
    by at least $250 thousand in the aggregate. Additionally, this
    agreement contains a provision that would limit the amount of
    credit available if the Company were downgraded below an
    S&P rating of BBB and a Moody’s rating of Baa2.

Except as described above, we have no triggering events in our
    debt instruments that are tied to changes in specified credit
    ratings or stock price, nor have we entered into any
    transactions that would require us to issue equity based on our
    credit rating or other triggering events.

Based on the borrowing rates currently available to us for debt
    with similar terms and remaining average maturities, the fair
    value of long-term debt at September 30, 2008 and 2007 is
    estimated, using discounted cash flow analysis, to be
    $1,955.5 million and $2,026.6 million.

Maturities of long-term debt at September 30, 2008 were as

Shareholders’

Stock
    Issuances

During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008, 2007 and
    2006 we issued 1,488,146, 7,587,021 and 1,200,115 shares of
    common stock.

On December 13, 2006, we completed the public offering of
    6,325,000 shares of our common stock including the
    underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option of
    825,000 shares. The offering was priced at $31.50 per share
    and generated net proceeds of approximately $192 million.
    We used the net proceeds from this offering to reduce short-term
    debt.

Shareholder
    Rights Plan

In November 1997, our Board of Directors declared a dividend
    distribution of one right for each outstanding share of our
    common stock to shareholders of record at the close of business
    on May 10, 1998, the description and terms of which were
    set forth in a rights agreement between us and the rights agent
    dated May 10, 1998. From that time until the expiration of
    the rights agreement on May 10, 2008, when all rights
    terminated, each share of common stock we issued included a
    right that entitled the holder to purchase from us a one-tenth
    share of our common stock at a purchase price of $8.00 per
    share, subject to adjustment.

Stock and
    Other Compensation Plans

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

Total stock-based compensation expense was $14.0 million,
    $11.9 million and $10.2 million for the fiscal years
    ended September 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, primarily related
    to restricted stock costs.

    Long-Term Incentive Plan

In August 1998, the Board of Directors approved and adopted the
    1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which became effective in
    October 1998 after approval by our shareholders. The LTIP is a
    comprehensive, long-term incentive compensation plan providing
    for discretionary awards of incentive stock options,
    non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, bonus
    stock, time-lapse restricted stock, performance-based restricted
    stock units and stock units to certain employees and
    non-employee directors of the Company and our subsidiaries. The
    objectives of this plan include attracting and retaining the
    best personnel, providing for additional performance incentives
    and promoting our success by providing employees with the
    opportunity to acquire common stock. We are authorized to grant
    awards for up to a maximum of 6.5 million shares of common
    stock under this plan subject to certain adjustment provisions.
    As of September 30, 2008, non-qualified stock options,
    bonus stock, time-lapse restricted stock, performance-based
    restricted stock units and stock units had been issued under
    this plan, and 2,122,776 shares were available for future
    issuance. The option price of the stock options issued under
    this plan is equal to the market price of our stock at the date
    of grant. These stock options expire 10 years from the date
    of the grant and vest annually over a service period ranging
    from one to three years. However, no stock options have been
    granted under this plan since fiscal 2003, except for a limited
    number of options that were converted from bonuses paid under
    our Annual Incentive Plan, the last of which occurred in fiscal
    2006.

Restricted
    Stock Plans

As noted above, the LTIP provides for discretionary awards of
    restricted stock to help attract, retain and reward employees of
    Atmos Energy and its subsidiaries. Certain of these awards vest
    based upon the passage of time and other awards vest based upon
    the passage of time and the achievement of specified performance
    targets. The associated expense is recognized ratably over the
    vesting period. The following summarizes

    Plans

Direct
    Stock Purchase Plan

We maintain a Direct Stock Purchase Plan, open to all investors,
    which allows participants to have all or part of their cash
    dividends paid quarterly in additional shares of our common
    stock. The minimum initial investment required to join the plan
    is $1,250. Direct Stock Purchase Plan participants may purchase
    additional shares of our common stock as often as weekly with
    voluntary cash payments of at least $25, up to an annual maximum
    of $100,000.

Outside
    Directors

Stock-For-Fee

Plan

In November 1994, the Board adopted the Outside Directors

Stock-for-Fee

Plan which was approved by our shareholders in February 1995 and
    was amended and restated in November 1997. The plan permits
    non-employee directors to receive all or part of their annual
    retainer and meeting fees in stock rather than in cash.

Equity
    Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
    Directors

In November 1998, the Board of Directors adopted the Equity
    Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
    Directors which was approved by our shareholders in February
    1999. This plan amended the Atmos Energy Corporation Deferred
    Compensation Plan for Outside Directors adopted by the Company
    in May 1990 and replaced the pension payable under our
    Retirement Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The plan provides
    non-employee directors of Atmos Energy with the opportunity to
    defer receipt, until retirement, of compensation for services
    rendered to the Company, invest deferred compensation into
    either a cash account or a stock account and to receive an
    annual grant of share units for each year of service on the
    Board.

Other
    Discretionary Compensation Plans

We adopted the Variable Pay Plan in fiscal 1999 for our
    regulated segments’ employees to give each employee an
    opportunity to share in our financial success based on the
    achievement of key performance measures considered critical to
    achieving business objectives for a given year and has minimum
    and maximum thresholds. The plan must meet the minimum threshold
    in order for the plan to be funded and distributed to employees.
    These performance measures may include earnings growth
    objectives, improved cash flow objectives or crucial customer
    satisfaction and safety results. We monitor progress towards the
    achievement of the performance measures throughout the year and
    record accruals based upon the expected payout using the best
    estimates available at the time the accrual is recorded. During
    the last several fiscal years, we have used earnings per share
    as our sole performance measure.

We adopted our Annual Incentive Plan in October 2001 to give the
    employees in our nonregulated segments an opportunity to share
    in the success of the nonregulated operations. The plan is based
    upon the net earnings of the nonregulated operations and has
    minimum and maximum thresholds. The plan must meet the minimum
    threshold in order for the plan to be funded and distributed to
    employees. We monitor the progress toward the achievement of the
    thresholds throughout the year and record accruals based upon
    the expected payout using the best estimates available at the
    time the accrual is recorded.

Retirement
    and Post-Retirement Employee Benefit Plans

We have both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit
    plans that together cover substantially all of our employees. We
    also maintain post-retirement plans that provide health care
    benefits to retired employees. Finally, we sponsor defined
    contribution plans which cover substantially all employees.
    These plans are discussed in further detail below.



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Effective September 30, 2007, we adopted the provisions of
    SFAS 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
    Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

. The new
    standard made a significant change to the existing rules by
    requiring recognition in the balance sheet of the overfunded or
    underfunded positions of defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement plans, along with a corresponding noncash,
    after-tax adjustment to stockholders’ equity.

Additionally, this standard required that our measurement date
    correspond to the fiscal year end balance sheet date by as late
    as fiscal 2009 for the Company. Effective October 1, 2008,
    the Company adopted the measurement date requirement of
    SFAS 158 using the remeasurement approach. Under this
    approach, the Company remeasured its projected benefit
    obligation, fair value of plan assets and its fiscal
    2009 net periodic cost. In accordance with the transition
    rules of SFAS 158, the impact of changing the measurement
    date will decrease retained earnings by $7.8 million, net
    of tax, decrease the unrecognized actuarial loss by
    $9.0 million and increase our postretirement liabilities by
    $3.5 million as of October 1, 2008.

As a rate regulated entity, we generally recover our pension
    costs in our rates over a period of up to 15 years.
    Therefore, the decrease in the unrecognized actuarial loss that
    would have been recorded as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive loss, net of tax, will be recorded as a reduction
    to a regulatory asset as a component of deferred charges and
    other assets in fiscal 2009. The change in the measurement date
    will not materially impact the level of net periodic pension
    cost we will record in fiscal 2009.

The amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic
    pension cost that have been recorded as regulatory assets are as
    follows:

    Benefit Plans

Employee
    Pension Plans

As of September 30, 2008, we maintained two defined benefit
    plans: the Atmos Energy Corporation Pension Account Plan (the
    Plan) and the Atmos Energy Corporation Retirement Plan for
    Mississippi Valley Gas Union Employees (the Union Plan)
    (collectively referred to as the Plans). The assets of the Plans
    are held within the Atmos Energy Corporation Master Retirement
    Trust (the Master Trust).

The Plan is a cash balance pension plan, that was established
    effective January 1999 and covers substantially all employees of
    Atmos Energy’s regulated operations. Opening account
    balances were established for participants as of January 1999
    equal to the present value of their respective accrued benefits
    under the pension plans which were previously in effect as of
    December 31, 1998. The Plan credits an allocation to



ATMOS
    ENERGY CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

each participant’s account at the end of each year
    according to a formula based on the participant’s age,
    service and total pay (excluding incentive pay).

The Plan also provides for an additional annual allocation based
    upon a participant’s age as of January 1, 1999 for
    those participants who were participants in the prior pension
    plans. The Plan will credit this additional allocation each year
    through December 31, 2008. In addition, at the end of each
    year, a participant’s account will be credited with
    interest on the employee’s prior year account balance. A
    special grandfather benefit also applies through
    December 31, 2008, for participants who were at least
    age 50 as of January 1, 1999, and who were
    participants in one of the prior plans on December 31,
    1998. Participants fully vest in their account balances after
    three years of service and may choose to receive their account
    balances as a lump sum or an annuity.

The Union Plan is a defined benefit plan that covers
    substantially all full-time union employees in our Mississippi
    Division. Under this plan, benefits are based upon years of
    benefit service and average final earnings. Participants vest in
    the plan after five years and will receive their benefit in an
    annuity.

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an
    amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, including the funding
    requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA).
    However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time
    to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to
    provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but
    also for those expected to be earned in the future.

During fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2006, we voluntarily contributed
    $2.3 million and $2.9 million to the Union Plan. These
    contributions achieved a desired level of funding for this plan
    for the plan years 2007 and 2005. During fiscal 2007, we did not
    make any contributions to the Plans. However, based upon market
    conditions subsequent to September 30, 2008, the current
    funded position of the plans and the new funding requirements
    under the PPA, we believe it is reasonably possible that we will
    be required to contribute to the Plans in fiscal 2009. Further,
    we will consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is
    prudent to maintain certain PPA funding thresholds. However, we
    cannot anticipate with certainty whether such contributions will
    be made and the amount of such contributions.

We manage the Master Trust’s assets with the objective of
    achieving a rate of return net of inflation of approximately
    four percent per year. We make investment decisions and evaluate
    performance on a medium term horizon of at least three to five
    years. We also consider our current financial status when making
    recommendations and decisions regarding the Master Trust’s
    assets. Finally, we strive to ensure the Master Trust’s
    assets are appropriately invested to maintain an acceptable
    level of risk and meet the Master Trust’s long-term asset
    investment policy adopted by the Board of Directors.

To achieve these objectives, we invest the Master Trust’s
    assets in equity securities, fixed income securities, interests
    in commingled pension trust funds, other investment assets and
    cash and cash equivalents. Investments in equity securities are
    diversified among the market’s various subsectors in an
    effort to diversify risk and maximize returns. Fixed income
    securities are invested in investment grade securities. Cash
    equivalents are invested in securities that either are short
    term (less than 180 days) or readily convertible to cash
    with modest risk.

At September 30, 2008 and 2007, the Plan held
    1,169,700 shares of our common stock, which represented
    10.2 percent and 8.5 percent of total Master Trust
    assets. These shares generated dividend income for the Plan of
    approximately $1.5 million during fiscal 2008 and 2007.

Our employee pension plan expenses and liabilities are
    determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous
    assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan
    assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets and
    assumed discount rates and demographic data. We review the
    estimates and assumptions underlying our employee pension plans
    annually based upon a June 30 measurement date. The development
    of our assumptions is fully described in our significant
    accounting policies in Note 2. The actuarial assumptions
    used to determine the pension liability for the Plans were
    determined as of June 30, 2008 and 2007 and the actuarial
    assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension cost for
    the Plans were determined as of June 30, 2007, 2006 and

Supplemental
    Executive Benefits Plans

We have a nonqualified Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan
    which provides additional pension, disability and death benefits
    to our officers, division presidents and certain other employees
    of the Company who were employed on or before August 12,
    1998. In addition, in August 1998, we adopted the Supplemental
    Executive Retirement Plan (formerly known as the
    Performance-Based Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan), which
    covers all employees who become officers or division presidents
    after August 12, 1998 or any other employees selected by
    our Board of Directors at its discretion.

Similar to our employee pension plans, we review the estimates
    and assumptions underlying our supplemental executive benefit
    plans annually based upon a June 30 measurement date using the
    same techniques as our employee pension plans. The actuarial
    assumptions used to determine the pension liability for the

Postretirement
    Benefits

We sponsor the Retiree Medical Plan for Retirees and Disabled
    Employees of Atmos Energy Corporation (the Atmos Retiree Medical
    Plan). This plan provides medical and prescription drug
    protection to all qualified participants based on their date of
    retirement. The Atmos Retiree Medical Plan provides different
    levels of benefits depending on the level of coverage chosen by
    the participants and the terms of predecessor plans; however, we
    generally pay 80 percent of the projected net claims and
    administrative costs and participants pay the remaining
    20 percent of this cost.

Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an
    amount in accordance with the requirements of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. However, additional
    voluntary contributions are made annually as considered
    necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for
    benefits attributed to service to date but also for those
    expected to be earned in the future. We expect to contribute
    $12.7 million to our postretirement benefits plan during
    fiscal 2009.

We maintain a formal investment policy with respect to the
    assets in our postretirement benefits plan to ensure the assets
    funding the postretirement benefit plan are appropriately
    invested to maintain an acceptable level of risk. We also
    consider our current financial status when making
    recommendations and decisions regarding the postretirement
    benefits plan.

We are currently recovering other postretirement benefits costs

    postretirement benefits costs have been specifically addressed
    in rate orders in each jurisdiction served by our
    Kentucky/Mid-States Division and our Mississippi Division or
    have been included in a rate case and not disallowed. Management
    believes that accrual accounting in accordance with

Defined
    Contribution Plans

As of September 30, 2008, we maintained three defined
    contribution benefit plans: the Atmos Energy Corporation
    Retirement Savings Plan and Trust (the Retirement Savings Plan),
    the Atmos Energy Corporation Savings Plan for MVG Union
    Employees (the Union 401K Plan) and the Atmos Energy Marketing,
    LLC 401K Profit-Sharing Plan (the AEM 401K Profit-Sharing Plan).

The Retirement Savings Plan covers substantially all employees
    in our regulated operations and is subject to the provisions of
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Effective
    January 1, 2007, employees automatically became
    participants of the Retirement Savings Plan on the date of
    employment. Participants may elect a salary reduction ranging
    from a minimum of one percent up to a maximum of 65 percent
    of eligible compensation, as defined by the Plan, not to exceed
    the maximum allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. New
    participants are automatically enrolled in the Plan at a salary
    reduction amount of four percent of eligible compensation, from
    which they may opt out. We match 100 percent of a
    participant’s contributions, limited to four percent of the
    participant’s salary, in our common stock. However,
    participants have the option to immediately transfer this
    matching contribution into other funds held within the plan.
    Participants are eligible to receive matching contributions
    after completing one year of service. Participants are also
    permitted to take out loans against their accounts subject to
    certain restrictions.

The Union 401K Plan covers substantially all Mississippi
    Division employees who are members of the International Chemical
    Workers Union Council, United Food and Commercial Workers Union
    International (the Union) and is subject to the provisions of
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees of
    the Union automatically become participants of the Union 401K
    plan on the date of union membership. We match 50 percent
    of a participant’s contribution in cash, limited to six
    percent of the participant’s eligible contribution.
    Participants are also permitted to take out loans against their
    accounts subject to certain restrictions.

Matching contributions to the Retirement Savings Plan and the
    Union 401K Plan are expensed as incurred and amounted to
    $8.9 million, $8.3 million, and $7.0 million for
    fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006. The Board of Directors may
    also approve discretionary contributions, subject to the
    provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and applicable
    regulations of the Internal Revenue Service. No discretionary
    contributions were made for fiscal years 2008, 2007 or 2006. At
    September 30, 2008 and 2007, the Retirement Savings Plan
    held 3.4 percent and 3.1 percent of our outstanding
    common stock.

The AEM 401K Profit-Sharing Plan covers substantially all AEM
    employees and is subject to the provisions of
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Participants
    may elect a salary reduction ranging from a minimum of one
    percent up to a maximum of 65 percent of eligible
    compensation, as defined by the Plan, not to exceed the maximum
    allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company may elect
    to make safe harbor contributions up to three percent of the
    employee’s salary which vest immediately. The Company may
    also make discretionary profit sharing contributions to the AEM
    401K Profit-Sharing Plan. Participants become fully vested in
    the discretionary profit-sharing contributions after three years
    of service. Participants are also permitted to take out loans
    against their accounts subject to certain restrictions.
    Discretionary contributions to the AEM 401K Profit-Sharing Plan

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation
    of FASB Statement No. 109

. FIN 48 addresses the
    determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be
    claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial
    statements. Under FIN 48, the Company may recognize the tax
    benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more
    likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on
    examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
    merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the
    financial statements from such a position should be measured
    based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty
    percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the
    taxing authorities. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
    derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income
    taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased
    disclosures.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on October 1,
    2007. As a result of adopting FIN 48, we determined that we
    had $6.1 million of liabilities associated with uncertain
    tax positions. Of this amount, $0.5 million was recognized
    as a result of adopting FIN 48 with an offsetting reduction
    to retained earnings.

Prior to October 1, 2007, the $5.6 million liability
    previously recorded for uncertain tax positions was reflected on
    the consolidated balance sheet as a component of deferred income
    taxes. As a result of adopting FIN 48, we recorded a
    $3.7 million liability as a component of other current
    liabilities and $2.4 million as a component of deferred
    credits and other liabilities, with offsetting decreases to the
    deferred income tax liability.

As of September 30, 2008, we had recorded liabilities
    associated with uncertain tax positions totaling
    $6.7 million. The realization of all of these tax benefits
    would reduce our income tax expense by approximately
    $6.7 million.

    benefits for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 (in

    related to penalty and interest expenses during the fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2008.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction
    as well as in various states where we have operations. We have

Commitments

Litigation

Colorado-Kansas
    Division

We are a defendant in a lawsuit originally filed by Quinque
    Operating Company, Tom Boles and Robert Ditto in September
    1999 in the District Court of Stevens County, Kansas against
    more than 200 companies in the natural gas industry. The
    plaintiffs, who purport to represent a class of royalty owners,
    allege that the defendants have underpaid royalties on gas taken
    from wells situated on non-federal and non-Indian lands in
    Kansas, predicated upon allegations that the defendants’
    gas measurements were inaccurate. The plaintiffs have not
    specifically alleged an amount of damages. We are also a
    defendant, along with over 50 other companies in the natural gas
    industry, in another proposed class action lawsuit filed in the
    same court by Will Price, Tom Boles and The Cooper Clarke
    Foundation in May 2003 involving similar allegations. We believe
    that the plaintiffs’ claims are lacking in merit and we
    intend to vigorously defend these actions. While the results
    cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the final outcome
    of such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We
    are also a defendant in another lawsuit entitled

In Re
    Natural Gas Royalties Qui Tam Litigation

, involving similar
    allegations filed in June 1997 in the United States District
    Court for the District of Colorado, which was later transferred
    to the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming,
    where it was consolidated with approximately 50

additional lawsuits in October 1999. In October 2006, the
    District Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss
    this lawsuit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The
    plaintiffs have appealed this dismissal order on which oral
    arguments were heard by the United States Court of Appeals for
    the Tenth Circuit in September 2008. The appeal has yet to be
    ruled on by the Tenth Circuit.

We are a party to other litigation and claims that have arisen
    in the ordinary course of our business. While the results of
    such litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty,
    we believe the final outcome of such litigation and claims will
    not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,

    plant sites in Johnson City and Bristol, Tennessee, Keokuk,
    Iowa, Hannibal, Missouri, and Owensboro, Kentucky, which were
    used to supply gas prior to the availability of natural gas. The
    gas manufacturing process resulted in certain byproducts and
    residual materials, including coal tar. The manufacturing
    process used by our predecessors was an acceptable and
    satisfactory process at the time such operations were being
    conducted. Under current environmental protection laws and
    regulations, we may be responsible for response actions with
    respect to such materials if response actions are necessary. We
    have taken removal actions with respect to the sites that have
    been approved by the applicable regulatory authorities in
    Tennessee, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky and the United States
    Environmental Protection Agency.

We are a party to other environmental matters and claims that
    have arisen in the ordinary course of our business. While the
    ultimate results of response actions to these environmental
    matters and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we
    believe the final outcome of such response actions will not have
    a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations or cash flows because we believe that the
    expenditures related to such response actions will either be
    recovered through rates, shared with other parties or are
    adequately covered by insurance.

Purchase
    Commitments

AEM has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural
    gas under contracts indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed
    price contracts. At September 30, 2008, AEM was committed
    to purchase 55.8 Bcf within one year, 35.6 Bcf within
    one to three years and 0.5 Bcf after three years under
    indexed contracts. AEM is committed to purchase 1.5 Bcf
    within one year and less than 0.1 Bcf within one to three
    years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from $3.58
    to $13.20 per Mcf. Purchases under these contracts totaled
    $3,075.0 million, $2,065.1 million and
    $2,124.3 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Our natural gas distribution divisions, except for our Mid-Tex
    Division, maintain supply contracts with several vendors that
    generally cover a period of up to one year. Commitments for
    estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts
    on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices.
    Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as
    necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the
    individual contract.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Our Mid-Tex Division maintains long-term supply contracts to
    ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service
    area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market
    and fixed prices. The estimated commitments under these
    contracts as of September 30, 2008 are as follows (in

Other
    Contingencies

In December 2007, the Company received data requests from the
    Division of Investigations of the Office of Enforcement of the
    Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the
    “Commission”) in connection with its investigation
    into possible violations of the Commission’s posting and
    competitive bidding regulations for pre-arranged released firm
    capacity on natural gas pipelines. We have responded timely to
    two sets of data requests received from the Commission and are
    fully cooperating with the Commission during this investigation.

Subsequent to responding to the second set of data requests, the
    Commission agreed to allow the Company to conduct our own
    internal investigation into compliance with the
    Commission’s rules, and we will provide the results of this
    internal investigation to the Commission upon its completion. We
    currently are unable to predict the final outcome of this
    investigation or the potential impact it could have on our
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On September 1, 2008, a Texas Railroad Commission rule,
    which is applicable to all natural gas distribution companies
    operating in Texas, became effective concerning the replacement
    of known compression couplings at pre-bent gas meter risers.
    Compliance with this rule should not have a significant impact
    on our West Texas Division but will require us to spend
    significant amounts of capital in our Mid-Tex Division. The
    completion date required by the Railroad Commission of Texas for
    the replacement of known compression couplings at pre-bent gas
    meter risers is November 2009 and the Mid-Tex Division is on
    target to meet this requirement. Compliance with this rule will
    require us to expend significant amounts of capital but these
    prudent and mandatory expenditures should be recoverable through
    our rates in the Mid-Tex Division. As a result, we anticipate no
    long-term adverse impact on our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

    into agreements to either lease or sell these plants. We
    completed a sales-type lease transaction for one distributed
    electric generation plant in 2001 and a second sales-type lease
    transaction in 2003. In connection with these lease
    transactions, as of September 30, 2008 and 2007, we had
    receivables of $13.8 million and $16.4 million and
    recognized income of $1.3 million, $1.5 million and

We have entered into non-cancelable operating leases for office
    and warehouse space used in our operations. The remaining lease
    terms range from one to 20 years and generally provide for
    the payment of taxes, insurance and maintenance by the lessee.
    Renewal options exist for certain of these leases. We have also
    entered into capital leases for division offices and operating
    facilities. Property, plant and equipment included amounts for
    capital leases of $1.3 million and $4.6 million at
    September 30, 2008 and 2007. Accumulated depreciation for
    these capital leases totaled $0.7 million and
    $3.2 million at September 30, 2008 and 2007.
    Depreciation expense for these assets is included in
    consolidated depreciation expense on the consolidated statement

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to us if a customer
    fails to perform its contractual obligations. We engage in
    transactions for the purchase and sale of products and services
    with major companies in the energy industry and with industrial,
    commercial, residential and municipal energy consumers. These
    transactions principally occur in the southern and midwestern
    regions of the United States. We believe that this geographic
    concentration does not contribute significantly to our overall
    exposure to credit risk. Credit risk associated



ATMOS

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

with trade accounts receivable for the natural gas distribution
    segment is mitigated by the large number of individual customers
    and diversity in our customer base. The credit risk for our
    other segments is not significant.

Customer diversification also helps mitigate AEM’s exposure
    to credit risk. AEM maintains credit policies with respect to
    its counterparties that it believes minimizes overall credit
    risk. Where appropriate, such policies include the evaluation of
    a prospective counterparty’s financial condition,
    collateral requirements, primarily consisting of letters of
    credit, and the use of standardized agreements that facilitate
    the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty.
    AEM also monitors the financial condition of existing
    counterparties on an ongoing basis. Customers not meeting
    minimum standards are required to provide adequate assurance of
    financial performance.

AEM maintains a provision for credit losses based upon factors
    surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends,
    consideration of the current credit environment and other
    information. We believe, based on our credit policies and our
    provisions for credit losses as of September 30, 2008, that
    our financial position, results of operations and cash flows
    will not be materially affected as a result of nonperformance by
    any single counterparty.

AEM’s estimated credit exposure is monitored in terms of
    the percentage of its customers, including affiliate customers,
    that are rated as investment grade versus non-investment grade.
    Credit exposure is defined as the total of (1) accounts
    receivable, (2) delivered, but unbilled physical sales and

(3) mark-to-market

exposure for sales and purchases. Investment grade
    determinations are set internally by AEM’s credit
    department, but are primarily based on external ratings provided
    by Moody’s Investors Service Inc. (Moody’s)

and/or

Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P). For
    non-rated entities, the default rating for municipalities is
    investment grade, while the default rating for non-guaranteed
    industrials and commercials is non-investment grade. The
    following table shows the percentages related to the investment
    ratings as of September 30, 2008 and 2007.

The following table presents our financial instrument
    counterparty credit exposure by operating segment based upon the

    represent assets as of September 30, 2008. Investment grade
    counterparties have minimum credit ratings of BBB-, assigned by
    S&P; or Baa3, assigned by Moody’s. Non-investment
    grade counterparties are composed of counterparties that are
    below investment grade or that have not been assigned an
    internal investment grade rating due to the short-term nature of
    the contracts associated with that counterparty. This category
    is composed of numerous smaller counterparties, none of which is
    individually significant.

Segment
    Information

Atmos Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries are engaged
    primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution,
    transmission and storage business as well as other nonregulated
    businesses. We distribute natural gas through sales and
    transportation arrangements to approximately 3.2 million
    residential, commercial, public authority and industrial
    customers through our six regulated natural gas distribution
    divisions, which cover service areas located in 12 states.
    In addition, we transport natural gas for others through our
    distribution system.

Through our nonregulated businesses, we primarily provide
    natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities,
    other local distribution companies and industrial customers
    primarily in the Midwest and Southeast. Additionally, we provide
    natural gas transportation and storage services to certain of
    our natural gas distribution operations and to third parties.

We operate the Company through the following four segments:

•

The

natural gas distribution segment,

which includes our
    regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations.

•

The

regulated transmission and storage segment,

which
    includes the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the
    Atmos Pipeline — Texas Division.

•

The

natural gas marketing segment,

which includes a
    variety of nonregulated natural gas management services.

•

The

pipeline, storage and other segment,

which includes
    our nonregulated natural gas transmission and storage services.

Our determination of reportable segments considers the strategic
    operating units under which we manage sales of various products
    and services to customers in differing regulatory environments.
    Although our natural gas distribution segment operations are
    geographically dispersed, they are reported as a single segment
    as each natural gas distribution division has similar economic
    characteristics. The accounting policies of the segments are the
    same as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies. We evaluate performance based on net income or loss of
    the respective operating units. Interest expense is allocated
    pro rata to each segment based upon our net investment in each
    segment. Income taxes are allocated to each segment as if each
    segment’s taxes were calculated on a separate return basis.

    in the weighted average shares outstanding used in computing
    such amounts. Our businesses are seasonal due to weather
    conditions in our service areas. For further information on its

Controls
    and Procedures.

Management’s
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer, of the
    effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act).
    Based on this evaluation, the Company’s principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective
    as of September 30, 2008 to provide reasonable assurance
    that information required to be disclosed by us, including our
    consolidated entities, in the reports that we file or submit
    under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and
    reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s
    rules and forms, including a reasonable level of assurance that
    such information is accumulated and communicated to our
    management, including our principal executive and principal
    financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f),

in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the
    participation of our management, including our principal
    executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting based on the framework in

Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework

issued by COSO and applicable
    Securities and Exchange Commission rules, our management
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of September 30, 2008, in providing reasonable
    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
    the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Ernst & Young LLP has issued its report on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Atmos Energy Corporation

We have audited Atmos Energy Corporation’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of September 30, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Atmos Energy
    Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Atmos Energy Corporation maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of September 30, 2008, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2008 and
    2007, and the related statements of income, stockholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended September 30, 2008 of Atmos Energy Corporation and
    our report dated November 18, 2008 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

Rule 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Act) during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
    ended September 30, 2008 that have materially affected, or
