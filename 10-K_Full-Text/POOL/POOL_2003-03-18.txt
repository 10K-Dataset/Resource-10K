General

SCP Pool Corporation (the

Company

, which may be referred to as

,

us

or

) is the world’s leading
wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies and related equipment. We are the
largest company in the young swimming pool industry, and we believe we add
considerable value to the swimming pool supply chain because we purchase products
from a large number of manufacturers and then distribute these goods to a highly
fragmented customer base on terms that are more favorable than these customers
could obtain on their own. Our customers are swimming pool remodelers and builders,
retail swimming pool stores and swimming pool repair and service companies.

As of February 28, 2003, we operated
187 service centers in North America and Europe.

Net sales by geographic region were

Our  annual  reports  on Form  10-K,
 quarterly  reports  on Form 10-Q,  definitive  proxy  statements  pursuant  to Regulation 14A,

Growth Strategy

We promote the growth of the
swimming pool industry through various  advertising and promotional  programs  intended
to  raise  consumer  awareness  regarding  the  benefits  and  affordability  of pool
 ownership,  the  ease of pool maintenance and the many ways to enjoy a pool beyond
 swimming.  These programs include media  advertising,  website development and
billboards.  Our  www.backyardescape.com  website serves as one of our vehicles to
educate consumers about swimming pools and lead prospective pool owners to our customers.

Growth Strategy
(continued)

We promote the growth of our
customers’  businesses  through a comprehensive  support program which includes a wide
range  of   promotional   tools   and   advertising   support.   The   industry
  promotional   programs   and  the www.backyardescape.com  website  generate new
business  leads for our  customers.  We help our customers to further expand their
 businesses by offering  uniquely  tailored  programs  designed to assist our builder
 customers,  our service  customers  and  our  retail  customers.  These  programs
 include  tools  such as  personalized  websites, brochures  to  facilitate  the sales
 process  and  professional  and  business  development  training.  For retail customers,
we also assist with everything from store layout and design to site selection.

These efforts have allowed us to
grow  internally  through  increases in base business  sales of 10% in 2002 and 3% in
2001.  Same store sales  increased 10%, 2% and 11% in 2002,  2001 and 2000,
 respectively.  Additionally,  since 1998,  we have opened 29 new  service  centers,  and
we expect to continue to open five to ten new service  centers each year.  Externally,
 since 1998 we have grown through the successful  completion of 13 acquisitions
 consisting of 84  service  centers  (net of  service  center  closings  and
 consolidations).  We intend to pursue  additional strategic  acquisitions  which will
allow us to further  penetrate  existing markets and expand into new geographic markets.
In August 2002, we acquired Fort Wayne Pools, Inc., a distributor and manufacturer of swimming pool equipment,
parts and supplies operating through 22 service centers in 16 states.
 For a complete discussion of recent acquisitions, read Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Operating Strategy

We operate two national
 distribution  networks:  the SCP network and the Superior  Pool  Products  (SPP)
 network. The SCP network consists of 132 service centers.
The SPP network was established in July 2000 and is composed of the following:

19 service  centers  acquired  in our  acquisition  of the  assets of  Superior  Pool  Products,  Inc.  in
     July 2000 (SPP or the Superior Acquisition);

26 of the  service  centers  acquired  in our  acquisition  of the assets of the pool  division  of Hughes
     Supply, Inc. in January 2001 (Hughes or the Hughes Acquisition);

eight service  centers  acquired in our  acquisition of Fort Wayne Pools,  Inc. in August 2002 (Fort Wayne
     or the Fort Wayne Acquisition); and,

two newly opened services centers.

We adopted this strategy of
operating two distinct national distribution networks primarily for two reasons:

To offer our customers a choice of different  distributors  featuring  distinctive  product selections and
     relationships with manufacturers; and

To increase the level of customer service provided by the service centers in each network by promoting
a healthy competition between the two networks.

Products

We offer more than  60,000  national
 brand and private  label  products.  We believe  that our  selection  of pool equipment
and supplies,  chemicals,  replacement parts and complementary  products is the most
comprehensive in the swimming pool industry.  The products we sell can be categorized as
follows:

Maintenance products such as chemicals, supplies and pool accessories;

Repair and replacement parts for cleaners, filters, heaters, pumps and lights;

Packaged pool kits including walls,  liners,  bracing,  filters,  heaters,  pumps and lights for in-ground
     and above-ground pools; and

Pool equipment and materials for new pool construction and the remodeling of existing pools.

Additionally,  since 1999 we have
significantly  increased the breadth of complementary products we offer including
building  materials,  electrical  supplies,  toys and games,  water  features such as
 fountains,  and spas and spa accessories.

Maintenance  products and repair and
replacement parts are  non-discretionary  in nature,  meaning that these items must be
purchased by pool owners to maintain  existing  swimming pools.  These products,
 together with replacement equipment, account for approximately 80% of our net sales.

Customers and Marketing

We serve more than 45,000
 customers,  none of which  account  for more than 1% of our sales.  We  primarily  serve
three types of customers:

swimming pool remodelers and builders;

retail swimming pool stores; and

swimming pool repair and service companies.

We conduct our operations  through
187 service  centers in North America and Europe.  Our primary  markets  include
California, Florida, Texas and Arizona.

We employ an  enthusiastic  sales
force dedicated to developing and  strengthening  customer  relationships.  As of February 28, 2003,
 a sales  force  of 213  outside  salespersons  and 192  service  center  managers
 conduct  our principal selling activities.

As discussed  above,  our primary
 marketing  activities aim to raise the profile of the swimming pool industry and educate
consumers on the ease of maintenance and affordability of a swimming pool.

Distribution

Our service  centers are located
near customer  concentrations,  typically in  industrial,  commercial or mixed-use zones.
 Customers  may pick up products at any service  center  location,  or  products  may be
 delivered  via our trucks or third party carriers.

Distribution
(continued)

Our service centers maintain
 well-stocked  inventories to meet customers’  immediate  needs. We utilize  warehouse
management technology to optimize receiving, inventory control, picking, packing and
shipping functions.

In addition,  we operate four
centralized  shipping  locations that redistribute parts and other products purchased in
bulk quantities.

Purchasing and
Suppliers

We initiated a preferred  vendor
program in 1999 which  encourages our service centers to purchase  products from a
smaller  number of  vendors.  The  service  centers  are also  encouraged  to ensure
 accurate  pricing and greater pricing  discipline at the point of sale.  These practices
have resulted in improved  margins at the service center level.

We enjoy good  relationships  with
our suppliers who  generally  offer  competitive  pricing,  return  policies and
promotional  allowances.  It is customary in the swimming  pool supply  industry for
 manufacturers  to  seasonally offer extended  payment terms to qualifying  purchasers
such as SCP. These terms are typically  available to us for pre-season or early season
purchases.

We regularly  evaluate supplier
 relationships and consider  alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost, service and
quality  standards.  Our largest suppliers are Pentair  Corporation,  Hayward Pool
Products,  Inc. and Bio-Lab, Inc. (a subsidiary  of Great Lakes  Chemicals,  Inc.);
 these  suppliers  provided  approximately  13%, 10% and 7%, respectively, of the
products we sold in 2002.

Competition

We are the leading  wholesale
 distributor in the swimming pool supply industry.  We face intense  competition from
many regional and local  distributors in our markets and to a lesser extent,  mass-market
 retailers and large pool supply  distributor/retailers.  Some geographic markets we
serve,  particularly  higher density markets in Florida, California,  Texas and Arizona,
 are more  competitive  than others.  Barriers to entry in the swimming pool supply
industry are relatively low.

We compete  with other  distributors
 for rights to  distribute  brand-name  products.  If we lose or are unable to obtain
these  rights,  we might be materially  and adversely  affected.  We believe that the breadth of our operations
allow us to compete favorably for such distribution rights.

We believe that the principal
competitive factors in swimming pool supply distribution are:

the breadth and availability of products offered;

the quality and level of customer service;

the breadth and depth of sales and marketing programs;

competitive product pricing; and,

consistency and stability of business relationships with customers.

We believe that we generally compete
favorably with respect to each of these factors.

Seasonality and Weather

See Item 7,  “Management’s
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of Operations - Seasonality

Environmental, Health
and Safety Regulations

Our  business  is subject to
 regulation  under local fire codes and  federal,  state and local  environmental  and
health and safety requirements including:

the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act;

the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act; and,

the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA).

Most of these  requirements  govern
the packaging,  labeling,  handling,  transportation,  storage and sale of pool
chemicals.  We store  chemicals  at each of our  service  centers.  The  storage  of
these  chemicals  is  strictly regulated  by local fire codes.  In  addition,  we sell
 algaecides  that are  regulated  as  pesticides  under the Federal  Insecticide,
 Fungicide and  Rodenticide  Act and state  pesticide  laws.  These laws primarily
 relate to labeling and annual registration.

While we make considerable efforts
to ensure that we operate in substantial  compliance with environmental,  health and
safety  requirements,  we cannot assure you that we will not be  determined  to be out of
 compliance  with, or liable  under,  such  requirements.  Such an  instance  of
 noncompliance  or  liability  could be  harmful  to our operating results.

Employees

As of  February 28, 2003,  we
employed  approximately  2,300 people on a full-time basis. We consider our relations
with our employees to be good.

Intellectual Property

We maintain  both  domestic and
foreign  registered  trademarks  primarily  for our private  label  products and we
intend to  maintain  the  trademark  registrations  important  to our  business
 operations.  We also own rights to several Internet domain names.

Item 2.

Properties

We lease  our  administrative
 headquarters,  which  consists  of  approximately  33,000  square  feet of an office
building in  Covington,  Louisiana.  We own three  service  centers in  Florida.  All of
our other  properties  are leased for terms that  expire  between  2003 and 2017.  In
addition to minimum  rental  payments,  which are set at competitive rates, certain
leases require  reimbursement for taxes,  maintenance and insurance.  Most of our leases
contain renewal options, some of which involve rent increases.

Our  service  centers  range in size
from  approximately  3,000  square  feet to 54,000  square feet and consist of warehouse,
 counter,  display and office space.  We also operate four  centralized  shipping
 locations  ranging in size from 22,000 square feet to 30,000 square feet.

During
the years 1998 to 2002, we successfully  completed 13 acquisitions  consisting of 115
service  centers,      of which 31 were closed or consolidated into existing service
centers.  For further discussion, see Item 1.

In
1999, we adopted Statement of Position 98-5,

Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up
Activities,

and recognized a cumulative effect adjustment, net of a tax benefit, of
$544,000, or a net loss of $0.02 per share.

(3)

In
the fourth quarter of 2002, we began to calculate base business sales growth by excluding
the following  service  centers from the  calculation for      15 months:  (i) service
centers  acquired within the past 15 months,  (ii) service centers  consolidated  with
     acquired  locations  and (iii) new  service  centers  opened in new  markets  within
the past 15 months.  Base      business sales growth was not calculated in 2000, 1999 or
1998.    Base business sales growth is consistent with measures used by other
distributors.

We
calculate same store sales growth by excluding the following  service  centers from the
 calculation for 15      months:  (i) service centers acquired or opened within the past
15 months,  (ii) service centers  consolidated      with acquired  locations and (iii)
service centers that experience  market disruption due to their location in      the
immediate market area of those mentioned above.

We sell everything  necessary to

including:

swimming pool equipment;

parts and supplies;

chemicals;

cleaners;

packaged pools;

liners;

filters;

heaters;

lights;

repair parts; and

other equipment.

Since 1999, we have significantly
increased our offering of complementary products including:

water features such as fountains; and

spas and spa accessories.

We primarily sell to:

swimming pool remodelers and builders;

retail swimming pool stores; and

swimming pool repair and service companies.

These customers are mostly small,
 family owned businesses with relatively limited capital  resources.  We maintain a
strict credit policy.  In the past, losses from customer receivables have been within our
expectations.

Our expenses consist primarily of
(i) the cost of products  purchased for resale and (ii) operating  expenses which are
 primarily  related to labor,  occupancy,  freight,  marketing,  and selling and
 administrative  expenses.  We compete for business and may respond to  competitive
 pressures by lowering  prices in order to maintain our market share.  Such measures
adversely affect our gross margins and operating results.

General (continued)

We calculate same store growth by
excluding the following service centers from the calculation for 15 months:

New service centers opened within the past 15 months;

Service centers acquired within the past 15 months;

Service centers consolidated with acquired service centers; and

Service centers that experience  market  disruption due to their location in the immediate market areas of
     those mentioned above.

Beginning in the fourth  quarter of
2002, we began  calculating  our “base  business”  growth,  which is consistent with
measures used by other  distributors.  We calculate  base business  growth by excluding
the following  service centers from the calculation for 15 months:

Service centers acquired within the past 15 months;

Service centers consolidated with acquired service centers; and

New service centers opened in new markets in the past 15 months.

The base business  calculation
 differs slightly from the same store calculation because base business includes (i) new
service  centers  opened in existing  markets and (ii) service  centers  affected due to
their  location in the immediate market areas of newly opened or acquired  locations.
 Additionally,  we allocate overhead expenses to the base business by considering base
business net sales as a percentage of total net sales.

The Swimming Pool
Industry

We  believe  that the  swimming
 pool  industry  is  relatively  young,  with room for  tremendous  growth.  Of the
approximately  68 million  households  in the United  States that have the economic
 capacity and the yard space to have a  swimming  pool,  barely  10% own a pool.  The
 industry  has  grown at a 4-5%  annual  rate for the past 20 years.

We believe the swimming pool
 industry  will continue to grow 4-5% annually over the next five years,  primarily by
the need to maintain the growing installed base of pools and secondarily by new pool
installations.

The greater part of revenues in our
industry is derived from the  maintenance  of existing  swimming  pools and the repair
and  replacement  of the equipment  that maintains  those pools.  Thus, the industry
 generally has not been negatively affected by economic downturns, although there is no
assurance that this will continue.

The  demand  for  new  pools  is
 driven  by  the  perceived  benefits  of  pool  ownership  including  relaxation,
entertainment,  family activity,  exercise,  convenience and landscaping.  The industry
competes for new pool sales against  other  discretionary  consumer  purchases  such as
kitchen and bathroom  remodeling,  boats,  motorcycles, recreational vehicles and
vacations.

The  business in the swimming  pool
 industry is seasonal,  and weather is the biggest  challenge.  The industry is also
affected by other  factors  including  consumer  saving and  discretionary  spending
 levels,  the rate of new housing construction and consumer attitudes toward pool
products for environmental or safety reasons.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Critical Accounting
Policies

Critical  accounting  policies are
those that are both important to the accurate portrayal of a company’s financial
condition and results,  and require the most difficult,  subjective or complex judgments,
 often as a result of the need to make  estimates  about the effect of matters that are
inherently  uncertain.  We believe that the nature of our business is such that there are
few, if any, complex challenges in accounting for operations.

In order to prepare  financial
 statements that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(GAAP), we make estimates and assumptions  that affect the
amounts  reported  in  our  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Certain
 estimates  are  particularly sensitive due to their  significance  to the financial
 statements  and the  possibility  that future events may be significantly different from
our expectations.

We have  identified  the following
five  accounting  policies that require us to make estimates in order to present fairly
our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an  allowance  for
 doubtful  accounts  for  estimated  losses if our  customers  do not make  required
payments.  We perform  periodic  credit  evaluations  of our customers and we typically
do not require  collateral. Consistent with industry  practices,  we require  payment
from our customers  within 30 days except for sales under early-buy  programs  for which
we provide  extended  payment  terms to  qualified  customers.  The  extended  terms
require  payments  in  equal  installments  in  April,  May and June or May and  June,
 depending  on  geographical location.  In the past, credit losses have been within our
expectations.

As our business is seasonal,  our
customers’  businesses are also seasonal.  Sales are lowest in the winter months, and our
past due  accounts  receivable  balance  generally  increases  during this time.  We
provide  reserves  for uncollectible  accounts based on the accounts  receivable  aging
ranging from 0.2% for amounts  currently due up to 100% for specific accounts more than
60 days past due.

At the end of each year,  we perform
a specific  reserve  analysis of all accounts  with past due balances  greater than
 $25,000.  Additionally,  we perform a general  reserve  analysis on the balance of our
 accounts  receivables with  emphasis on the  remainder  of the past due portion of the
aging.  As we review these past due  accounts,  we evaluate collectibility based on a
combination of factors including:

aging statistics and trends;

customer payment history;

independent credit reports; and

discussions with customers.

During  the  year,  we write  off
 account  balances  when we have  exhausted  reasonable  collection  efforts  and
determined  that the  likelihood of collection is remote.  Such  write-offs  are charged
 against our allowance for doubtful accounts.  In the past five years, write-offs have
averaged approximately 0.2% of net sales.

If the balance of the accounts
 receivable  reserve  increased or  decreased  by 50% at  December 31, 2002,  pretax
income  would  change by  approximately  $1.7 million  or $0.04 per  diluted  share
 based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at December 31, 2002.

Critical Accounting
Policies (continued)

Inventory
Obsolescence and Shrink Reserve

Product  inventories  represent the
largest asset on our balance  sheet.  Our goal is to manage our inventory  such that we
minimize  stock-outs  and provide the highest  level of service to our  customers.  To do
this, we maintain at each  service  center an  adequate  inventory  of SKUs with the
 highest  sales  volume.  At the same  time,  we continuously  strive to better  manage
our slower  moving  classes of  inventory  which are not as  critical to our customers
and thus  inherently  have lower velocity.  Service  centers  classify  products into 13
classes based on sales at that  location  over the past 12  months.  The table  below
 presents  a  description  of these  inventory classes:

Classes 1-3

Fastest moving items, which represent approximately 80% of net sales at the service center

Classes 4-12

Slower moving items, which we keep in stock to provide a high level of customer service

Class 13

Products with no sales at a particular service center for the past twelve months or special

order products not yet delivered to the customer

Products in classes 1-3 turn
 quickly,  thus there is little risk of  obsolescence.  We  establish  our reserve for
inventory  obsolescence  based on inventory  classes 4-13, with particular  emphasis on
SKUs with the weakest sales over the  previous 12 months.  The reserve is  intended to
reflect the value of  inventory  that we may not be able to sell at a profit.  We believe
our greatest  exposure to inventory  obsolescence  is inventory  classes 4-13. We
provide a  general  reserve  of 5% for such  inventory.  We also  provide  an  additional
 5%  reserve  for  excess inventory in classes 4-12 and an additional 45% for excess
class  13 inventory.  We define excess  inventory as the amount of inventory on hand in
excess of the previous 12 months usage on a company-wide basis.

In  evaluating  the adequacy of the
reserve for inventory  obsolescence  and shrink,  we consider a combination  of factors
including:

the level of inventory in relationship  to historical  sales level by product,  including  inventory usage
     by class based on product sales at both the service center and company levels;

changes in customer preferences;

the experience of the service center manager;

the previous inventory management performance of the service center;

geographical location; and

new product offerings.

The  reserve  for  inventory
  obsolescence   may  periodically   require   adjustment  as  changes  occur  in  the
above-identified factors.

If the balance of the inventory
 reserve  increased or decreased by 50% at  December 31, 2002,  pretax income would

Critical Accounting
Policies (continued)

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance
with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 101,

Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements,

and the appropriate amendments. SAB 101 requires that four basic criteria
must be met before we can recognize revenue:

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;

Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;

The amounts recognized are fixed and determinable; and

Collectibility is reasonably assured.

We record revenue when  customers
 take delivery of products.  Customers may pick up products at any service center
location,  or products may be delivered via our trucks or third party  carriers.
 Products  shipped via third party carriers are considered delivered based on the
shipping terms, which are generally FOB shipping point.

We may offer volume  rebates,  which
we accrue  monthly as an  adjustment  to net sales.  Additionally,  in certain markets,
 we may offer  discount  terms of 5% for  invoices  paid  within  10 days.  We  record
 customer  returns, including those associated with early-buy  programs,  as an
adjustment to net sales. In the past,  customer returns have not been material.

Vendor Rebates

We account for vendor rebates in
accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 02-16,

Accounting by a Customer
(Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor

. Many of our
arrangements with our vendors provide for us to receive a rebate of a specified amount of
consideration, payable to us when we achieve any of a number of measures, generally
related to a specified cumulative level of purchases from our vendors. We account for
such rebates as a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s products and therefore as
a reduction of inventory until we sell the product, at which time such rebates reduce
cost of sales in our income statement. Throughout the year, we estimate the amount of the
rebate earned based on our estimate of purchases to date relative to the purchase levels
that mark our progress toward earning the rebates. We continually revise these estimates
to reflect actual rebates earned based on actual purchase levels.

If market conditions were to change,
vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs. Such changes could lower
or raise our gross margins on products we sell or revenues earned.

Goodwill

Goodwill  represents  the excess of
 acquisition  costs over the estimated  fair value of net assets  acquired.  At December 31, 2002,
 our net  goodwill  balance  was  $107.7 million,  representing  27% of total  assets and
76% of stockholders’ equity.

In January 2002, we adopted SFAS
142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. Under these new rules, we no longer
amortize goodwill. Instead, we test goodwill for impairment annually or at any
other time when impairment indicators exist.

We completed the  transitional
 goodwill  impairment  test as required under SFAS 142 and determined  that goodwill was
 not  impaired.  This  transitional  test  required  comparison  of  our  Company’s
 estimated  fair  value  at January 1, 2002  to the book value,  including  goodwill.
 Additionally,  we performed the first annual  impairment test in October 2002 noting
that goodwill is not impaired.

If  circumstances  change or events
 occur to indicate  that our  Company’s  fair market value has fallen below the book
 value,  we will  compare the  estimated  fair value of the  goodwill to its book value.
 If the book value of goodwill  exceeds the estimated fair value of goodwill,  we will
recognize the difference as an impairment  loss in operating income.

Net sales increased  $129.0 million,
 or 15%, to $983.2 million in 2002 from  $854.2 million in 2001. Base business growth of
10% contributed  $84.5 million to the increase,  while acquired service centers
(primarily the Fort Wayne Acquisition in August 2002 and  secondarily  part of the Hughes
 Acquisition  in January 2001) and service  centers consolidated with acquired  locations
 accounted for the remaining  increase.  Same store sales growth was also 10% in 2002.
 The increase in base business sales is primarily due to the following:

More favorable weather conditions in 2002;

A larger installed base of swimming pools resulting in increased sales of non-discretionary products; and

The continued successful execution of our sales, marketing and service programs.

Gross  profit  increased  $34.6 million,
 or 16%,  to  $255.5 million  in 2002 from  $220.9 million  in 2001.  This increase was
primarily due to the increase in net sales.  Base business gross profit  contributed
 $22.8 million to the increase,  while acquired service centers and service centers
 consolidated with acquired  locations  accounted for the remaining increase.  Same store
gross profit contributed $12.5 million to the increase.

Gross  profit  as a  percentage  of
net sales  (“gross  margin”)  remained  relatively  unchanged  at 26.0% in 2002 compared
to 25.9% in 2001.

Excluding goodwill amortization in
2001, operating expenses increased  $28.0 million,  or 18%, to $182.8 million in 2002
from  $154.8 million in 2001.  Operating expenses relating to the base business
 contributed  $15.0 million to this increase,  while acquired service centers and
locations  consolidated  with acquired service centers accounted for the remaining
 increase.  Excluding  goodwill  amortization in 2001,  operating expenses as a
percentage of net sales  increased  to 18.6% in 2002 from 18.1% in 2001,  primarily  due
to the  dilutive  impact of newly opened and acquired  service  centers.  Base business
 operating  expenses as a percentage of net sales remained  unchanged at 17.9% in 2002
and 2001.  On a same store basis,  operating  expenses  increased  $5.9 million  in 2002
 compared to 2001.

Interest expense decreased  $0.3 million
to $5.0 million in 2002 from  $5.3 million in 2001.  Although average debt outstanding
was higher in 2002, the effective  interest rate decreased to 3.7% in 2002 from 5.0% in
2001,  which is consistent with the overall decline in interest rates over the past year.

Income taxes increased  $3.3 million
to $26.4 million  for 2002 compared to $23.1 million  for 2001,  primarily due to the
 $9.1 million  increase in income before income taxes.  In the first quarter of 2002,
 our effective  income tax rate  decreased  to 39.0% from 39.5% as a result of changes in
our state income tax mix, and income tax expense in 2002 was booked at an effective rate
of 39.0%.

Results of Operations

2001 compared to

(continued)

The base business sales growth trend
was adversely  affected in 2001 primarily by  unfavorable  weather  throughout most of
the year.  The pool season  experienced  a slow start with extended cold weather in the
North and unusually wet  conditions in the South.  Mild  temperatures  in the North
during the summer  months  further  aggravated  the season’s slow start,  while a
stagnant  tropical  system shut down the pool  business in the south  central  United
States for two weeks in June,  which is typically the most active sales month.
 Additionally,  the tragic events of September 11th put a damper on 2001 late season
sales in the swimming pool industry.

Gross profit increased  $56.5 million,
 or 34%, to  $220.9 million in 2001 compared to $164.4 million in 2000. Base business
gross profit growth of nearly 10%  contributed  $15.8 million  to the increase,  while
acquired  locations and new service  centers in new markets  accounted for the remaining
 increase.  Same store gross profit growth was nearly 9% in 2001.  Base business gross
profit growth was due to several factors including:

a 3% increase in base business sales;

improvements in pricing accuracy and greater pricing discipline at the point of sale;

a continued  focus on a preferred  vendor program  initiated in 1999 which  encourages  service centers to
     purchase  products  from a smaller  number  of  vendors  in order to  effect  more  efficient  purchasing  and
     inventory management;

increased sales of complementary products that typically enjoy higher gross margins; and

the  utilization of centralized  shipping  locations which purchase  slower turning  inventories  (such as
     parts) in bulk quantities and then redistribute products to service centers.

These  improvements  led to an
increase in gross  margin to 25.9% in 2001 from 24.5% in 2000,  despite the dilutive
impact of newly opened and acquired  service  centers.  Base business gross margin
 increased to 26.5% in 2001 from 24.8% in 2000.

Operating  expenses  consisting  of
 selling  and  administrative  expenses  and  goodwill  amortization  increased $41.4 million,
 or 36%, to  $157.0 million in 2001 from  $115.6 million  in 2000.  Acquired service
centers and new locations in new markets accounted for $32.7 million of the increase.
 Base business  operating  expenses increased $8.7 million primarily due to the following:

increases in salary expense to support the increase in sales and a continued  focus on improving  customer
     service;

an increase in  occupancy  costs due to the  relocation  of existing  service  centers to larger  sites to
     accommodate their growth in activity and the introduction of new products; and

an increase in freight costs resulting from higher gas prices in 2001.

Operating  expenses as a  percentage
 of net sales  increased  to 18.4% in 2001 from 17.2% in 2000.  Base  business operating
 expense as a  percentage  of net sales  increased  80 basis  points to 18.0% in 2001
from 17.2% in 2000, primarily due to our increased  investment in sales,  marketing and
service  programs and lower than expected sales in 2001 caused by the unfavorable weather
conditions discussed above.

Results of Operations

2001 compared to

(continued)

Interest  expense  increased  $1.7 million
 to $5.3 million  in 2001 from  $3.6 million  in 2000 primarily  because average debt
outstanding  increased to $63.8 million  in 2001 compared to $38.3 million in 2000.
 Additionally,  we wrote-off  approximately  $0.2 million of financing costs in the
fourth quarter of 2001 when we replaced our Senior Loan Facility one year prior to the
maturity date.

Income taxes increased  $6.0 million
to $23.1 million  for 2001 compared to $17.1 million  for 2000,  primarily due to the
 $13.4 million  increase in income  before income taxes.  During the fourth  quarter of
2001,  our effective income tax rate increased to 39.5% from 38.5% as a result of changes
in our state income tax mix.

Seasonality and
Quarterly Fluctuations

Our business is highly seasonal,
 and weather is the principal  external factor  affecting our business.  The table below
presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions:

Weather

Possible Effects

Hot and dry

•

Increased purchases of chemicals and supplies

for existing swimming pools

•

Increased purchases of above-ground pools

Unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary

•

Fewer pool installations

amounts of rain

•

Decreased purchases of chemicals and supplies

•

Decreased purchases of impulse items such as

above-ground pools and accessories

Unseasonably early warming trends

•

A longer pool season, thus increasing our sales

(primarily in the northern half of the US)

Unseasonably late warming trends

•

A shorter pool season, thus decreasing our sales

(primarily in the northern half of the US)

In general,  sales and operating
income are highest during the second and third quarters,  which represent the peak months
of swimming pool use and installation.  Sales are  substantially  lower during the first
and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses.

In 2002,  approximately  66% of net
sales  were  generated  in the  second  and  third  quarters  of the year,  and
approximately 100% of operating income was generated in that same period.

We  typically  experience  a
build-up of product  inventories  and  accounts  payable  during the winter  months in
anticipation  of the  upcoming  peak  selling  season.  Excluding  borrowings  to
 finance  acquisitions  and share repurchases,  our peak borrowing  usually occurs in
late first quarter or early second quarter,  primarily  because extended  payment  terms
 offered by our suppliers  typically  are payable in April,  May and June,  while our
peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in June, July and August.

We expect that our quarterly
 results of operations  will continue to fluctuate  depending on the timing and amount of
revenue  contributed by new and acquired service  centers.  We attempt to open new
service centers at the end of the fourth  quarter or the first quarter of the subsequent
 year to take advantage of preseason  sales programs and the upcoming peak selling season.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

Liquidity  is defined as the ability
to generate  adequate  amounts of cash to meet the current  need for cash.  We assess our
 liquidity  in terms of our  ability to  generate  cash to fund our  operating
 activities,  taking into consideration  the seasonal nature of our business.
 Significant  factors which could affect liquidity  include the following:

The adequacy of available bank lines of credit;

The ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms;

Cash flows generated from operating activities;

Acquisitions;

The timing and extent of share repurchases; and

Capital expenditures.

Our primary  sources of working
capital are cash from  operations  supplemented  by bank borrowings  under a credit
agreement (the Credit  Agreement)  with a group of banks.  Our primary  capital needs are
seasonal  working capital obligations and other general  corporate  purposes,  including
 acquisitions  and share  repurchases.  In the past, borrowings,  together with cash from
 operations and seller  financing,  have been sufficient to support our growth and to
finance acquisitions.

The Credit  Agreement,  which
 matures on November 27, 2004,  allows us to borrow under a revolving  line of credit
(the Revolving  Credit  Facility).  In August 2002, we expanded our borrowing  capacity
under the Revolving  Credit Facility from $110.0 million to $150.0 million to facilitate
the Fort Wayne Acquisition and share repurchases.

Resources (continued)

During the twelve months ended
 December 31, 2002,  we received net proceeds of  $40.2 million  under the Revolving
Credit  Facility.  At  December 31, 2002,  there was  $125.2 million  outstanding and
 $24.8 million  available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility,  subject to
borrowing base availability  supported by trade accounts receivable and product
 inventories.  In order to meet seasonal  working  capital needs, in  the first quarter of 2003  we
also borrowed  additional  funds  in the  form  of two  short-term  notes.  On March 13, 2003 there was
$7.0 million outstanding and $3.0 million available for borrowing under these notes.

The average  effective  interest
rate of the Revolving  Credit  Facility was 3.7% for the twelve month period ended
December 31, 2002.  Interest  on  borrowings  under  the  Revolving  Credit  Facility
 may be paid at either of the following rates, in each case depending on our leverage
ratio:

the  agent’s  corporate  base rate or the federal  funds rate plus 0.5%,  whichever  is higher,  plus a margin
     ranging from 0.125% to 0.375%, or

the current Eurodollar Rate plus a margin ranging from 1.125% to 1.750%.

Substantially  all of our  assets,
 including  the  capital  stock of our  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  secure  our
obligations  under  the  Revolving  Credit  Facility.  The  Revolving  Credit  Facility
 has  numerous  restrictive covenants,  which  require that we maintain a minimum net
worth and fixed charge  coverage and which also  restrict our ability to pay  dividends.
 As of  December 31, 2002,  we were in  compliance  with all covenants and financial
ratio requirements.

At  December 31, 2002,  our
 contractual  obligations  of long-term  debt and operating  leases were as follows (in
thousands):

Net cash provided by operating
 activities  increased  $32.4 million to $59.2 million in 2002 from $26.8 million in
2001,  primarily  due to the  decrease  in  product  inventories,  partially  offset by
the  decrease  in  accounts payable.  In 2001,  net cash  provided  by  operating
 activities  increased  $8.5 million  to  $26.8 million  from $18.3 million in 2000,
primarily due to a $7.3 million increase in net income.

In the fourth  quarter of 2001, we
made payments to vendors of  approximately  $27.4 million for product  inventory receipts
with extended  terms.  We made these  payments to take advantage of prompt  payment
 discounts  offered by manufacturers  in the fourth  quarter of 2001.  Such off season
early buy purchases are normal in the pool industry except for  manufacturers  choosing
to ship on a more accelerated basis in the fourth quarter of 2001 versus prior year
fourth  quarters.  These purchases  consisted mainly of high velocity whole goods such as
pumps,  filters,  heaters and cleaners with little risk of obsolescence.

Initially,  acquisitions  are
financed through  increased  borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and those
borrowings are then reduced with cash flows from  operations.  The same principle
 applies for funds used for share repurchases and capital expenditures.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources (continued)

We believe we have adequate
 availability of capital to fund present operations and anticipated  growth,  including
expansion in existing and targeted market areas. We continually  evaluate  potential
 acquisitions and we have held discussions  with a number of  acquisition  candidates.
 However,  we  currently  have no  binding  agreement  with respect to any acquisition
 candidate.  If suitable  acquisition  opportunities or working capital needs arise that
would require  additional  financing,  we believe that our financial  position and
earnings history provide a solid base for obtaining  additional  financing  resources at
 competitive  rates and terms.  Additionally,  we may issue common or preferred stock to
raise funds.

Accounts Receivable
and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Excluding  the  approximate   $5.9 million
 Fort  Wayne  accounts   receivable,   accounts   receivable   increased $4.0 million,
 or 7%, to $64.2 million at December 31, 2002  compared to $60.2 million at  December 31, 2001.
 This increase is less than the 10% increase in base business net sales between periods.

The  allowance  for  doubtful
 accounts  increased  to  $3.3 million  at  December 31, 2002  from  $2.8 million  at
December 31, 2001.  This increase is consistent  with the increase in gross and past due
accounts  receivable  from 2001 to 2002.  We continue to maintain an adequate  reserve of
the greater than 60 days past due  receivables.  The allowance  remained  relatively
 consistent  as a percentage  of the greater than 60 days past due  receivables  at 47.7%
at December 31, 2002 compared to 45.9% at December 31, 2001.

Product Inventories
and the Reserve for Shrink and Obsolescence

Excluding the approximate  $20.9 million
Fort Wayne inventory,  product  inventories  decreased  $18.7 million,  or 10%, to $162.8 million
 at December 31, 2002 from  $181.5 million  at  December 31, 2001.  As discussed in our
2001 annual report on Form 10-K, the inventory  balance at the end of 2001 was
approximately  $35.0 million  higher than typically  required  at the end of the year
 because we  received  significant  early-buy  purchases  in the fourth quarter of 2001
from  manufacturers  motivated to reduce their own inventory  levels.  Adjusted for the
 additional $35.0 million  of  inventory  received  in late 2001 and  excluding  the Fort
 Wayne  inventory  in 2002,  our base business inventory increased by approximately  $16.3 million,
 or 11%, which is consistent with the 10% increase in base business  sales.  Average
 inventory  per service  center at the end of 2002 was  approximately  $145,000 less than
average inventory per service center at December 31, 2001.

As we continue to improve the
 quality of our  inventory,  the  inventory  reserve  has  decreased  accordingly  to $3.1 million
 at  December 31, 2002  from  $3.9 million  at  December 31, 2001.  The  reserve  as a
 percentage  of slow-moving  class 13  inventory  decreased  to 40.2% at the
end of 2002  compared to 46.1% at the end of 2001. At  December 31, 2002,  approximately
70% of our inventory  balance was comprised of high velocity  inventory classes 1 through 3.

Share Repurchase
Program

Between  March 1999 and December
 2002, we purchased  3.8 million  shares of our common stock in the open market at an
 average  price of $19.69 per share,  including  1.8 million  shares  purchased  in 2002
at an average  price of $26.19.  In December 2002, we retired all treasury shares.

Between February 13, 2003 and March 13, 2003,
we  purchased 128,200  shares of our common  stock in the open  market at an average  price of $26.03
per share.

As  part of our  share  repurchase
 program,  in  July  2002  our  Board  of  Directors  authorized  an  additional $50.0 million
for share repurchases, of which $35.2 million remained available as of March 13, 2003.
We intend to continue to repurchase shares on the open market from time to time, depending on market conditions.

The impact of our common stock
 repurchases had the effect of reducing diluted weighted average shares  outstanding by
approximately 0.8 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2002.

potential  changes in these  market risks are  discussed  below.  The  following
 discussion  does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall  economic
 activity that could exist  following such changes.  Further,  in the event of changes of
such magnitude, we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes.

Interest Rate Risk

Our earnings are exposed to changes
in  short-term  interest  rates because of the variable  interest  rates on our long-term
debt. If (i) the  variable rates on our Revolving  Credit  Facility  increased or
decreased 1.0% from the rate at  December 31, 2002;  and (ii) we borrowed the maximum
amount  available under the Revolving Credit Facility ($150.0 million)  for all of 2003,
then our pretax income would change by  approximately  $1.5 million or $0.04 per diluted
 share  based on the number of  diluted  shares  outstanding  at  December 31, 2002.  The
fair value of our Revolving Credit Facility is not affected by changes in market interest
rates.

Foreign Exchange Risk

We have  wholly-owned  subsidiaries
in the United Kingdom,  France,  Portugal and Canada.  In the past, we have not hedged
our  foreign  currency  exposure,  and  fluctuations  in exchange  rates have not
 materially  affected  our operating  results.  Future changes in exchange rates may
positively or negatively  impact our revenues,  operating expenses and earnings.
 However,  due to the size of our foreign operations,  we do not anticipate that exposure
to foreign currency rate fluctuations will be material in 2003.

Cautionary  Statement
for Purpose of the “Safe Harbor” Provisions of the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform
Act of 1995

Our  disclosure  and  analysis  in
this  report  contains  forward-looking  information  that  involves  risks  and
uncertainties.  From  time to  time,  we may also  provide  oral or  written
 forward-looking  statements  in other materials  we release to the public.
 Forward-looking  statements  give our current  expectations  or  forecasts of possible
future results or events.  You can identify these  statements by the fact that they do
not relate strictly to historic or current facts. We often use words such as “anticipate”,
 “estimate”,  “expect”,  “believe” and other words  and  terms  of  similar  meaning  in
 connection  with any  discussion  of  future  operating  or  financial performance.

Among the factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially are the following:

the sensitivity of the industry to weather conditions

the intense competition and low barriers to entry in the industry

the sensitivity of the industry to general economic and market conditions

our ability to:

•

penetrate new
markets

•

identify appropriate
acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms and successfully
integrate acquired businesses

•

obtain financing
on satisfactory terms

•

generate sufficient
cash flows to support expansion plans and for general operating activities

•

maintain
favorable supplier arrangements and relationships

•

remain in
compliance with the numerous environmental, health and safety requirements to which we are
subject

the effectiveness of our advertising, marketing and promotional programs

changes in laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements (including tax rate
     changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations)

the risk of fire, safety and casualty losses and related liability claims inherent in the storage of chemicals that we
     sell

We cannot  guarantee that any future
event or result will be realized,  although we believe we have been prudent in our plans
and assumptions.  Should additional risks or uncertainties materialize,  or should
underlying assumptions prove  inaccurate,  actual results could differ  materially from
those  anticipated.  Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking
statements.

1934  (the  “Act”).  The  rules  refer  to the  controls  and  other  procedures
 designed  to  ensure  that information  required to be  disclosed  in reports  that we
file or submit  under the Act is  recorded,  processed, summarized and reported  within
the time periods  specified.  As of  December 31, 2002,  Management,  including the CEO
and CFO,  performed an evaluation of the  effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure  controls and procedures.  Based on that  evaluation,  Management,
 including the CEO and CFO,  concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of December 31, 2002.

We maintain a system of internal
 accounting  controls that are designed to provide  reasonable  assurance that our books
and records  accurately  reflect our  transactions  and that our policies and procedures
are followed.  There have been no  significant  changes in our internal  controls or in
other  factors that could  significantly  affect internal controls subsequent to December 31, 2002.

Report of Independent
Auditors

The Board of Directors

SCP Pool
Corporation

We have audited the consolidated
balance sheets of SCP Pool Corporation as of  December 31, 2002  and 2001, and the
related consolidated  statements of income,  stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended  December 31, 2002.  Our audits also included the
financial  statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15a2.  These  financial
 statements  and schedule are the  responsibility  of the  Company’s  management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in
accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally  accepted in the United  States.  Those
standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance
 about whether the financial statements are free of material  misstatement.  An audit
includes examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting the  amounts  and  disclosures
 in the  financial  statements.  An audit also  includes  assessing  the  accounting
principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as
 evaluating  the  overall  financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our  opinion,  the  financial
 statements  referred to above  present  fairly,  in all  material  respects,  the
consolidated  financial  position of SCP Pool  Corporation  at  December 31, 2002  and
2001,  and the  consolidated results of its  operations  and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period  ended  December 31, 2002, in conformity  with  accounting
 principles  generally  accepted in the United  States.  Also, in our opinion,  the
related  financial  statement  schedule,  when considered in relation to the basic
financial  statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2002 the Company changed
its method of accounting for goodwill.

Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the

Company

, which may be referred
to as

SCP

,

we

), maintained 185 service centers in North America and Europe
from which we sell swimming pool equipment, parts and supplies to pool builders, retail
stores and service companies. We distribute products through two national networks: The
SCP network and the Superior Pool Products (SPP) network.

Net sales by geographic region were
as follows (in thousands):

Property and equipment by geographic
region were as follows (in thousands):

Basis of Presentation
and Principles of Consolidation

We prepared the  consolidated
 financial  statements  following  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the
United  States  (GAAP) and the  requirements  of the  Securities  and  Exchange
 Commission  (SEC).  The  financial statements  include  all normal  and  recurring
 adjustments  that are  necessary  for a fair  presentation  of our financial position
and operating results.

The  consolidated  financial
 statements  include  the  accounts  of SCP  Pool  Corporation  and  our  wholly-owned
subsidiaries.  We eliminated all significant intercompany accounts and transactions.

Use of Estimates

In order to prepare  financial
 statements that conform to GAAP, we make estimates and assumptions  that affect the
amounts  reported in our financial  statements and accompanying  notes.  Our most
 significant  estimates are those relating to the allowance for doubtful  accounts and
the inventory  reserve.  We  continually  review our estimates and make adjustments as
necessary,  but actual results could be significantly  different from what we expected
when we made these estimates.

Segment Reporting

Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 131,

Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,

establishes standards for the way
that public companies report information about operating segments in annual financial
statements and establishes standards for related disclosures about products and
services, geographic areas and major customers. We have reviewed SFAS 131 and
determined that we have a single reportable segment.

Seasonality and Weather

Our business is highly seasonal,
 and weather is the principal  external factor  affecting our business.  The table below
presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions:

Weather

Possible Effects

Hot and dry

•

Increased purchases of chemicals and supplies

for existing swimming pools

•

Increased purchases of above-ground pools

Unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary

•

Fewer pool installations

amounts of rain

•

Decreased purchases of chemicals and supplies

•

Decreased purchases of impulse items such as

above-ground pools and accessories

Unseasonably early warming trends

•

A longer pool season, thus increasing our sales

(primarily in the northern half of the US)

Unseasonably late warming trends

•

A shorter pool season, thus decreasing our sales

(primarily in the northern half of the US)

In  general,  sales and net income
are  highest  during the second and third  quarters,  which  represent  the peak months
of swimming pool use and installation.  Sales are  substantially  lower during the first
and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses.

Earnings Per Share

In accordance with SFAS 128,

Earnings per Share

, we calculate basic earnings per share by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share includes
the dilutive effects of stock options and convertible notes.

Financial Instruments

The carrying values of cash,
 receivables,  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  approximate fair value due to
the short  maturity of those  instruments.  The carrying  amount of long-term  debt
 approximates  fair value as it bears interest at variable rates.

Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid
 investments  with an original  maturity of three months or less when purchased to be
cash equivalents.

Credit Risk and
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We perform  periodic  credit
 evaluations of our customers and we typically do not require  collateral.  Consistent
with industry  practices,  we require  payment from our customers  within 30 days except
for sales under  early-buy programs for which we provide  extended  payment  terms to
qualified  customers.  In the past,  credit  losses have been within our expectations.

For a complete  discussion  of the
 allowance  for  doubtful  accounts,  see Item 7,  Management’s  Discussion  and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Product Inventories
and Reserve for Inventory Obsolescence and Shrink

Product  inventories  represent the
largest  asset on our balance sheet and consist  primarily of goods we purchase from
 manufacturers  and  intend to sell to our  customers.  We record  inventory  at the
lower of cost,  using the average cost method, or market.  Our largest  suppliers are
Pentair  Corporation,  Hayward Pool Products,  Inc. and Bio-Lab,  Inc. (a subsidiary of
Great Lakes Chemicals,  Inc.). These suppliers provided  approximately 13%, 10% and 7%,
respectively, of the products we sold in 2002.

We account for vendor rebates in accordance with
the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 02-16,

Accounting by a Customer (Including
a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor

.  Many of our  arrangements  with our
 vendors  provide  for us to  receive  a rebate of a  specified  amount of
consideration,  payable  to us when we  achieve  any of a number of  measures,  generally
 related  to a  specified cumulative  level of purchases  from our  vendors.  We account
for such rebates as a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s  products and therefore as
a reduction of inventory until we sell the product,  at which time such rebates reduce
cost of sales in our income  statement.  Throughout  the year,  we estimate the amount of
the rebate  earned based on our estimate of purchases to date relative to the purchase
 levels that mark our progress  toward  earning the rebates.  We continually revise
these  estimates to reflect actual rebates earned based on actual  purchase levels.

For a complete  discussion of
product  inventories and the inventory reserve,  see Item 7, Management’s  Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Property and Equipment

Property and  equipment are stated

On January 1, 2002 we adopted SFAS
144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

, which addresses
financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
assets. SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS 121,

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of

, and the accounting and reporting
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) 30,

Reporting the Results of
Operations for a Disposal of a Segment of a Business

. The adoption of this Statement
did not have a material impact on our financial position or operating results.

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

Under the provisions of SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, we test goodwill for impairment annually or at
any other time when impairment indicators exist. We test intangible assets with
finite lives under the provisions of SFAS 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

, which requires testing for recoverability whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may
not be recoverable.

Self Insurance

We retain certain  self-insurance
 risks for both health benefits and property and casualty insurance programs.  We have
limited our exposure by  maintaining  excess and aggregate  liability  coverage.  We
establish  self-insurance reserves  based on claims filed and  estimates of claims
 incurred but not  reported.  The  estimates  are based on information provided to us by
the claims administrators.

Advertising Costs

Advertising  costs are  expensed as
 incurred.  The table  below  presents  advertising  expense for the past three years (in
thousands):

3,194

$

Income Taxes

We record deferred income taxes
under the provisions of SFAS 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between (i)
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
(ii) the amounts used for income tax purposes. We measure the assets and liabilities
using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences
are expected to reverse.

Stock Compensation
Arrangements

Under the provisions of SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, companies may account for employee stock
options using either (i) SFAS 123’s fair value method or (ii) the intrinsic value
method provided by APB 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

. Under the
SFAS 123 fair value method, companies recognize compensation expense related to
employee stock options based on the fair value of the options on the grant date as
estimated by an option pricing model. The intrinsic value method prescribed by APB 25
requires recognition of compensation expense when the exercise price of the granted
options is less than the stock’s market price on the grant date.

We account for our employee stock
options under the intrinsic  value method  described by APB 25.  Accordingly,  we do not
record  compensation  expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to the stock’s
market price on the grant  date.  The table  below  presents  compensation  expense  for
options  granted  below  market  price (in thousands):

Stock Compensation
Arrangements (continued)

If we had  accounted  for our
employee  stock  options  using the fair value method  described in SFAS 123, our net
income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the  pro-forma  amounts  below
(in  thousands,  except per share data):

For purposes of pro-forma
 disclosures,  the estimated fair value of employee  options is ratably expensed over the
options’  vesting  period.  We estimated  the fair value of these  options at the grant
date using a  Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions:

The  Black-Scholes  option
 valuation model was developed to estimate the fair value of traded options that have no
vesting  restrictions  and are fully  transferable.  Additionally,  option  valuation
 models  require the input of highly subjective  assumptions  including the expected
stock price volatility.  In our opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options because:

The  characteristics  of our employee stock options are significantly  different from those of traded options;
     and

Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance
with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 101,

Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements,

and the appropriate amendments. SAB 101 requires that four basic criteria
must be met before we can recognize revenue:

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;

Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;

The amounts recognized are fixed and determinable; and

Collectibility is reasonably assured.

We record revenue when  customers
 take delivery of products.  Customers may pick up products at any service center
location,  or products may be delivered via our trucks or third party  carriers.
 Products  shipped via third party carriers are considered delivered based on the
shipping terms, which are generally FOB shipping point.

Derivatives and
Hedging Activities

We recognize all  derivatives  at
fair value on the balance  sheet.  The  effective  portion of changes in the fair value
of derivatives  qualifying as cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive
 income until the hedged item is  recognized  in  earnings,  or until it  becomes
 unlikely  that the hedged  transaction  will  occur.  The ineffective portion of a
derivative’s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.

In May 2001,  we entered  into two
 interest  rate swap  agreements  as cash flow hedges to reduce our  exposure to
fluctuations  in interest  rates.  Any  differences  paid or received on our interest
rate swaps were recognized as adjustments  to  interest  expense  over the life of each
 swap.  The swaps  expired on  December 31, 2002,  and no ineffectiveness was recognized
over the life of the swaps.

Shipping and Handling
Costs

We include  shipping and handling
fees billed to customers in net sales,  and we record shipping and handling costs
associated  with  inbound  freight  as cost of  sales.  The  table  below  presents
 shipping  and  handling  costs associated with outbound freight which we include in

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of
the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of the net
assets acquired. In June 2001, we adopted SFAS 141,

Business Combinations

, and in
January 2002 we adopted SFAS 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. Under these new
rules, we no longer amortize goodwill. Instead, we test goodwill for impairment
annually or at any other time when impairment indicators exist. Under the
provisions of SFAS 142, we continue to amortize our intangible assets consisting
of non-compete agreements because they have finite lives.

We completed the  transitional
 goodwill  impairment  test as required under SFAS 142 and determined  that goodwill was
 not  impaired.  This  transitional  test  required  comparison  of  our  Company’s
 estimated  fair  value  at January 1, 2002  to the book value,  including  goodwill.
 Additionally,  we performed the first annual  impairment test in October 2002 noting
that goodwill is not impaired.

Through December 31, 2001, we
amortized goodwill on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 20-40 years.

We amortize non-compete agreements
over the contractual terms.

of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2002 are as follows (in thousands):

Acquisitions

In August 2002,  we purchased 100%
of the outstanding  common shares of  Fort Wayne Pools, Inc.  (Fort Wayne or the Fort Wayne
 Acquisition).  Fort Wayne was a distributor  and  manufacturer  of swimming pool
 equipment,  parts and supplies, and its distribution network consisted of 22 service
centers in 16 states.

The  acquisition  of Fort Wayne  is
 consistent  with our strategy of  complementing  our internal  growth with the purchase
of additional  service  centers.  The acquisition of these additional  22 service
 centers will expand the reach and market  share of our SPP network  allowing us to
enhance our service  capabilities  and better  serve the growing  pool  industry.  In the
 fourth  quarter  of 2002,  we closed  one  location  and  consolidated  13 of the 22 acquired
 service  centers with SPP locations.  The remaining  eight service centers will operate
as part of the SPP network.

The  approximate  $49.7 million
cash purchase  price    was  determined  based on
negotiations  with  the  former  shareholders  of Fort  Wayne  and our  valuation
 considerations,  which  included historical  and  prospective  earnings,  net asset
value and other  valuation  considerations  consistent  with our historical  valuations
of acquisitions.  In accordance with the purchase  agreement,  we placed $1.0 million of
the purchase price in an escrow account to secure certain  indemnification  and other
 post-closing  obligations of the sellers, and any amounts remaining in the escrow
account in August 2005 will be paid to the sellers.

We do not expect the goodwill

purposes.  Additionally,  we signed non-compete  agreements with certain former Fort Wayne
 shareholders  providing for payments in the aggregate of $5.0 million  over the next
five years. We recorded the non-compete  agreements at their present value of $4.4 million.

We have  included  the results of
 Fort Wayne’s  operations  in the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  since the
acquisition date.

We completed  three  acquisitions
 in 2001 (the 2001  Acquisitions).  In January 2001, we completed the purchase of
substantially  all of the assets and the  assumption of certain  liabilities of the pool
division of Hughes Supply, Inc. (Hughes or the Hughes  Acquisition).  Hughes distributed
 swimming pool equipment,  parts and supplies through 31 locations in the eastern half of
the United States.  The  acquisition of these 31 service  centers allowed us to further
our presence in existing  markets and enter new markets.  Five of these service  centers
operate in the SCP network and the remaining 26 operate as part of the SPP  network.
 We financed the  approximate  $47.5 million cash purchase price with  borrowings  under
our revolving line of credit and a  $25.0 million  short-term  seller’s note  issued by
Hughes (the  Hughes  Note).  The Hughes Note was fully paid in  November  2001.  We

 five-year  contractual life.

In July and October  2001, we
acquired the capital  stock of  Exporlinea  Importação e Exportação  de  Equipamentos
para  Tratamento  de Águas E Outros,  LDA  (Exporlinea)  and  certain  assets of Capital
 Pool  Industries  Limited (Capital),  distributors of swimming pool equipment,  parts
and supplies.  Exporlinea  operated two service centers in Portimao and Lisbon,
 Portugal.  Capital operated three service centers in Ontario,  Canada.  As a result of
the Exporlinea and Capital  Acquisitions,  we expanded our  international  operations
from four service centers to nine service centers.

Acquisitions
(continued)

We accounted for the 2001
 Acquisitions  using the purchase method of accounting,  and we have included the results
of operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements since their respective acquisition
dates.

We  completed  two  acquisitions  in
2000 (the 2000  Acquisitions).  In July 2000,  we  completed  the  purchase of
substantially all of the assets and the assumption of certain  liabilities of Superior
Pool Products,  Inc. (SPP or the  Superior  Acquisition),   a  distributor  of  swimming
 pool  equipment,  parts  and  supplies.  The  Superior Acquisition  added 19 service
 centers in  California,  Arizona and Nevada  allowing us to increase our presence in
existing  markets.  We allocated the  approximate  $23.5 million  cash purchase  price,
 net of cash  acquired,  as follows (in thousands):

We expect the  goodwill  acquired in
the Superior  Acquisition  to be fully  deductible  for tax  purposes.  We are amortizing
the non-compete  agreement using the  straight-line  method over the agreement’s
 four-year  contractual life.

In October  2000,  we  completed
 the purchase of  substantially  all of the assets and the  assumption  of certain
liabilities of Pool-Rite,  Inc., which distributed swimming pool equipment,  parts and
supplies through two service centers in Miami – Dade County, Florida.

We accounted for the 2000

Debt

The components of our debt for the
past two years were as follows (in thousands):

On November 27, 2001, we entered
into a new credit  agreement (the Credit  Agreement)  with a group of banks.  This Credit
 Agreement  replaced our previous Senior Loan Facility,  which consisted of a Term Loan
and a Revolver Loan. The Credit  Agreement,  which  matures on  November 27, 2004,
 allows us to borrow funds under a revolving  line of credit (the  Revolving  Credit
 Facility).  In August 2002, we expanded our borrowing  capacity under the Revolving
Credit  Facility  from  $110.0 million  to  $150.0 million  to  facilitate  the Fort
 Wayne  Acquisition  and share repurchases.

At  December 31, 2002,  there was
 $125.2 million  outstanding and $24.8 million  available for borrowing under the
Revolving  Credit  Facility,  subject to borrowing base  availability  supported by trade
 accounts  receivable and product  inventories.  We pay a quarterly  commitment  fee of
0.30% to 0.45%  (depending on our leverage  ratio) of the unused portion of available
credit under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The average  effective  interest
rate of the Revolving  Credit  Facility was 3.7% for the twelve month period ended
December 31, 2002.  Interest on  borrowings  under the  Revolving  Credit  Facility
 may be paid at either of the following rates, in each case depending on our leverage
ratio:

the agent’s  corporate base rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.5%,  whichever is higher,  plus a margin
     ranging from 0.125% to 0.375%, or

the current Eurodollar Rate plus a margin ranging from 1.125% to 1.750%

Substantially  all of our  assets,
 including  the  capital  stock of our  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  secure  our
obligations  under  the  Revolving  Credit  Facility.  The  Revolving  Credit  Facility
 has  numerous  restrictive covenants  which  require us to maintain a minimum net worth
and fixed charge  coverage and which also restrict our ability to pay  dividends.  As of
 December 31, 2002,  we were in  compliance  with all the covenants and financial ratio
requirements.

Additionally,  in 2002 we signed
non-compete  agreements with certain former Fort Wayne  shareholders providing for $1.0 million
 annual  payments over the next five years.  We recorded the  non-compete  agreements at
their present value of $4.4 million.

Debt
(continued)

In May 2001, we entered into two
interest rate swap  agreements,  primarily to reduce our exposure to  fluctuations in
interest  rates.  Under the swap  agreements,  we agreed to exchange,  at specified
 intervals,  the  difference between  fixed and  variable  interest  amounts  calculated
 by  reference  to a  notional  principal  amount.  Any differences  paid or received on
interest rate swap agreements  were recognized as adjustments to interest  expense over
the life of each swap,  thereby adjusting the effective  interest rate on the underlying
 obligation.  Both of our  interest  rate  swaps,  which  expired  on  December 31, 2002,
  were  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges.  No ineffectiveness related to these two
swaps was recognized in 2002.

We paid income taxes totaling $18.7 million
in 2002 and $18.4 million in 2001.

Income
Taxes (continued)

The components of the deferred tax
assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands):

We reduce federal, state and foreign
income taxes payable by the tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options.
 We receive an income tax benefit based on the difference between the option exercise
price and the fair market value of the stock at the time the option is exercised.  This benefit, which we record in stockholders’ equity, was $1.0 million in
2002 and $1.6 million in 2001.

Current U.S. income taxes and
foreign withholding taxes and deferred income taxes were not provided on undistributed
earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries.  We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely
in operations outside the United States.

Related
Party Transactions

In October 1999, we entered into a lease
agreement with S & C Development, LLC for a service center in Mandeville,
Louisiana. The sole member of S & C Development, LLC is A. David Cook, a SCP
executive officer. The seven year lease term commenced on
January 1, 2000, and we pay rent of $6,510 per month. In January 2002,
we entered into a lease agreement with S & C Development, LLC for additional
warehouse space adjacent to our Mandeville service center. The five year lease
term commenced on February 4, 2002, and we pay rent of $4,123 per

In March 1997,  we entered  into a
lease  agreement  with Kenneth St.  Romain for a service  center in Baton Rouge,
Louisiana.  Kenneth St. Romain is the son of Frank J. St. Romain,  who, until January
1999, was President and Chief Executive  Officer of SCP and who remains a director of
SCP. In January  2002,  we extended this lease for a second term of five years which
 commenced on  March 1, 2002.  We pay rent of $10,137 per month for the 23,500 square
foot facility.

Stock
Option and Stock Purchase Plans (continued)

The table below  summarizes information
about stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2002 (shares in thousands):

Under the 1995 Stock Option Plan
(the 1995 Plan) our Board of Directors  (the Board) was  authorized to grant stock
options to employees,  agents,  consultants or  independent  contractors.  No more than
 2,025,000  shares could be issued under the 1995 Plan.  The  exercise  price of the
granted  options was equal to our stock’s  market price on the grant date.  These
 options  generally  were  exercisable  two years after the grant date,  and they expire
ten years  from the  grant  date.  In May  1998,  the Board  suspended  the 1995  Plan.
 Options  granted  prior to the suspension were not affected by this action.

In May 1998, our  stockholders
 approved the 1998 Stock Option Plan (the 1998 Plan),  which authorized the Board to
grant stock options,  stock  appreciation  rights,  restricted stock and performance
 awards to employees,  agents, consultants or  independent  contractors.  No more than
2,531,250  shares could be issued under this plan. In 2002, the Board granted  351,200
 options under the 1998 Plan to our employees  and  officers.  Granted  options  usually
have an  exercise  price equal to our  stock’s  market  price on the grant date.  These
 options  generally  may be exercised  three or more years after the grant date,  and
they expire ten years after the grant date.  In May 2002, the Board suspended the 1998
Plan.  Options granted prior to the suspension were not affected by this action.

In May 2002, our  stockholders
 approved the 2002 Long-Term  Incentive Plan (the 2002 Plan),  which  authorizes the
Board to grant  stock  options and  restricted  stock  awards to  employees,  agents,
 consultants  or  independent contractors.  No more than 700,000  shares may be issued
under this plan.  As of December 31, 2002,  no shares were issued under the 2002 Plan.
 Granted  options will have an exercise  price equal to our stock’s market price on the
grant date.  These  options  generally may be exercised  three or more years after the
grant date,  and they expire ten years after the grant date.

The SCP Pool Corporation
 Non-Employee  Directors Equity Incentive Plan permits the Board to grant stock options
to each  non-employee  director.  No more than  600,000  shares may be issued  under this
 plan.  In 2002,  we granted 42,500 options to the non-employee  directors.  As of
 December 31, 2002,  177,345 shares were available for grant. The exercise  price of the
granted  options was equal to our stock’s  market  price on the grant date.  The options
generally may be exercised one year after the grant date, and they expire ten years after
the grant date.

In March  1998,  the Board  adopted
 the SCP Pool  Corporation  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan.  Under  this plan, employees
who meet minimum age and length of service requirements may purchase stock at 85% of the
lower of:

The  closing  price  of our  common  stock at the end of a six  month  period  ending  either  June 30  or
     December 31; or

The average of the beginning and ending closing prices of our common stock for such six month period.

additional income tax expense of approximately $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2001.

Additionally,  we wrote-off
 approximately  $0.2 million  of capitalized  financing  costs in the fourth quarter of
2001 when we replaced the Senior Loan Facility one year prior to the maturity date.
