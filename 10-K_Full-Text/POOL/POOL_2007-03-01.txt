Business

General

Based
      on
      industry data, Pool Corporation (the

Company

,
      which
      may be referred to as

POOL,
      we, us

or

our

)
      is the
      world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and
      related leisure products. The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware
      in 1993 under the name SCP Holding Corporation, and in 1995 changed its name
      to
      SCP Pool Corporation. In 2006, the Company changed its name to Pool Corporation.
      This change acknowledges the Company’s growth from a regional distributor to a
      multi-national, multi-network distribution company

.

Our
      industry is highly fragmented, and as such, we add considerable value to the
      industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then
      distributing the products and offering a range of services to our customer
      base
      on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on
      their
      own.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006 we operated 274 sales centers in North America and Europe.

Our
      Industry

We
      believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young, with room for
      continued growth from increased penetration of new pools. Of the approximately
      70 million homes in the United States that have the economic capacity and
      the yard space to have a swimming pool, approximately 12% own a pool. Based
      upon
      industry data, we believe the industry has grown at a 2 to 6% annual rate for
      the past several years. Higher rates of new home construction over the last
      years, particularly in larger pool markets, have added to the market expansion
      opportunity for pool ownership.

We
      believe the swimming pool industry will continue to grow at a rate of
      approximately 2 to 6% annually over the next five years, primarily because
      of
      favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends, as well as the expected
      continued long-term growth in housing starts in warmer markets due to the
      population migration towards the south and the need to maintain the growing
      installed base of pools. We expect our sales growth to be higher than the
      industry average due to increases in market share and expansion of our product
      offerings.

We
      believe that new pool and irrigation system starts are also impacted to some
      extent by general economic conditions (as commonly measured by Gross Domestic
      Product or GDP) as well as certain housing market trends. Positive GDP trends
      may have a favorable impact on industry starts, while negative trends may be
      unfavorable for industry starts. We believe there may be some correlation
      between industry starts and the rate of housing turnover and home appreciation
      over time, with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive
      impact on starts over time. We also believe that any cyclicality in housing
      starts, like the slowdown in new home construction that began in 2006, will
      have
      a limited impact on our growth as most pools, approximately 80-90%, are built
      after a home is constructed.

A
      large
      portion of consumer spending in our industry is derived from the maintenance
      of
      existing swimming pools, including the repair and replacement of the equipment
      for those pools. We believe that consumer demand for qualified pool
      builders in many markets will continue to exceed the supply, which, along with
      the recurring nature of the repair and replacement market, has helped maintain
      a
      relatively consistent rate of industry growth historically.

The
      demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership
      including relaxation, entertainment, family activity, exercise and convenience.
      The industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer
      purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling, boats, motorcycles,
      recreational vehicles and vacations.


The
      industry has been positively impacted by the trend for increased homeowner
      spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment.
      Additionally, the developing trend in recent years is for consumers to bundle
      the purchase of a pool with other products as part of a complete backyard
      makeover. New irrigation systems and landscaping are often key components to
      completing a swimming pool installation or remodel. The irrigation and landscape
      market has many characteristics in common with the pool industry, and we believe
      that it benefits from the same favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends
      and will realize growth rates similar to the pool industry.

Our
      industry is seasonal, and weather is the principal external factor which affects
      our business. Peak industry activity occurs during the warmest months of the
      year, typically April through September. The industry is also affected by other
      factors including consumer saving and discretionary spending levels, the
      increase in pool eligible households and consumer attitudes toward pool and
      landscape products for environmental or safety reasons.

Business
      Strategy and Growth

Our
      mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers, in
      order
      to provide exceptional return to our shareholders while providing exceptional
      opportunities to our employees. Our three core strategies are to promote the
      growth of our industry, to promote the growth of our customers’ businesses and
      to continuously strive to operate more effectively.

We
      promote the growth of the industry through various advertising and promotional
      programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability
      of pool ownership, the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which
      a
      pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming. These programs
      include media advertising, industry-oriented website development such as

www.swimmingpool.com

™

and
      public relations campaigns. We use these programs as tools to educate consumers
      and lead prospective pool owners to our customers.

We
      promote the growth of our customers’ businesses through comprehensive support
      programs that offer promotional tools and marketing support to help generate
      increased sales for our customers. Our uniquely tailored programs include such
      features as customer lead generation, personalized websites, brochures,
      marketing campaigns and business development training. As a customer service,
      we
      also provide certain retail store customers assistance with everything from
      site
      selection to store layout and design to business management system
      implementation.

We
      strive
      to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our
      operations such as product sourcing, procurement and logistics initiatives,
      adoption of enhanced business practices and improved working capital management.

In
      addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth, we have increased
      our product breadth, as described in the “Customers and Products” section below,
      and expanded our sales center network through acquisitions and new sales center
      openings.

We
      have
      grown organically through increases in base business sales of 10% in 2006,
      14%
      in 2005 and 10% in 2004. Since 2002, we have opened 32 new sales centers.
      Acquisitions have historically been an important source of sales growth as
      well,
      and since 2002, we have successfully completed 11 acquisitions, consisting
      of 72
      sales centers (net of sales center closings and consolidations).

In
      August
      2006, we acquired a total of 14 sales centers through our acquisition of
      Wickham. For additional discussion of our recent acquisitions, see Note 2 of
      “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” included in Item 8 of this Form
      10-K. We intend to pursue additional strategic acquisitions, which will allow
      us
      to further penetrate existing markets and expand into new geographic markets
      and
      product categories.


Customers
      and Products

We
      serve
      roughly 70,000 customers, none of which account for more than 1% of our sales.
      We primarily serve five types of customers:

·

swimming
                pool remodelers and builders;

·

retail
                swimming pool stores;

·

swimming
                pool repair and service businesses;

·

landscape
                construction and maintenance contractors;
                and

·

golf
                courses.

The
      majority of these customers are small, family owned businesses with relatively
      limited capital resources.

We
      conduct our operations through 274 sales centers in North America and Europe.
      Our primary markets, which have the highest concentration of swimming pools,
      are
      California, Florida, Texas and Arizona, representing approximately 56% of our
      net sales in 2006. We use a combination of local and international sales and
      marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and
      strengthen our customers’ businesses. Our sales and marketing personnel focus on
      developing customer programs and promotional activities, creating and enhancing
      sales management tools and providing product and market expertise. Our local
      sales personnel work from the sales centers and are charged with understanding
      and meeting our customers’ specific needs.

We
      offer
      our customers more than 100,000 national brand and private label products.
      We
      believe that our selection of pool equipment and supplies, chemicals,
      replacement parts and complementary products is the most comprehensive in the
      industry. The products we sell can be categorized as follows:

·

maintenance products such as chemicals, supplies and pool
                accessories;

·

repair and replacement parts for cleaners, filters, heaters, pumps
                and
                lights;

·

packaged pool kits including walls, liners, bracing, filters, heaters,
                pumps and coping for in-ground and above-ground
                pools;

·

pool equipment and materials for new pool construction and the remodeling
                of existing pools; and

·

complementary products, including:

­

-
                construction materials used for pool installations and remodeling,
                such as
                concrete, plumbing and electrical components and pool surface and
                decking
                materials;

­

-
                irrigation and landscape products, including professional lawn care
                equipment; and

­

-
                other discretionary recreational and related outdoor lifestyle products
                that enhance consumers use and enjoyment of outdoor living
                spaces.

Maintenance
      products and repair and replacement parts are non-discretionary in nature,
      meaning that these items must be purchased by end-users to maintain existing
      swimming pools and landscaped areas. Over 60% of our gross profits are derived
      from the sale of products used to maintain and repair these existing features
      and less than 40% are derived from the construction and installation (equipment,
      materials, plumbing, electrical, etc.) of new pools and landscaping. We
      distribute irrigation and landscape products through our Horizon Distributors
      (Horizon) network , which we acquired through acquisitions in 2005 and
      2006.

Our
      complementary product sales grew 26% in 2006 and accounted for over 9% of our
      total net sales at comparable margins to our traditional product offerings.
      This
      growth has been an important factor in our base business sales growth over
      the
      past seven years, with complementary product sales growing from approximately
      $3.0 million in 1999 to over $180.0 million in 2006.

We
      have
      identified other product categories that could become part of our complementary
      product offerings in the future. We typically introduce two to three categories
      each year in certain markets. We then evaluate the performance of these test
      categories and focus on those which we believe exhibit long-term growth
      potential. In 2007, we intend to continue to expand our complementary products
      initiative by increasing the number of locations which offer complementary
      products, increasing the number of complementary products offered at certain
      locations and continuing a modest broadening of the product offerings on a
      company-wide basis. We expect total complementary product sales to approximate
      10% of our total sales in 2007.


Operating
      Strategy

We
      operate three distribution networks: the SCP Distributors (SCP) network, the
      Superior Pool Products (Superior) network and the Horizon network. The SCP
      network consists of 152 sales centers, including 11 locations in Europe, the
      Superior network consists of 62 locations and the Horizon network consists
      of 60
      locations.

We
      distribute swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products
      through our SCP and Superior networks and we distribute irrigation and landscape
      products through our Horizon network. We adopted the strategy of operating
      two
      distinct distribution networks within the swimming pool marketplace primarily
      for two reasons:

1.

To
                offer our customers a choice of different distributors, featuring
                distinctive product selections and service personnel;
                and

2.

To
                increase the level of customer service and operational efficiency
                provided
                by the sales centers in each network by promoting healthy competition
                between the two networks.

We
      evaluate our sales centers based upon their performance relative to
      predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures.
      Our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services
      including customer and vendor related programs, information systems support
      and
      expert resources to help achieve their goals. We believe our incentive programs
      and feedback tools, along with the competitive nature of our internal networks,
      stimulate and enhance employee performance.

Distribution

Our
      sales
      centers are located near customer concentrations, typically in industrial,
      commercial or mixed-use zones. Customers may pick up products at any sales
      center location, or products may be delivered via our trucks or third party
      carriers.

Our
      sales
      centers maintain well-stocked inventories to meet customers’ immediate needs. We
      utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving, inventory
      control, picking, packing and shipping functions.

In
      addition, we operate five centralized shipping locations and five construction
      materials centers that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities
      to
      our sales centers or directly to customers.

Purchasing
      and Suppliers

We
      enjoy
      good relationships with our suppliers, who generally offer competitive pricing,
      return policies and promotional allowances. It is customary in our industry
      for
      manufacturers to seasonally offer extended payment terms to qualifying
      purchasers such as POOL. These terms are typically available to us for
      pre-season or early season purchases.

We
      initiated a preferred vendor program in 1999 which encourages our buyers to
      purchase products from a smaller number of vendors. We work closely with these
      vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our
      customers and concentrate our purchasing activities. These practices, together
      with a more comprehensive service offering, have resulted in improved margins
      at
      the sales center level.

We
      regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to
      assure competitive cost, service and quality standards. Our largest suppliers
      include Pentair Corporation, Hayward Pool Products, Inc. and Waterpik
      Technologies, Inc., which accounted for approximately 16%, 11% and 6%,
      respectively, of the cost of products we sold in 2006.


Competition

Based
      on
      industry knowledge and available data, management believes we are the largest
      wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products, and the
      only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry
      in the United States. We are also one of the top three distributors of landscape
      and irrigation products in the United States, and we compete against one
      national wholesale distributor of these products. We face intense competition
      from many regional and local distributors in our markets and to a lesser extent,
      mass-market retailers and large pool supply retailers with their own internal
      distribution networks.

Some
      geographic markets we serve, particularly our largest, higher density markets
      in
      California, Florida, Texas and Arizona, are more competitive than others.
      Barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low. We compete with other
      distributors for rights to distribute brand-name products. If we lose or are
      unable to obtain these rights, we might be materially and adversely affected.
      We
      believe that the size of our operations allows us to compete favorably for
      such
      distribution rights.

We
      believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and landscape
      supply distribution are:

·

the
              breadth and availability of products offered;

·

the quality and level of customer
                service;

·

the breadth and depth of sales and marketing programs;

·

consistency and stability of business relationships with customers;
                and

·

competitive product pricing.

We
      believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these
      factors.

Seasonality
      and Weather

For
      a
      discussion regarding seasonality and weather, see Item 7, “Management’s
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -
      Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations,” of this Form 10-K.

Environmental,
      Health and Safety Regulations

Our
      business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and international,
      federal, state and local environmental and health and safety requirements,
      including regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department
      of
      Transportation, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the National
      Fire Protection Agency and the International Maritime Organization. Most of
      these requirements govern the packaging, labeling, handling, transportation,
      storage and sale of pool chemicals and landscape chemicals and fertilizers.
      We
      store certain types of chemicals and/or fertilizers at each of our sales
      centers, and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire
      codes. In addition, we sell algaecides and pest control products that are
      regulated as pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide
      Act and various state pesticide laws. These laws are primarily related to
      labeling, annual registration and licensing.

Employees

We
      employed approximately 3,600 people at December 31, 2006. Given the seasonal
      nature of our business, our peak employment period is the summer, when we add
      up
      to 15% more employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand.


Intellectual
      Property

We
      maintain both domestic and foreign registered trademarks primarily for our
      private label products that are important to our current and future business
      operations. We also own rights to several Internet domain names.

      is the principal external factor affecting our business. For example,
      unseasonably late warming trends in the spring or early cooling trends in the
      fall can decrease the length of the pool season. Also, unseasonably cool weather
      or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool
      use,
      installation and maintenance, as well as landscape installations and
      maintenance. These weather conditions adversely affect sales of our products.
      For a discussion regarding seasonality and weather, see Item 7, “Management’s
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -
      Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations,” of this Form 10-K.

Our
      distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable
      relationships with suppliers.

As
      a
      distribution company, maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers
      is
      critical to the success of our business. We believe that we add considerable
      value to the swimming pool supply chain and landscape supply chain by purchasing
      products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products
      to a
      highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than
      these
      customers could obtain on their own. We believe that we currently enjoy good
      relationships with our suppliers, who generally offer us competitive pricing,
      return policies and promotional allowances. However, our inability to maintain
      favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on
      our
      business.

Our
      largest suppliers are Pentair Corporation, Hayward Pool Products, Inc. and
      Waterpik Technologies, Inc., which accounted for approximately 16%, 11% and
      6%,
      respectively, of the costs of products we sold in 2006. A decision by several
      suppliers, acting in concert, to sell their products directly to retail
      customers and other end-users of their products, bypassing distribution
      companies like ours, would have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally,
      the loss of a single supplier could also adversely affect our business. We
      dedicate significant resources to promote the benefits and affordability of
      pool
      ownership, which we believe greatly benefits our swimming pool customers and
      suppliers.

We
      face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure
      product alternatives.

We
      face
      competition from both inside and outside of our industry. Within our industry,
      we compete against various regional and local distributors and, to a lesser
      extent, mass market retailers and large pool or landscape supply retailers.
      Outside of our industry, we compete with sellers of other leisure product
      alternatives, such as boats and motor homes, and with other companies who rely
      on discretionary homeowner expenditures, such as home remodelers. New
      competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry.
      Some
      geographic markets that we serve, particularly our largest, higher density
      markets in California, Florida, Texas and Arizona, representing approximately
      56% of our net sales in 2006, also tend to be more competitive than others.

More
      aggressive competition by mass merchants and large pool or landscape supply
      retailers could adversely affect our sales.

Mass market
      retailers today carry a limited range of, and devote a limited amount of
      shelf space to, merchandise and products targeted to our industry. Historically,
      mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and
      product breadth, but their product offering of pool and landscape related
      products has remained relatively constant.  Should mass market
      retailers increase their focus on the pool or professional landscape industries,
      or increase the breadth of their pool and landscape related product offerings,
      they may become a more significant competitor for direct and
      end-use customers which could have an adverse impact on our business. We
      may face additional competitive pressures if large pool or landscape supply
      retailers look to expand their customer base to compete more directly within
      the
      distribution channel.


The
      demand for our swimming pool and related outdoor lifestyle products may be
      adversely affected by

unfavorable
      economic conditions.

In
      economic downturns, the demand for swimming pool or leisure related products
      may
      decline as discretionary consumer spending, the increase in pool eligible
      households and swimming pool construction decline.  Although maintenance
      products and repair and replacement equipment that must be purchased by pool
      owners to maintain existing swimming pools account for more than 60% of our
      gross profits, the growth of our business depends on the expansion of the
      installed pool base, which may be viewed by most consumers as a discretionary
      expenditure that could be adversely affected by economic downturns. 
In addition, even in generally favorable economic conditions, severe and/or
      prolonged downturns in the housing market could have a material adverse impact
      on our financial performance.

We
      depend on key personnel.

We
      consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success. As
      such,
      our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain
      and
      motivate qualified personnel, including our executive officers and key
      management personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel,
      our
      operating results could be adversely affected.

Specifically,
      our future success depends to an extent upon the continued service of Manuel
      Perez de la Mesa, our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of Mr. Perez de la
      Mesa
      in particular could have a material adverse effect on our business. Mr. Perez
      de
      la Mesa is not nearing retirement age, and we have no indication that he intends
      to retire in the near future. We do not currently maintain key man insurance
      on
      Mr. Perez de la Mesa.

We
      may not be able to sustain our pace of growth.

We
      have
      experienced substantial sales growth in recent years through acquisitions and
      new sales center openings that have increased our size, scope and geographic
      distribution. Since 2002, we have opened 32 new sales centers and have completed
      11 acquisitions. These acquisitions have added 72 sales centers, net of sales
      center closings and consolidations, and a centralized shipping location to
      our
      distribution networks. While we contemplate continued growth through
      acquisitions and internal expansion, no assurance can be made as to our ability
      to:

·

penetrate
                new markets;

·

identify
                appropriate acquisition candidates;

·

complete
                acquisitions on satisfactory terms and successfully integrate acquired
                businesses;

·

obtain
                financing;

·

generate
                sufficient cash flows to support expansion plans and general operating
                activities;

·

maintain
                favorable supplier arrangements and relationships; and

·

identify
                and divest assets which do not continue to create value consistent
                with
                our objectives.

If
      we do
      not manage these potential difficulties successfully, our operating results
      could be adversely affected.

The
      growth of our business depends on effective marketing programs.

The
      growth of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base.
      Thus, an important part of our strategy is to promote the growth of the pool
      industry through our extensive advertising and promotional programs that attempt
      to raise consumer awareness regarding the benefits and affordability of pool
      ownership, the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool may
      be
      enjoyed beyond swimming. These programs include media advertising, website
      development such as

www.swimmingpool.com

™

and
      public relations campaigns. We believe these programs benefit the entire supply
      chain from our suppliers to our customers.

We
      also
      promote the growth of our customers’ businesses through comprehensive support
      programs that offer promotional tools and marketing support to help generate
      increased sales for our customers. Our programs include such things as
      personalized websites, brochures, marketing campaigns and business development
      training. We also provide certain retail store customers with assistance in
      site
      selection, store layout and design and business management system
      implementation. Our inability to sufficiently develop effective advertising,
      marketing and promotional programs to succeed in a weakened economic environment
      and an increasingly competitive marketplace, in which we (and our entire supply
      chain) also compete with other luxury product alternatives, could have a
      material adverse effect on our business.


Our
      business is highly seasonal.

In
      2006,
      approximately 65% of our net sales and 93% of our operating income were
      generated in the second and third quarters of the year, which represent the
      peak
      months of swimming pool use, installation, remodeling and repair. Our sales
      are
      substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year, when
      we
      may incur net losses.

The
      nature of our business subjects us to compliance with Environmental, Health,
      Transportation and Safety Regulations.

We
      are
      subject to regulation under federal, state and local environmental, health,
      transportation and safety requirements, which govern such things as packaging,
      labeling, handling, transportation, storage and sale of pool chemicals and
      landscape chemicals and fertilizers. For example, we sell algaecides and pest
      control products that are regulated as pesticides under the Federal Insecticide,
      Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and various state pesticide laws. These laws
      are
      primarily related to labeling, annual registration and licensing.

Failure
      to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of
      administrative, civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive
      relief. Moreover, compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could
      prove to be costly, and there can be no assurance that we will not incur such
      costs in material amounts. These laws and regulations have changed substantially
      and rapidly over the last 20 years, and we anticipate that there will be
      continuing changes. The clear trend in environmental, health, transportation
      and
      safety regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities
      that impact the environment, such as the use and handling of chemical
      substances. Increasingly, strict restrictions and limitations have resulted
      in
      increased operating costs for us, and it is possible that the costs of
      compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase. We will
      attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed
      and
      we will plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing regulations
      and
      to minimize the costs of such compliance.

We
      store chemicals, fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire,
      safety and casualty risks.

We
      store
      chemicals and fertilizers, including certain combustible, oxidizing compounds,
      at our sales centers. A fire, explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities
      could give rise to fire, safety and casualty losses and related liability
      claims. We maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection. However,
      we
      cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future
      claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance
      in
      the future at rates we consider reasonable. Successful claims for which we
      are
      not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability.
      In
      addition, changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher
      insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage.

We
      conduct business internationally, which exposes us to additional risks.

Our
      international operations expose us to certain additional risks,
      including:

·

difficulty
                in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary
                operations;

·

uncertain
                political and regulatory
                conditions;

·

foreign
                currency fluctuations;

·

adverse
                tax consequences; and

·

dependence
                on foreign economies.

We
      source
      certain products we sell, including our private label products, from Asia and
      other foreign locations. There is a significant risk that we may not be able
      to
      access products in a timely and efficient manner, and we may also be subject
      to
      certain trade restrictions that prevent us from obtaining products. Fluctuations
      in other factors relating to foreign trade, such as tariffs, currency exchange
      rates, transportation costs and inflation are beyond our control.


A
      terrorist attack or the threat of a terrorist attack could have a material
      adverse effect on our business.

The
      terrorist attacks that took place on September 11, 2001, in the U.S. were
      unprecedented events that have created many economic and political
      uncertainties, some of which may materially impact our business. Discretionary
      spending on leisure products such as ours is generally adversely affected during
      times of economic uncertainty. The potential for future terrorist attacks,
      the
      national and international responses to terrorist attacks, and other acts of
      war
      or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties, which
      could
      adversely affect our business for the short or long-term in ways that cannot
      presently be predicted.

Properties

We
      lease
      the POOL corporate offices, which consist of approximately 50,000 square feet
      of
      office space in Covington, Louisiana, from an entity in which we have a 50%
      ownership interest. We own three sales centers in Florida. All of our other
      properties are leased for terms that expire between 2007 and 2027. Generally,
      our sales center leases have three to seven year terms with only seven leases
      expiring beyond 2017. Most of our leases contain renewal options, some of which
      involve rent increases. In addition to minimum rental payments, which are set
      at
      competitive rates, certain leases require reimbursement for taxes, maintenance
      and insurance.

Our
      sales
      centers range in size from approximately 2,000 square feet to 100,000 square
      feet and generally consist of warehouse, counter, display and office space.
      Our
      centralized shipping locations and construction materials centers range in
      size
      from 16,000 square feet to 132,000 square feet.

We
      believe that our facilities are well maintained, suitable for our business
      and
      occupy sufficient space to meet our operating needs. As part of our normal
      business, we regularly evaluate sales center performance and site suitability
      and may relocate a sales center or consolidate two locations if a sales center
      is redundant in a market, under performing or otherwise deemed unsuitable.
      We do
      not believe that any single lease is material to our operations.

      contract and employment matters.  While the outcome of any litigation is
      inherently unpredictable, we do not believe, based on currently available facts,

      adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash

      of Equity Securities

Our
      common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol
      “POOL”. On February 20, 2007, there were approximately 31,270
      beneficial holders of our common stock. The table below sets forth the high
      and
      low sales prices of our common stock as well as dividends declared for each
      quarter during the last two fiscal years.

We
      initiated quarterly dividend payments to our shareholders in the second quarter
      of 2004, and we have continued payments in each subsequent quarter. Our Board
      of
      Directors (our Board) has increased the dividend amount three times including
      in
      the fourth quarter of 2004, the second quarter of 2005 and the second quarter
      of
      2006. Payment of future dividends will be at the

discretion of our Board, after taking into account various factors, including
      earnings, capital requirements and surplus, financial position, contractual
      restrictions and other relevant business considerations. We plan to continue
      to
      pay quarterly dividends, but there can be no assurance that dividends will
      be
      declared or paid any time in the future if our Board deems that there is a
      better use of those funds.

In
                July 2002, our Board authorized $50.0 million for the repurchase
                of shares
                of our common stock in the open market. In August 2004, November
                2005 and
                August 2006, our Board increased the authorization for the repurchase
                of
                shares of our common stock in the open market to a total of
                $50.0 million from the amounts remaining at each of those dates. In
                November 2006, when approximately $4.1 million of the existing authorized
                amount remained available for share repurchases, our Board increased
                the
                authorization for the repurchase of shares of our common stock in
                the open

(4)

The
      approximate 51% increase in working capital from 2004 to 2005 is due primarily
      to a greater amount of early buy inventory purchases that we made and received
      during the fourth quarter of 2005 and the Horizon acquisition. This increase
      was
      partially offset by the deferral of our third and fourth quarter 2005 estimated
      federal income tax payments. For further discussion, see the “LIQUIDITY AND
      CAPITAL RESOURCES” section included in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

The
      approximate 58% decrease in working capital from 2002 to 2003 is due to the
      classification of our former revolving line of credit balance and the addition
      of short-term financing. Since this revolving line of credit expired in November
      2004, the outstanding balance at December 31, 2003 was classified as current.
      The accounts receivable securitization facility that we entered into in 2003
      is
      also classified as current.

Item

Management’s
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations

      FINANCIAL OVERVIEW

Financial
      Results

Our
      financial results reflect another year of strong growth. Net sales increased
      23%
      in 2006 to $1.9 billion due to $204.7 million of sales growth related to
      acquired sales centers and $152.4 million of sales growth from our base
      business. The 10% base business sales growth reflects the continued growth
      in
      the installed base of swimming pools, market share gains through our execution
      of sales, marketing and service programs that we offer to our customers,
      inflationary price increases

passed
      through the supply chain, 26% growth in complementary product sales and sales
      from new locations.

We
      believe the impact of weather on sales in 2006 was mixed, with a favorable
      sales
      impact from near record high temperatures throughout much of the year across
      North America and negative sales impacts due to record precipitation in the
      northeast and much colder than average August and September temperatures which
      shortened the pool season in certain markets.

Gross
      profit increased 25% in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to the increase
      in
      net sales. Our gross profit as a percentage of net sales (gross margin)
      increased 40 basis points to 28.3% in 2006. The majority of this increase
      was attributable to the benefits achieved through our supply chain management
      initiatives, including our pre-price increase inventory purchases in the fourth
      quarter of 2005 and second quarter of 2006. Gross margin also benefited from
      higher margin contributions from our acquired businesses and a slight shift
      in
      product mix to higher margin products. These margin improvements were partially
      offset by a reduction in our earned vendor incentives as a percentage of total
      net sales.

Operating
      expenses in 2006 increased 25% compared to 2005. This increase was higher than
      our 2006 sales growth rate due to higher expense ratios for our recently
      acquired businesses, start-up costs and higher expense ratios for the 17 new
      sales centers we opened in 2006 and expenses for other investments that expanded
      our sales center locations and value-added programs. Examples of new programs
      that we launched in 2006 include a new branded retail customer program called
      The Backyard Place and a new pool financing brokerage business that enhances
      our
      swimming pool builder programs.

Our
      operating income increased 24% in 2006 while our operating margin increased
      slightly to 8.8% of net sales from 8.7% in 2005. Interest expense increased
      136%
      in 2006 due to higher debt levels for borrowings to fund share repurchases
      and
      acquisitions and a higher average effective interest rate compared to 2005.
      Net
      income increased 18% to $95.0 million compared to the same period in 2005 and
      included $1.6 million of net equity earnings from our investment in Latham
      Acquisition Corporation (LAC).

Financial
      Position and Liquidity

Cash
      provided by operations increased $29.6 million to $69.0 million in 2006 due
      primarily to the increase in net income compared to 2005 and the impact related
      to our fourth quarter 2005 early buy purchases. In 2005, our cash provided
      by
      operations was negatively impacted by early buy inventory purchases that we
      received and paid for in the fourth quarter of 2005. This impact is reflected
      in
      the net change in our inventory and accounts payable balances between periods,
      but the benefit to our 2006 cash provided by operations was largely offset
      by
      the decrease in accrued expenses which included a $27.0 million payment for
      estimated federal tax payments that were deferred from the second half of 2005
      as allowed by the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005.

Coupled
      with net proceeds from other financing activities of approximately $90.6
      million, cash provided by operations helped fund the following in
      2006:

·

share
                repurchases of $111.1 million, including $103.3 million of open market
                repurchases under our Board authorized repurchase
                plan;

·

our
                acquisition of Wickham in August
                2006;

·

the
                payment of our quarterly cash dividends to shareholders, which we
                increased in the second quarter of 2006;

·

capital
                expenditures of $14.9 million; and

·

financing
                of $10.0 to $15.0 million in working capital for our 17 new locations
                opened in 2006.


Our
      accounts receivable balance increased 9% to $154.9 million at December 31,
      2006,
      including receivables related to the Wickham acquisition. Days sales outstanding
      (DSO) increased between periods to 35.9 days at December 31, 2006
      compared to 33.6 days at December 31, 2005 as a result of the addition
      of Horizon’s receivables, which have slightly longer collection cycles. Since
      our DSO calculation is based on trailing 12 month net sales, Horizon’s
      receivables are not included in the 2005 calculation. Excluding Horizon from
      the
      2006 calculation, DSO improved slightly to 33.1 days. Our allowance for doubtful
      accounts increased to $4.9 million at December 31, 2006 from $4.2
      million at December 31, 2005. This increase reflects the higher receivables
      balance and a slight increase in our past due receivable balances as a
      percentage of total receivables.

Our
      net
      inventory balance increased $1.5 million to $332.1 million at December 31,
      2006.
      The December 31, 2005 inventory balance included approximately $53.0
      million of early buy inventory purchases that we received and paid for in the
      fourth quarter of 2005 to take advantage of vendor price discounts. Since we
      did
      not receive any significant early buy inventory during the fourth quarter of
      2006, the December 31, 2006 balance reflects increases of $13.9
      million for our 17 new sales centers, $8.5 million related to Wickham, and
      $32.1
      million related to growth of our business and some product line expansion for
      construction materials and other complementary products. Inventory turns, as
      calculated on a trailing 12 month basis, have slowed to 3.9 times
      in 2006 from 4.3 times in 2005 due primarily to our significant
      pre-price increase inventory purchases.

Total
      debt outstanding increased to $265.4 million at December 31, 2006 compared
      to $194.8 million at December 31, 2005. This increase is attributable to
      increased borrowings to fund our 2006 share repurchases, our acquisition of
      Wickham and slightly higher working capital levels. We continue to maintain
      a
      healthy current ratio, which increased to 1.8 as of December 31, 2006
      compared to 1.6 as of December 31, 2005.

Recent
      Developments

Recent
      economic trends include a slowdown in the domestic housing market, with a sharp
      drop in new home construction and home value deflation in many markets, and
      increases in short-term interest rates.  Some of the factors that have
      mitigated the impact of these trends on our business include the
      following:

·

the
                majority of our business is driven by recurring sales related to
                the
                ongoing maintenance and repair of existing pools and landscaped areas,
                with less than 40% of our sales tied to new pool or irrigation
                construction;

·

we
                estimate that only 10% to 20% of new pools are constructed along
                with new
                home construction; and

·

we
                have a low market share with the largest pool builders who we believe
                are
                more heavily tied to new home
                construction.

However,
      a more severe and/or prolonged housing market slowdown may have a more direct
      impact on new pool construction that could negatively impact our
      sales.

OUTLOOK

We
      believe that the following factors will contribute to net sales growth in
      2007:

·

sales
                expansion at our existing sales centers
                through:

­

continued
                execution of our sales, marketing and service programs;

­

the
                continued growth of the installed base of swimming pools;

­

growth
                in complementary product sales; and

­

a
                full year of sales from the 17 new sales centers opened in
                2006.

·

sales
                from acquired sales centers;

·

expected
                product price increases of 1% to 2% passed through the supply chain;
                and

·

the
                anticipated opening of approximately 10 or 11 new sales centers in
                2007.

In
      2007,
      we expect to realize more sales growth relative to 2006 as the year unfolds
      based on tougher sales comparisons in the first half of the year. We believe
      that complementary products will continue to grow at a faster rate than our
      overall sales growth.


We
      believe that gross margins will improve slightly in 2007. However, we expect
      that our 2007 quarterly gross margins will be comparatively lower to 2006 in
      the
      first three quarters and higher in the fourth quarter due the benefits of our
      aggressive pre-price increase early buys in the first three quarters of 2006
      and
      to our third and fourth quarter 2006 vendor incentive adjustments. The changes
      in our earned incentive estimates were recorded as cumulative catch-up
      adjustments to the amounts recognized in our 2006 financial statements at the
      time of the adjustments.

We
      expect
      to continue to increase our focus on supply chain management initiatives,
      including further expansion of international sourcing and private label
      opportunities, particularly where margin expansion opportunities exist. We
      also
      plan to make further advances in working capital management to achieve continued
      operational improvements in 2007 and beyond.

We
      expect
      a positive contribution from equity earnings from our investment in LAC in
      2007.
      LAC’s business is highly seasonal and more heavily weighted to northern markets,
      with the first and fourth quarters being the slowest parts of the year and
      the
      second and third quarters being the busiest.

We
      project that 2007 earnings per share will be in the range of $2.00 to $2.10
      per
      diluted share, which represents our long term guidance of 15% organic earnings
      per share growth plus the accretive benefits of already completed acquisitions
      and share repurchases. This range includes an expected $0.09 impact from stock
      option expensing.

Generally,
      execution is the primary overall factor affecting the Company’s results and
      weather is the most significant external factor. We believe that over the long
      term, we will generate sufficient cash flow and have adequate access to capital
      to both fund our business objectives and provide a direct return to our
      shareholders in the form of dividend payments.

Our
      business is subject to significant risks, including weather, competition,
      general economic conditions and other risks as detailed in Item 1A of this
      Form
      10-K.


CRITICAL
      ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

We
      prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
      accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management to make
      estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.
      Management identifies critical accounting estimates as:

·

those
                that require the use of assumptions about matters that are inherently
                and
                highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made;
                and

·

those
                for which changes in the estimate or assumptions, or the use of different
                estimates and assumptions, could have a material impact on our
                consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Management
      has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of our critical
      accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board. We believe the
      following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult,
      subjective or complex judgments.

Allowance
      for Doubtful Accounts

We
      maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for an estimate of the losses we
      will incur if our customers do not make required payments. We perform periodic
      credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral.
      Consistent with industry practices, we require payment from our customers within
      30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended
      payment terms to qualified customers. The extended terms require payments in
      equal installments in April, May and June or May and June, depending on
      geographical location. In the past, credit losses have been within or better
      than our expectations.

As
      our
      business is seasonal, our customers’ businesses are also seasonal. Sales are
      lowest in the winter months, and our past due accounts receivable balance as
      a
      percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time. We provide
      reserves for uncollectible accounts based on the accounts receivable aging
      ranging from 0.1% for amounts currently due up to 100% for specific accounts
      more than 60 days past due.

At
      the
      end of each year, we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with past due
      balances greater than $25,000. Additionally, we perform a separate reserve
      analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on the
      remainder of the past due portion of the aging. As we review these past due
      accounts, we evaluate collectibility based on a combination of factors,
      including:

·

aging
                statistics and trends;

·

customer
                payment history;

·

independent
                credit reports; and

·

discussions
                with customers.

During
      the year, we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable
      collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote.
      Such write-offs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts. In
      the
      past five years, write-offs have averaged less than 0.2% of net
      sales.

If
      the
      balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by 20% at
      December 31, 2006, pretax income would change by approximately
      $0.6 million and earnings per share would change by approximately $0.01 per
      diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at
      December 31, 2006.


Inventory
      Obsolescence

Product
      inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet. Our goal is to
      manage our inventory such that we minimize stock-outs to provide the highest
      level of service to our customers. To do this, we maintain at each sales center
      an adequate inventory of stock keeping units (SKUs) with the highest sales
      volume. At the same time, we continuously strive to better manage our slower
      moving classes of inventory, which are not as critical to our customers and
      thus, inherently have lower velocity. Sales centers classify products into
      classes based on sales at that location over the past 12 months. All inventory
      is included in these classes, except for non-stock special order items and
      products with less than 12 months of usage. The table below presents a
      description of these inventory classes:

There
      is
      little risk of obsolescence for products in classes 1-4 because products in
      these classes generally turn quickly. We establish our reserve for inventory
      obsolescence based on inventory classes 5-13, which we believe represent some
      exposure to inventory obsolescence, with particular emphasis on SKUs with the
      least sales over the previous 12 months. The reserve is intended to reflect
      the
      value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit. We provide
      a
      reserve of 5% for inventory in classes 5-13 and non-stock inventory as
      determined at the sales center level. We also provide an additional 5% reserve
      for excess inventory in classes 5-12 and an additional 45% reserve for excess
      inventory in class 13. We determine excess inventory, which is defined as the
      amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous 12 months usage, on a
      company-wide basis.

In
      evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence, we consider
      a
      combination of factors including:

·

the
                level of inventory in relationship to historical sales by product,
                including inventory usage by class based on product sales at both
                the
                sales center and Company levels;

·

changes
                in customer preferences;

·

seasonal
                fluctuations in inventory levels;

·

geographical
                location; and

·

new
                product offerings.

Our
      reserve for inventory obsolescence may periodically require adjustment as
      changes occur in the above-identified factors.

If
      the
      balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by 20% at
      December 31, 2006, pretax income would change by approximately
      $0.5 million and earnings per share would change by approximately $0.01 per
      diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at
      December 31, 2006.

Vendor
      Incentives

We
      account for vendor incentives in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force
      Issue 02-16,

Accounting
      by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from
      a
      Vendor.

Many
      of
      our vendor arrangements provide for us to receive incentives of specified
      amounts of consideration, payable to us when we achieve any of a number of
      measures. These measures are generally related to the volume level of purchases
      from our vendors and may include negotiated pricing arrangements. We account
      for
      such incentives as if they are a reduction of the prices of the vendor’s
      products and therefore as a reduction of inventory until we sell the product,
      at
      which time such incentives reduce cost of sales in our income statement.


Throughout
      the year, we estimate the amount of the incentive earned based on our estimate
      of cumulative purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels
      that
      mark our progress toward earning the incentives. We accrue vendor incentives
      on
      a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are
      probable and reasonably estimable. Our estimates for cumulative purchases and
      sales of qualifying products are driven by our sales projections, which can
      be
      significantly impacted by a number of external factors including weather and
      changes in economic conditions. Changes in our purchasing mix also impact our
      incentive estimates, as incentive rates can vary depending on our volume of
      purchases from specific vendors. We continually revise these estimates
      throughout the year to reflect actual purchase levels and trends. As a result,
      our estimated quarterly vendor incentive accruals may include cumulative
      catch-up adjustments to reflect any changes in our estimates between reporting
      periods.

If
      market
      conditions were to change, vendors may change the terms of some or all of these
      programs. Although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded
      related to product already purchased, they may lower or raise our gross margins
      for products sold in future periods.

Income
      Taxes

We
      record
      deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between the financial
      reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates
      and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse.
      Due
      to changing tax laws and state income tax rates, significant judgment is
      required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences
      that are expected to reverse in the future.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, and in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting
      Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 109,

Accounting
      for Income Taxes

,
      United
      States taxes were not provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign
      subsidiaries, as we have invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings
      indefinitely. If in the future these earnings are repatriated to the United
      States, or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable
      future, additional tax provisions may be required.

We
      hold,
      through our wholly owned affiliates, cash balances in the countries in which
      we
      operate, including substantial amounts held outside the United States. Most
      of
      the amounts held outside the United States could be repatriated to the United
      States, but, under current law, may be subject to United States federal income
      taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Repatriation of some foreign
      balances is restricted by local laws including the imposition of withholding
      taxes in some jurisdictions.

We
      have
      operations in 39 states and seven foreign countries. The amount of income taxes
      we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities. We are
      subject to regular audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our
      estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly
      judgmental. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably
      foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may
      include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities
      in
      the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation
      on potential assessments expire. These adjustments may include differences
      between the estimated deferred tax liability that we have recorded for equity
      earnings in unconsolidated investments and the actual taxes paid upon the return
      of undistributed equity earnings through a manner other than a capital
      transaction. As a result of these uncertainties, our total income tax provision
      may fluctuate on a quarterly basis.

In
      June
      2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No.(FIN) 48,

Accounting
      for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

,

an
      interpretation of SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes

,
      to
      create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions.
      We
      adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007, as required, and are currently in
      the
      process of implementing the provisions of the interpretation. The cumulative
      impact of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded in retained earnings. We anticipate
      that the accounting under the provisions of FIN 48 may provide for greater
      volatility in our effective tax rate as items are derecognized or as we record
      changes in measurement in interim periods.

Incentive
      Compensation Accrual

We
      have
      an incentive compensation structure designed to attract, motivate and retain
      employees. Our incentive compensation packages include bonus plans that are
      specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas
      of
      responsibility. The majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that
      are based primarily on objective performance criteria, with a component based
      on
      management’s discretion. We calculate bonuses as a percentage of salaries based
      on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results,
      including budgeted operating income and diluted earnings per share. We generally
      make bonus payments at the end of February following the most recent completed
      fiscal year.


The
      objectives for our bonus plans are set at the inception of the bonus plan year
      using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for
      the
      current plan year. The Compensation Committee of our Board approves these
      objectives for certain bonus plans. We record an incentive compensation accrual
      at the end of each month using management’s estimate of the total overall
      incentives earned based on the amount of progress achieved towards the stated
      bonus plan objectives. During the third and fourth quarters and as of our fiscal
      year end, we adjust our estimated incentive compensation accrual based on our
      detailed analysis of each bonus plan, the participants’ progress toward
      achievement of their specific bonus plan objectives and management’s estimates
      related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans. Due to both the
      discretionary components of the bonus plans and the timing of the approval
      and
      payment of the annual bonuses, our estimated quarterly incentive compensation
      expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense
      and payouts.

Intangible
      Assets

Our
      largest intangible asset is goodwill. At December 31, 2006, our
      goodwill balance was $154.2 million, representing 20% of total assets and 56%
      of
      stockholders’ equity. Goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to
      acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and
      identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed.

We
      account for goodwill under the provisions of SFAS 142,

Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets

.
      Under
      these rules, we test goodwill for impairment annually or at any other time
      when
      impairment indicators exist.

In
      October 2006, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test, which requires
      comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying
      value, including goodwill. As a result of this test, we believe the goodwill
      on
      our balance sheet is not impaired.

If
      circumstances change or events occur to indicate that our estimated fair value
      has fallen below carrying value, we will compare the estimated fair value of
      the
      goodwill to its carrying value. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the
      estimated fair value of goodwill, we will recognize the difference as an
      impairment loss in operating income.

RESULTS
      OF OPERATIONS

The
      table
      below summarizes information derived from our Consolidated Statements of Income
      expressed as a percentage of net sales for the past three fiscal
      years:

Note:

Due
                to rounding, percentages may not add to operating income or income
                before
                income taxes and equity earnings.


The
      following discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating
      results from acquisitions in 2006, 2005 and 2004. We accounted for these
      acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting, and we have included
      the
      results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective
      acquisition dates.

We
      exclude the following sales centers from base business for 15 months:

·

acquired
                sales centers;

·

sales
                centers divested or consolidated with acquired sales centers;
                and

·

new
                sales centers opened in new
                markets.

Additionally,
      we generally allocate overhead expenses to acquired sales centers on the basis
      of acquired sales center net sales as a percentage of total net
      sales.

Fiscal
      Year 2006 compared to Fiscal Year 2005

For
      purposes of comparing operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006
      to
      the year ended December 31, 2005, 210 sales centers were included in the base
      business calculations and 64 sales centers were excluded because they were
      acquired or opened in new markets within the last 15 months. The effect of
      sales
      center acquisitions in the table above includes the operations of the
      following:

After
      months of operations, we include acquired sales centers in the base business
      calculation including the comparative prior year period.

The
      increase in net sales is primarily a result of the Horizon acquisitions and
      the
      growth in our base business.

Base
      business sales growth was 10% in 2006 due primarily to the
      following:

·

a
                larger installed base of swimming pools resulting in increased sales
                of
                non-discretionary products;

·

estimated
                price increases of 3% to 4% that we passed through the supply
                chain;

·

the
                continued successful execution of our sales, marketing and service
                programs;

·

26%
                growth in complementary product sales;
                and

·

the
                opening of nine new base business sales center
                locations.

New
      product initiatives continue to be focused on our complementary products
      category, for which sales have grown from $3.0 million in 1999 to $180.1 million
      in 2006. These products, which our customers historically purchased from other
      suppliers, carry gross margins comparable to our traditional product categories.
      We no longer include Horizon’s sales in our complementary product
      calculations.

Gross
      Profit

Base
      business gross profit growth of 12% contributed $48.7 million to the increase
      in
      2006, while acquired sales centers accounted for most of the remaining
      increase.

Gross
      margin increased 40 basis points in 2006 due primarily to the benefits achieved
      through our supply chain management initiatives, including our pre-price
      increase inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of 2005 and second quarter
      of
      2006. We made aggressive early buy purchases during the fourth quarter of 2005
      to take advantage of price discounts and to mitigate the impact of expected
      price increases, and we made additional pre-price increase purchases during
      the
      second quarter of 2006 that benefited our third quarter gross
      margins.

Our
      gross
      margin improvement also includes slightly higher margin contribution from
      acquired businesses and a small favorable product mix shift in 2006 to higher
      margin products, which is attributable to our successful sales initiatives
      including our expansion of parts product and complementary product offerings.
      The overall increase in gross margin was partially offset by lower earned vendor
      incentives as a percentage of total net sales in 2006. This decrease reflects
      a
      lower aggregate vendor incentive rate compared to 2005 and a slight decrease
      between years in our annual purchase volumes as a percentage of total net sales.
      The decrease in rate is due to lower incentives as a percentage of total net
      sales for our acquired businesses and a shift in purchasing mix to products
      with
      lower incentives, primarily complementary products.


Operating
      Expenses

Operating
      expenses grew 25% and as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points
      in
      2006 due primarily to higher expense ratios for our recently acquired businesses
      and start-up costs and higher expense ratios for new sales centers opened in
      2006. We opened 17 sales centers in 2006 compared to only three sales centers
      in
      2005. The 17 new locations include 11 new pool sales centers and six new Horizon
      sales centers. Expenses related to other investments in our business also
      contributed to the increase in operating expenses. We moved 24 existing sales
      centers to bigger locations, expanded another 16 existing sales center
      locations, opened two new construction material distribution centers and also
      launched two new value-added customer programs, among other new company
      initiatives in 2006. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset
      by lower employee bonuses in 2006 of approximately $4.0 million.

Interest
      Expense

Interest
      expense increased $8.8 million between periods as average debt outstanding
      was
      79% higher in 2006 compared to 2005. The higher debt levels in 2006 reflect
      increased borrowings to fund share repurchases, acquisitions and higher working
      capital levels. The weighted average effective interest rate also increased
      to
      5.8% in 2006 from 4.3% in 2005.

Income
      Taxes

Income
      taxes increased to $58.8 million in 2006 from $49.9 million in 2005 due to
      the
      $23.3 million increase in income before income taxes and equity earnings.
      Our effective income tax rate was 38.6% at December 31, 2006 and 38.7%
      at December 31, 2005 as adjusted for the impact of share-based compensation
      expense.

Net
      Income and Earnings Per Share

Net
      income increased 18% to $95.0 million in 2006 from $80.5 million in 2005. Net
      income in 2006 included $1.6 million of net equity earnings from our
      investment in LAC.

Diluted
      earnings per share increased 20% to $1.74 per share in 2006 from $1.45 per
      share
      in 2005.

Fiscal
      Year 2005 compared to Fiscal Year 2004


For
      purposes of comparing operating results for the year ended December 31, 2005
      to
      the year ended December 31, 2004, 201 sales centers were included in the base
      business calculations and 45 sales centers were excluded because they were
      acquired within the last 15 months. The base business calculation also excludes
      our North American manufacturing operations of which we divested in December
      2004. The full impact of share-based compensation expense has been included
      in
      the base business selling and administrative expenses. The following sales
      center acquisitions and manufacturing operation divestitures are excluded from
      the base business calculations for the periods identified:

%

Base
      business growth of 14% contributed to the increase in net sales, primarily
      due
      to the following:

·

a
                larger installed base of swimming pools resulting in increased sales
                of
                non-discretionary products;

·

price
                increases, which were passed through the supply
                chain;

·

the
                continued successful execution of our sales, marketing and service
                programs; and

·

32%
                growth in complementary product
                sales.

We
      continue to focus new product initiatives on our complementary products
      category, for which sales have grown from $3.0 million in 1999 to over $140.0
      million in 2005. In 2005, complementary product sales grew 32% over 2004.

The
      remaining increase in net sales is attributable to acquired sales centers,
      including the Horizon sales centers acquired in October 2005.

Gross
      Profit

Base
      business gross profit growth of 13% contributed $47.9 million to the increase
      in
      2005, while acquired sales centers accounted for the remaining increase.


Gross
      margin decreased to 27.9% in 2005 primarily due to a decrease of approximately
      40 basis points related to the disposition of our North American manufacturing
      assets in December 2004. We also had a slight decrease in gross margin due
      to
      the impact of certain product price increases. Supplier price increases were
      much more pronounced in 2005 than in prior years due to significant price
      increases on certain chemicals used in the pool industry, as well as increases
      in underlying commodity costs, particularly oil and steel. In certain product
      categories, we were only able to pass along price increases on a dollar per
      unit
      basis rather than a percentage basis due to competitive pressures. The overall
      decrease in gross margin was partially offset by improvements achieved through
      our focus on supply chain management and a shift in product mix to our higher
      margin products, most notably in the fourth quarter.

Operating
      Expenses

Operating
      expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 90 basis points in 2005 as
      increases in employee related costs and freight expenses were offset by our
      ability to leverage much of our existing distribution infrastructure and
      personnel base to support our sales growth.

Interest
      Expense

Net
      interest expense increased to $6.4 million in 2005 from $3.9 million 2004 as
      a
      result of an increase in the effective interest rate to 4.3% in 2005 from 2.5%
      in 2004 and a 21% increase in the average debt outstanding. The increase in
      the
      interest rate and higher average debt outstanding was partially offset by a
      $0.3
      million decrease in the amortization of deferred financing fees.

Income
      Taxes

Income
      taxes increased to $49.9 million in 2005 from $40.9 million in 2004 primarily
      due to the $24.6 million increase in income before income taxes and equity
      earnings. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 38.7% at December 31,
      from 39.2% at December 31, 2004 due primarily to the anticipated
      impact of certain tax advantaged business strategies.

Net
      Income and Earnings Per Share

Net
      income increased 27% to $80.5 million in 2005 from $63.4 million in 2004. Net
      income in 2005 included $1.5 million of net equity earnings from our
      investment in LAC.

Diluted
      earnings per share increased 28% to $1.45 per share in 2005 from $1.13 per
      share
      in 2004.


Seasonality
      and Quarterly Fluctuations

Our
      business is highly seasonal. In general, sales and operating income are highest
      during the second and third quarters, which represent the peak months of both
      swimming pool use and installation and landscape installations and maintenance.
      Sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters, when we
      may
      incur net losses. In 2006, approximately 65% of our net sales and 93% of our
      operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the
      year.

We
      typically experience a build-up of product inventories and accounts payable
      during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season.

Excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases, our peak
      borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter, primarily because extended
      payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in April, May
      and
      June, while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in June,
      July and August.

The
      following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for 2006 and 2005.
      We
      have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight
      quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations
      in
      these amounts. In our opinion, this information reflects all normal and
      recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this
      data.
      Due to the seasonal nature of the swimming pool industry, the results of any
      one
      or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire
      fiscal year or of continuing trends.

In
      the
      fourth quarter 2005 and full year 2006, our results of operations include the
      Horizon sales centers that we acquired in October 2005. We expect that our
      quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the
      timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers.
      We
      attempt to open new sales centers at the end of the fourth quarter or the first
      quarter of the subsequent year to take advantage of preseason sales programs
      and
      the following peak selling season.


Weather
      is the principal external factor affecting our business. The table below
      presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather
      conditions.

In
      2006,
      our sales benefited from near record high temperatures across much of North
      America. This favorable impact was more pronounced in the first quarter of
      2006,
      especially in our northern markets which experienced an earlier start to the
      pool season compared to 2005. While maintenance and impulse sales benefited
      from
      the near record high temperatures, sales tied to pool construction and pool
      usage were hindered by above average precipitation in the northeast and
      northwest. Despite 2006 being the hottest year on record nationally, sales
      were
      negatively impacted by much colder than average August and September
      temperatures which shortened the pool season in certain markets.

LIQUIDITY
      AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity
      is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet current
      cash needs. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash
      to
      fund our operating activities, taking into consideration the seasonal nature
      of
      our business. Significant factors which could affect our liquidity include
      the
      following:

·

cash
                flows generated from operating activities;

·

the
                adequacy of available bank lines of
                credit;

·

acquisitions;

·

the
                timing and extent of share
                repurchases;

·

capital
                expenditures;

·

dividend
                payments; and

·

the
                ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory
                terms.


Our
      primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general
      corporate purposes, including acquisitions, share repurchases and dividend
      payments. Our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations
      supplemented by bank borrowings, which combined with seller financing have
      historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance our acquisitions.
      The same principle applies to funds used for share repurchases and capital
      expenditures.

We
      prioritize our use of cash based on investing in our business, returning money
      to our shareholders and maintaining an adequate debt structure. Generally,
      we
      prefer to maintain a one to two times EBITDA leverage ratio. Our specific
      priorities for the use of cash are as follows:

·

maintenance
                and new sales center capital expenditures estimated at 0.5% to 0.75%
                of
                net sales;

·

strategic
                acquisitions executed
                opportunistically;

·

payment
                of cash dividends as and when declared by the Board;

·

repurchase
                of common stock at Board defined parameters;
                and

·

repayment
                of debt.

Sources
      and Uses of Cash

The
      following table summarizes our cash flows (in thousands):

Our
      cash provided by operations increased $29.6 million compared to 2005 due
      primarily to the increase in net income and the impact related to our fourth
      quarter 2005 early buy purchases. In 2005, our cash provided by operations
      was
      negatively impacted by early buy inventory purchases that we received and paid
      for in the fourth quarter of 2005. This impact is reflected in the net change
      in
      our inventory and accounts payable balances between periods, but the benefit
      to
      our 2006 cash provided by operations was largely offset by the decrease in
      accrued expenses which included a $27.0 million payment for estimated
      federal tax payments that were deferred from the second half of 2005 as allowed
      by the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005. The remaining increase in
      cash
      provided by operations is attributable to the change in our accounts receivable
      balance between periods.

Our
      cash used in investing activities included $85.7 million for our acquisition
      of
      Horizon in the fourth quarter of 2005. In 2006, our financing activities
      included $90.6 million of net proceeds from debt and cash related to our stock
      plans, offset by $111.1 million of total share repurchases and $21.1 million
      for
      the payment of our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders, which we increased
      in the second quarter of 2006. The impact of our common stock repurchases
      reduced diluted weighted average shares outstanding by approximately
      1.1 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Future
      Sources and Uses of Cash

Our
      unsecured syndicated senior credit facility (the Credit Facility), which matures
      on December 20, 2010, now provides for $220.0  million in
      borrowing capacity including a $160.0 million five-year revolving credit
      facility (the Revolver) and a $60.0 million term loan (the Term Loan). During
      the third quarter of 2006, we exercised the $40.0 million accordion feature
      under the Revolver, which increased our borrowing capacity from $180.0 million
      to $220.0 million. The Credit Facility includes sublimits for the issuance
      of
      swingline loans and standby letters of credit.

At
      December 31, 2006, there was $131.2 million outstanding and $28.4
      million available for borrowing under the Revolver. The weighted average
      effective interest rate on the Revolver was approximately 6.1% for the year
      ended December 31, 2006.

At
      December 31, 2006, there was $60.0 million outstanding under the Term
      Loan of which $3.0 million is classified as current. In December 2005, we
      entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce our exposure to
      fluctuations in interest rates. Effective on June 30, 2006, the swap agreement
      converts our variable rate Term Loan to a fixed-rate basis until its termination
      on December 31, 2008. We have designated this swap as a cash flow hedge. During
      the year ended December 31, 2006, no gains or losses were recognized on
      this swap. The weighted average effective interest rate of the Term Loan was
      approximately 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006.


In
      March
      2006, we renewed our accounts receivable securitization facility (the
      Receivables Facility), which provides a seasonal borrowing capacity of up to
      $150.0 million, through March 2007. The Receivables Facility provides for the
      true sale of certain of our receivables as they are created to a wholly owned,
      bankruptcy-remote subsidiary. This subsidiary grants an undivided security
      interest in the receivables to an unrelated commercial paper conduit. Because
      of
      the structure of the bankruptcy-remote subsidiary and our ability to control
      its
      activities, we include the transferred receivables and related debt in our
      Consolidated Balance Sheets. We continue to employ this arrangement because
      it
      provides us with a lower cost form of financing. At December 31, 2006,
      there was $74.3 million outstanding under the Receivables Facility at a weighted
      average effective interest rate of 5.6%. We intend to renew the Receivables
      Facility in March 2007 with comparable or similar terms, and we do not have
      any
      reason to believe that we will not be able to do so.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all covenants and financial
      ratio requirements related to our Credit Facility and our Receivables Facility.
      For additional information regarding the Credit Facility, see Note 5 of “Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements,” included in Item 8 of this Form
      10-K.

Our
      Board
      increased the authorization for the repurchase of shares of our common stock
      in
      the open market twice during 2006, including an increase to $100.0 million
      in
      November 2006. Subsequent to year end, we repurchased an additional
      $20.9 million, or 572,200 shares, of our common stock on the open market
      leaving $71.8 million authorized for repurchases as of February 23, 2007. We
      intend to continue to repurchase shares on the open market from time to time,
      depending on market conditions. We may use cash flows from operations to fund
      these purchases, or we may incur additional debt.

On
      February 12, 2007, we issued and sold $100.0 million aggregate principal amount
      of Floating Rate Senior Notes (the Notes) in a private placement offering
      pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement. The Notes are due
      February 12, 2012 and will accrue interest on the unpaid principal
      balance at a floating rate equal to a spread of 0.600% over the three-month
      LIBOR, as adjusted from time to time. We used the net proceeds from the
      placement to pay down borrowings under the Credit Facility. In February 2007,
      we
      also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce our exposure to
      fluctuations in interest rates on the Notes. The swap agreement converts the
      variable interest rate to a fixed rate of 5.088% on the initial notional amount
      of $100.0 million, which will decrease to a notional amount of $50.0
      million in 2010. For additional information regarding the Notes, see Note 13
      of
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” included in Item 8 of this Form
      10-K.

We
      believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations
      and
      anticipated growth, including expansion in existing and targeted market areas.
      We continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with
      acquisition candidates. If suitable acquisition opportunities or working capital
      needs arise that would require additional financing, we believe that our
      financial position and earnings history provide a solid base for obtaining
      additional financing resources at competitive rates and terms. Additionally,
      we
      may issue common or preferred stock to raise funds.


Contractual
      Obligations

At
      December 31, 2006, our contractual obligations for long-term debt,
      short-term financing and operating leases were as follows (in
      thousands):

This
      table does not include estimated future interest expense related to long-term
      debt and short-term financing. For additional discussion related to our debt,
      see Note 5 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” included in Item 8
      of this Form 10-K.

Item
                7A.

Quantitative
                and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
                Risk

We
      are
      exposed to market risks, including interest rate risk and foreign currency
      risk.
      The adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed
      below. The following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced
      level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes.
      Further, in the event of changes of such magnitude, we would likely take actions
      to mitigate our exposure to such changes.

Interest
      Rate Risk

Our
      earnings are exposed to changes in short-term interest rates because of the
      variable interest rates on our debt. If (i) the variable rates on our
      Credit Facility and our Receivables Facility increased or decreased 1.0% from
      the rate at December 31, 2006; and (ii) we borrowed the maximum amount
      available under the Credit Facility ($220.0 million) and the Receivables
      Facility ($150.0 million) for all of 2006, then our pretax income would change
      by approximately $1.9 million and earnings per share would change by $0.03
      per diluted share based on the number of weighed average diluted shares
      outstanding at December 31, 2006.

The
      fair
      value of our Revolver is not affected by changes in market interest rates.
      In
      December 2005, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce our
      exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our Term Loan. The swap was in
      effect as of June 30, 2006 and terminates on December 31, 2008.

Foreign
      Exchange Risk

We
      have
      wholly owned subsidiaries in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, France,
      Portugal, Spain and Italy. In the past, we have not hedged our foreign currency
      exposure, and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our
      operating results. Future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively
      impact our revenues, operating expenses and earnings. Due to the size of our
      foreign operations, however, we do not anticipate that exposure to foreign
      currency rate fluctuations will be material in 2007.

INDEX
      TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Report
      of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
      Board
      of Directors and Shareholders

Pool
      Corporation

We
      have
      audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pool Corporation
      (formerly SCP Pool Corporation) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and
      the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash
      flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These
      financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
      responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
      on
      our audits.

We
      conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
      statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
      on a
      test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
      statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
      and
      significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
      financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
      reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
      our
      opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
      material respects, the consolidated financial position of Pool Corporation
      at
      December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of its operations
      and
      its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
      December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
      accounting principles.

As
      discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
      changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation

.

We
      also
      have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
      control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria
      established in

Internal
      Control-Integrated Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and
      our

Note
      1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting
      Policies

Description
      of Business

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, Pool Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries
      (the

Company

,
      which
      may be referred to as

POOL

,

we,
      us

or

our

),
      maintained 274 sales centers in North America and Europe from which we sell
      swimming pool equipment, parts and supplies and irrigation and landscape
      products to pool builders, retail stores, service companies, landscape
      contractors and golf courses. We distribute products through three networks:
      The
      SCP Distributors (SCP) network, the Superior Pool Products (Superior) network
      and the Horizon Distributors (Horizon) network.

Basis
      of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

We
      prepared the consolidated financial statements following U.S. generally accepted
      accounting principles (GAAP) and the requirements of the Securities and Exchange
      Commission (SEC). The financial statements include all normal and recurring
      adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position
      and operating results.

The
      consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pool Corporation
      and
      our wholly owned subsidiaries. We eliminated all significant intercompany
      accounts and transactions among our wholly owned subsidiaries. We account for
      our investment in Latham Acquisition Corporation (LAC), which was a 42% interest
      when acquired in December 2004 and has been a 38% interest since September
      2005,
      and our 50% investment in Northpark Corporate Center, LLC (NCC) using the equity
      method of accounting. Accordingly, we report our share of income or loss based
      on our ownership interests in these investments.

Use
      of Estimates

In
      order
      to prepare financial statements that conform to GAAP, we make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and
      accompanying notes. Our most significant estimates are those relating to the
      allowance for doubtful accounts, the inventory reserve, vendor incentives,
      income taxes and incentive compensation accruals. We continually review our
      estimates and make adjustments as necessary, but actual results could be
      significantly different from what we expected when we made these
      estimates.

Segment
      Reporting

Financial
      Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      (SFAS) 131,

Disclosures
      about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,

establishes
      standards for the way that public companies report information about operating
      segments in annual financial statements and for related disclosures about
      products and services, geographic areas and major customers. POOL’s management
      evaluates our sales centers based upon their individual performance relative
      to
      predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures.
      Additionally, POOL’s management makes decisions about how to allocate resources
      primarily on a sales center-by-sales center basis. Since all of our sales
      centers have similar operations and share similar economic characteristics,
      we
      aggregate our sales centers into a single reportable segment.


Seasonality
      and Weather

Our
      business is highly seasonal, and weather is the principal external factor
      affecting our business. In general, sales and net income are highest during
      the
      second and third quarters, which represent the peak months of both swimming
      pool
      use and installation and landscape installations and maintenance. Sales are
      substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur
      net
      losses.

Stock
      Split

In
      August
      2004, our Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock split of our common
      stock, which was paid in the form of a stock dividend on September 10, 2004
      to
      the stockholders of record at the close of business on August 23, 2004.
      Accordingly, all 2004 share and per share data and the related capital amounts
      reflect the effects of this split.

Earnings
      Per Share

In
      accordance with SFAS 128,

Earnings
      per Share

,
      we
      calculate basic earnings per share by dividing net income by the weighted
      average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share includes
      the dilutive effects of stock awards.

Financial
      Instruments

The
      carrying values of cash, receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities
      approximate fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments. The
      carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value as it bears interest
      at variable rates. The carrying value of interest rate swap agreements is based
      on quoted market rates at each balance sheet date.

Cash
      Equivalents

We
      consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months
      or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Credit
      Risk and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We
      record
      our trade receivables at the invoiced amount less an allowance for doubtful
      accounts for estimated losses due to customer non-payment. We perform periodic
      credit evaluations of our customers and we typically do not require collateral.
      Consistent with industry practices, we require payment from our customers within
      30 days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended
      payment terms to qualified customers. The following table summarizes the changes
      in our allowance for doubtful accounts for the past three years (in
      thousands):


Product
      Inventories and Reserve for Inventory Obsolescence

Product
      inventories consist primarily of goods purchased from manufacturers for resale
      to our customers. We record inventory at the lower of cost, using the average
      cost method, or market. We establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence
      based on inventory turns by category with particular emphasis on stock keeping
      units with the weakest sales over the previous 12 months. The reserve is
      intended to reflect the net realizable value of inventory that we may not be
      able to sell at a profit.

In
      evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence at the sales
      center level, we consider a combination of factors including:

·

the
                level of inventory in relationship to historical sales by product,
                including inventory usage by class based on product sales at both
                the
                sales center and Company levels;

·

changes
                in customer preferences;

·

seasonal
                fluctuations in inventory levels;

·

geographical
                location; and

·

new
                product offerings.

Our
      reserve for inventory obsolescence may periodically require adjustment as
      changes occur in the above-identified factors.

The
      following table summarizes the changes in our allowance for inventory
      obsolescence for the past three years (in thousands):

Vendor
      Incentives

We
      account for vendor incentives in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force
      Issue 02-16,

Accounting
      by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from
      a
      Vendor.

Many
      of
      our arrangements with our vendors provide for us to receive incentives of
      specified amounts of consideration, payable to us when we achieve any of a
      number of measures. These measures are generally related to the volume level
      of
      purchases from our vendors and may include negotiated pricing arrangements.
      We
      account for such incentives as if they are a reduction of the prices of the
      vendor’s products and therefore as a reduction of inventory until we sell the
      product, at which time such incentives reduce cost of sales in our income
      statement.

Throughout
      the year, we estimate the amount of the incentive earned based on our estimate
      of cumulative purchases for the fiscal year relative to the purchase levels
      that
      mark our progress toward earning the incentives. We accrue vendor incentives
      on
      a monthly basis using these estimates provided that we determine they are
      probable and reasonably estimable. We continually revise these estimates to
      reflect actual incentives earned based on actual purchase levels and trends.
      When we make adjustments to our estimates, we determine whether any portion
      of
      the adjustment impacts the amount of vendor incentives that are deferred in
      inventory. In accordance with EITF 02-16, we recognize changes in our estimates
      for vendor incentives as a cumulative catch-up adjustment to the amounts
      recognized to date in our financial statements.


Property
      and Equipment

Property
      and equipment are stated at cost. We depreciate property and equipment on a
      straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:

(1)

For
      substantial improvements made near the end of a lease term where we are
      reasonably certain the lease will be renewed, we amortize the leasehold
      improvement over the remaining life of the lease including the expected renewal
      period.

The
      table
      below presents depreciation expense for the past three years (in
      thousands):

Acquisitions

In
      accordance SFAS No. 141,

Business
      Combinations

,
      we
      account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and allocate
      the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
      based on their estimated fair values. We revise these estimates as necessary
      if
      any additional information becomes available during a one year allocation period
      from the date of acquisition. These revisions may include working capital
      adjustments based on new or additional facts about the business, final estimates
      of acquired assets and assumed liabilities and changes in the purchase price
      due
      to updated estimates or the resolution of items related to contingent
      consideration. We include the results of operations of acquisitions in our
      Consolidated Financial Statements as of the acquisition date.

Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill
      represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the
      estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets
      acquired, less liabilities assumed. We account for goodwill under the provisions
      of SFAS 142,

Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets

.
      In
      accordance with these rules, we test goodwill and other indefinite lived
      intangible assets for impairment annually or at any other time when impairment
      indicators exist. For our annual goodwill impairment test, we compare our
      estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including
      goodwill. For additional discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets,
      see
      Note 3.

Self
      Insurance

We
      are
      self-insured for employee health benefits, workers’ compensation coverage and
      property and casualty insurance. We have limited our exposure by maintaining
      excess and aggregate liability coverage for each of these items. We establish
      self-insurance reserves based on known claims and estimates of claims incurred
      but not reported that we obtain from third-party service providers. Our
      management reviews these reserves based on consideration of various factors,
      including but not limited to the age of existing claims, estimated settlement
      amounts and other historical claims data.


Advertising
      Costs

We
      expense advertising costs when incurred. The table below presents advertising
      expense for the past three years (in thousands):




$

9,463

$

7,763

$

6,830

Income
      Taxes

We
      record
      deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between financial
      reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates
      and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse.
      Due
      to changing tax laws and state income tax rates, significant judgment is
      required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences
      that are expected to reverse in the future. For additional discussion of income
      taxes, see Note 8.

Share-Based
      Compensation

We
      account for our employee stock options under SFAS 123(R),

Share-Based
      Payment,

which
      requires companies to recognize compensation cost for stock options and other
      stock-based awards based on their estimated fair value as measured on the grant
      date. We have selected a Black-Scholes model for estimating the grant date
      fair
      value of share-based payments under FAS 123(R) and we used the
      modified-retrospective transition method. As such, all prior period financial
      statements have been adjusted to reflect compensation cost for the amounts
      previously reported in our pro-forma footnote disclosures required by SFAS
      123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, as corrected for immaterial
      amounts of compensation cost associated with our employee stock purchase plan.
      For additional discussion of share-based compensation, see Note 7.

Revenue
      Recognition

We
      recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 104,

Revenue
      Recognition in Financial Statements,

and the
      appropriate amendments. SAB 104 requires that four basic criteria must be met
      before we can recognize revenue:

1.

persuasive
      evidence of an arrangement exists;

2.

delivery
      has occurred or services have been rendered;

3.

the
      seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and

4.

collectibility
      is reasonably assured.

We
      record
      revenue when customers take delivery of products. Customers may pick up products
      at any sales center location, or products may be delivered via our trucks or
      third party carriers. Products shipped via third party carriers are considered
      delivered based on the shipping terms, which are generally FOB shipping
      point.

We
      may
      offer volume incentives, which we accrue monthly as an adjustment to net sales.
      We record customer returns, including those associated with early buy programs,
      as an adjustment to net sales. In the past, customer returns have not been
      material.

We
      report
      revenue net of tax amounts that we collect from our customers and remit to
      governmental authorities. These tax amounts may include, but are not limited
      to,
      sales, use, value added and some excise taxes.


Derivatives
      and Hedging Activities

We
      recognize all derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet. The effective
      portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives qualifying as cash flow
      hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is
      recognized in earnings, or until it becomes unlikely that the hedged transaction
      will occur. The ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value is
      immediately recognized in earnings.

In
      December 2005, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce our
      exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. We designated this swap as a cash
      flow hedge. We recognize any  differences paid or received on the interest
      rate swap as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swap.
      The swap was in effect as of June 30, 2006 and terminates on December 31,
      2008.

Shipping
      and Handling Costs

We
      include shipping and handling fees billed to customers in net sales, and we
      record shipping and handling costs associated with inbound freight as cost
      of
      sales. The table below presents shipping and handling costs associated with
      outbound freight, which we include in selling and administrative expenses (in
      thousands):

Reclassifications

We
      have
      corrected the classification of our deferred tax balances in the Consolidated
      Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005. This reclassification did not
      impact total net assets, net income, earnings per share or cash provided by
      operations as previously reported. For additional discussion of deferred income
      taxes, see Note 8.

We
      also
      corrected the classification of share-based compensation expense in the 2004
      Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  The impact of this reclassification
      was a $0.7 million increase in net cash provided by operations and an offsetting
      increase in net cash used in investing activities.  This reclassification
      had no effect on net income or earnings per share as previously
      reported.

Note
      2 - Acquisitions and Divestitures

      Acquisitions

In
      August
      2006, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Wickham Supply, Inc. and
      Water
      Zone, LP (collectively Wickham), a leading regional irrigation products
      distributor. Wickham operates 14 distribution sales centers with 13 locations
      throughout Texas and one location in Georgia. We have included the results
      of
      operations for Wickham in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the
      acquisition date. Our purchase price allocations for Wickham have been completed
      on a preliminary basis, subject to adjustment should new or additional facts
      about the business become known. We expect to finalize the allocations by the
      third quarter of 2006.

      Acquisitions

In
      October 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Automatic Rain Company
      through our newly formed and wholly owned subsidiary Horizon Distributors,
      Inc.
      (Horizon). Horizon is a leading regional wholesale distributor of irrigation
      and
      landscape products serving professional contractors in the landscape
      construction and maintenance markets. We believe t

his
      transaction brings added depth and diversity to our operations through an
      extension of our non-core swimming pool product offerings and furthers our
      objective of being the resource for pool and landscaping contractors. Horizon
      is
      a natural addition to our business, as irrigation and landscaping are often
      key
      components to completing a swimming pool installation or remodel.


The
      purchase price for the issued and outstanding stock of Automatic Rain Company
      was approximately $87.1 million in cash, which includes approximately $1.4
      million in working capital adjustments that were recorded as of December 31,
      2005, and paid subsequent to year end.

The

purchase
      price was determined based on our negotiations with the former shareholders
      of
      Automatic Rain Company and our valuation considerations, which included
      historical and prospective earnings, net asset value and other valuation
      considerations consistent with our historical valuation of
      acquisitions.

We
      accounted for the acquisition as a purchase business combination with the
      purchase price preliminarily allocated to the fair values of the acquired assets
      net of assumed liabilities. In connection with the acquisition, we recorded
      other intangible assets totaling $14.4 million for the estimated fair value
      of a
      tradename, a non-compete agreement and certain employment contracts. We also
      recorded $33.0 million of goodwill in connection with the acquisition, which
      we
      expect to be fully deductible for tax purposes.

During
      the first quarter of 2006, we made a purchase price allocation adjustment that
      lowered the estimated fair value of non-compete provisions within the employment
      contracts of certain members of Horizon’s management team. During the third
      quarter of 2006, we made a $0.7 million purchase price allocation adjustment
      that reduced the allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on better collections,
      the realized value of the accounts receivable was higher than originally
      estimated. With these adjustments, we have finalized the purchase price
      allocations for our acquisition of Automatic Rain Company. Horizon's 
results of operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income
      since the acquisition date.

The
      following table summarizes the final estimated fair values of the assets
      acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition (in
      thousands):

The
      components of intangible assets listed in the table above as of the acquisition
      date are as follows (in thousands):

We
      determined that the Horizon tradename has an indefinite life, and therefore
      it
      is not subject to amortization. We are amortizing the non-compete agreement
      and
      employee contracts using the straight-line method over their estimated useful
      lives.

In
      October 2005, we also acquired B&B s.r.l. (Busatta), a swimming pool supply
      distributor based in the northwestern Italian city of San Bernardo d'Ivrea,
      near
      Turin, as well as the assets of Direct Replacements, Inc., a Marietta, Georgia
      packaged pool distributor. Busatta is our first location in Italy and allows
      us
      to further our presence in the European market. We have included the results
      of
      operations for Busatta and Direct Replacements, Inc. in our Consolidated
      Financial Statements since the respective acquisition dates. We have finalized
      the purchase price allocations for these acquisitions.


      Acquisitions and Divestitures

In
      December 2004, we acquired certain assets of Latham International LP’s Canadian
      subsidiary, Pool Tech Distribution Inc., (Pool Tech or the Pool Tech
      Acquisition). Pool Tech distributes swimming pool supplies and equipment through
      three sales centers in Ontario, Canada. We funded this transaction primarily
      through the exchange of manufacturing assets held by our subsidiary, Les
      Industries R.P. Inc. As a part of this transaction, we also completed the
      divestiture of our manufacturing assets located in Fort Wayne, Indiana to LAC.
      In exchange for these assets and cash consideration, we received a 42% interest
      in LAC. Our decision to divest of our manufacturing facilities in Canada and
      Indiana allows us to focus on our core distribution business while our
      investment in LAC provides us with a strategic relationship with an important
      supplier.

Other
      intangible assets include the estimated fair value of the non-compete agreement
      related to Pool Tech, which we are amortizing on a straight-line basis over
      the
      five year contractual life. We recorded a $0.2 million gain on the
      exchange, the entire amount of which was deferred and recorded as a reduction
      of
      our investment in LAC. We disposed of approximately $12.9 million of
      goodwill in connection with the divestiture of our manufacturing assets in
      Canada and Indiana. In connection with this transaction, LAC acquired the
      business of Latham International, LP, a manufacturer of vinyl swimming pool
      liners, polymer and steel panels, steps and related swimming pool products
      based
      in Albany, New York.

We
      have
      included the results of operations for Pool Tech in our Consolidated Financial
      Statements since the acquisition date. We account for our interest in LAC using
      the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, we report our share of income
      or
      loss based on our ownership interest in LAC.

Note
      3 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In
      October 2006, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test.  As a
      result of this test, we believe the goodwill on our balance sheet is not
      impaired.

The
      changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows (in
      thousands):

Purchase
      price adjustments in 2006 represent final adjustments for the Horizon
      acquisition, the write-off of a $2.1 million deferred tax liability related
      to a
      previous acquisition and final adjustments related to our other 2005
      acquisitions. Purchase price adjustments in 2005 represent payment of contingent
      amounts related to the 2003 Quebec acquisition and certain adjustments related
      to the Pool Tech acquisition.


Other
      intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands):

The
      tradename has an indefinite useful life, and therefore is not subject to
      amortization, but is subject to periodic impairment testing under FAS 142.
      The
      non-compete and distribution agreements have finite useful lives, and as such,
      we amortize these agreements using the straight-line method over their
      respective contractual terms. Other intangible amortization expense was
      $4.6 million and $3.9 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The
      table
      below presents estimated amortization expense for other intangible assets for
      the next five years (in thousands):


Note
      4 - Details of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts

The
      table
      below presents additional information regarding certain balance sheet accounts
      (in thousands):

(1)

The
      balance includes $27.0 million of income taxes payable related to the deferral
      of estimated income tax payments as allowed by the Hurricane Katrina Tax Relief
      Act of 2005.


Note
      5 - Debt

The
      components of our long-term debt for the past two years were as follows (in
      thousands):

As
      amended on December 20, 2005, our unsecured syndicated senior credit facility
      (the Credit Facility), which matures on December 20, 2010, now
      provides for $220.0 million in borrowing capacity including a
      $160.0 million five-year revolving credit facility (the Revolver) and a
      $60.0 million term loan (the Term Loan). During the third quarter of 2006,
      we
      exercised the $40.0 million accordion feature under the Revolver, which
      increased our borrowing capacity from $180.0 million to $220.0 million. The
      Credit Facility includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and
      standby letters of credit.

At
      December 31, 2006, there was $131.2 million outstanding and $28.4
      million available for borrowing under the Revolver. The weighted average
      effective interest rate of the Revolver was approximately 6.1% for the year
      ended December 31, 2006.

Borrowings
      under the Revolver bear interest, at our option, at either of the
      following:

a.

a
                base rate, which is the greater of (i) the Wachovia Bank, National
                Association prime rate or (ii) the overnight Federal Funds Rate plus
                0.50%; or

b.

the
                London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread ranging from
                0.600% to
                1.250%, with such spread in each case depending on our leverage ratio.

Borrowings
      under the Term Loan bear interest, at our option, at either of the
      following:

a.

a
                base rate, which is the greater of (i) the Wachovia Bank, National
                Association prime rate or (ii) the overnight Federal Funds Rate plus
                0.50%; or

b.

the
                London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread ranging from
                0.625% to
                0.750%, with such spread in each case depending on our leverage ratio.

We
      are
      also required to pay (a) an annual facility fee of 0.150% to 0.250%, with such
      spread in each case depending on our leverage ratio, (b) an annual commercial
      letter of credit issuance fee of 0.125% multiplied by the face amount of each
      letter of credit and (c) a letter of credit commission of 0.150% to 0.250%
      multiplied by face amount of each letter of credit, with such spread in each
      case depending on our leverage ratio.

At
      December 31, 2006, there was $60.0 million outstanding on the
      Term Loan. Of the total outstanding balance, $57.0 million is classified as
      long-term and payments totaling $3.0 million are classified as current. Our
      scheduled quarterly principal installments on the Term Loan begin on March
      31,
      2007. Future payments on the Term Loan will be $3.0 million in 2007, $3.0
      million in 2008, $6.0 million in 2009 and $48.0 million in 2010. The
      weighted average effective interest rate of the Term Loan was approximately
      5.5%
      for the year ended December 31, 2006.


In
      December 2005, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce our
      exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Effective on June 30, 2006, the
      swap
      agreement converts our variable rate Term Loan to a fixed-rate basis until
      its
      termination on December 31, 2008. We record any differences paid or received
      on
      the interest rate swap as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of
      the
      swap. We have designated this swap as a cash flow hedge and we record the
      changes in the fair value of the swap to accumulated other comprehensive income.

During
      the year ended December 31, 2006, no gains or losses were recognized on
      this swap and there was no effect on income from hedge ineffectiveness. The
      net
      difference between interest paid and interest received related to the swap
      agreement included in interest expense was $0.2 million. At
      December 31, 2006, the fair value of the swap agreement was a $0.2
      million unrealized gain in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Our
      obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by all of our existing
      and
      future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries.

The
      Credit Facility contains terms and provisions (including representations,
      covenants and conditions) and events of default customary for transactions
      of
      this type. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Credit
      Facility, the lenders may terminate their obligations thereunder and may require
      us to repay all amounts thereunder. Financial covenants include maintenance
      of a
      maximum average total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.
      Other covenants include restrictions on our ability to, among other things,
      pay
      dividends or make other capital distributions (other than in accordance with
      our
      current dividend policy). The Credit Facility limits the declaration and payment
      of dividends on our common stock to no more than 50% of the preceding year’s net
      income, provided that we are not in default or no event of default has occurred
      and the dividends are declared and paid in a manner consistent with our past
      practice.

In
      March
      2006, we renewed our accounts receivable securitization facility (the
      Receivables Facility), which provides a seasonal borrowing capacity of up to
      $150.0 million, through March 2007. The Receivables Facility provides for the
      true sale of certain of our receivables as they are created to a wholly owned,
      bankruptcy-remote subsidiary. This subsidiary grants an undivided security
      interest in the receivables to an unrelated commercial paper conduit. Because
      of
      the structure of the bankruptcy-remote subsidiary and our ability to control
      its
      activities, we include the transferred receivables and related debt in our
      Consolidated Balance Sheets. We employed this arrangement because it provides
      us
      with a lower cost form of financing. The Receivables Facility has numerous
      restrictive covenants, which require that we maintain a minimum average total
      leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum net worth ratio. At
      December 31, 2006 there was $74.3 million outstanding under the
      Receivables Facility at a weighted average effective interest rate of
      5.6%.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all covenants and financial
      ratio requirements related to our Credit Facility and our Receivables Facility.

We
      capitalize financing costs we incur related to implementing and amending our
      debt. These costs are recorded as other assets on our Consolidated Balance
      Sheets and amortized over the contractual life of the related debt. The changes
      in deferred financing costs are as follows (in thousands):

Note
      7 - Share-Based Compensation

We
      adopted SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006 using a Black-Scholes-Merton option
      valuation model and the modified retrospective transition method. Prior to
      January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock option awards under the intrinsic value
      method prescribed by APB 25, as permitted by SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

.
      Accordingly, we did not record compensation expense for options issued with
      an
      exercise price equal to the stock’s market price on the grant date. As of
      January 1, 2006, we have adjusted all prior period financial statements and
      the
      related footnote disclosures to reflect compensation cost for the amounts
      previously reported in our pro-forma footnote disclosures required by SFAS
      123,
      as corrected for immaterial amounts of compensation cost associated with our
      employee stock purchase plan.

Share-Based
      Plans

We
      award
      stock options and restricted stock to our employees and non-employee directors
      under our stock option plans.

Under
      the
      1995 Stock Option Plan (the 1995 Plan) our Board of Directors (the Board) was
      authorized to grant stock options to employees, agents, consultants or
      independent contractors. These options generally were exercisable two years
      after the grant date, and they expire ten years from the grant date. In May
      1998, the Board suspended the 1995 Plan. Options granted prior to the suspension
      were not affected by this action.

In
      May
      1998, our stockholders approved the 1998 Stock Option Plan (the 1998 Plan),
      which authorized the Board to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights,
      restricted stock and performance awards to employees, agents, consultants or
      independent contractors. These options generally were exercisable three or
      more
      years after the grant date, and they expire ten years after the grant date.
      In
      May 2002, the Board suspended the 1998 Plan. Options granted prior to the
      suspension were not affected by this action.


In
      May
      2002, our stockholders approved the 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2002
      Plan), which authorized the Board to grant stock options and restricted stock
      awards to employees, agents, consultants or independent contractors. In
      May 2004, our stockholders approved an amendment to increase the number of
      shares authorized for issuance under the 2002 Plan from 1,575,000 to 2,700,000
      shares. Granted options have an exercise price equal to our stock’s market price
      on the grant date. These options generally vest either five years from the
      grant
      date or on a three/five year split vest schedule, where half of the options
      vest
      three years from the grant date and the remainder vest five years from the
      grant
      date. These options expire ten years from the grant date.

The
      SCP
      Pool Corporation Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan (the Director
      Plan) permits the Board to grant stock options to each non-employee director.
      No
      more than 1,350,000 shares may be issued under this plan. Granted options have
      an exercise price equal to our stock’s market price on the grant date. The
      options generally may be exercised one year after the grant date, and they
      expire ten years after the grant date. The Director plan expired during
      2006.

Stock
      Option Awards

The
      following is a summary of the stock option activity under our stock option
      plans
      for the year ended December 31, 2006:

The
      table
      below summarizes information about stock options outstanding and exercisable
      at
      December 31, 2006:


The
      following table summarizes the cash proceeds and tax benefits realized from
      the
      exercise of stock options:

We
      estimated the fair value of employee stock option awards at the grant date
      based
      on the assumptions summarized in the following table:

We
      calculated expected volatility over the expected term of the awards based on
      our
      historical volatility. In prior years, we used monthly price observations for
      our historical volatility calculation. In 2006, we began using weekly price
      observations for our historical volatility calculation because we believe that
      they provide a more appropriate measurement of volatility given the trading
      patterns of our common stock. We estimated the expected term based on the
      vesting period of the awards and our historical exercise activity for awards
      with similar characteristics. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.
      Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximating the expected
      term of the option. We determined the expected dividend yield based on the
      anticipated dividends over the expected term.

For
      purposes of recognizing share-based compensation expense, we ratably expense
      the
      estimated fair value of employee stock options over the options’ requisite
      service period. Generally, the requisite service period for our share-based
      awards is the vesting period. We recognize compensation cost for awards with
      graded vesting using the graded vesting recognition method.

The
      table
      below presents the total share-based compensation expense for stock option
      awards and the related recognized tax benefits for the past three years (in
      thousands):

In
      2006,
      we modified certain stock option agreements to reflect the proper grant
      dates and exercise prices. There was no material impact related to the
      modification of these stock option agreements. As such, we did not recognize
      any
      additional share-based compensation expense.


Restricted
      Stock Awards

The
      following is a summary of the restricted stock awards activity under our stock
      option plans for the year ended December 31, 2006:

The
      restricted stock awards generally vest five years from the grant date, and
      expire ten years from the grant date. At December 31, 2006, the unamortized
      compensation expense related to the restricted stock awards totaled $0.4
      million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.1 years.
      The total fair value of restricted stock awards vested during the years ended
      December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $0.1 million for each year. No restricted
      stock awards vested during 2004. Total share-based compensation expense
      recognized related to these restricted stock awards was $0.2 million, $0.3
      million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively.

Prior
      to
      the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we recorded restricted stock awards as unearned
      compensation, a reduction of stockholders’ equity, based on the quoted fair
      market value of our common stock on the date of grant. We adjusted the common
      stock balances on the date of grant to reflect the issuance of the restricted
      stock awards. We recorded compensation expense ratably over the vesting period
      with an offsetting credit to the unearned compensation balance. Under the
      provisions of SFAS 123(R), restricted stock awards are not deemed to be issued
      until the end of the vesting period. As such, we reclassified the unearned
      compensation balance to additional paid-in capital upon adoption and we
      recognize compensation cost over the requisite service period with an offsetting
      credit to additional paid-in capital.

Employee
      Stock Purchase Plan

In
      March
      1998, the Board adopted the SCP Pool Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan
      (the ESPP). Under our ESPP, employees who meet minimum age and length of service
      requirements may purchase stock at 85% of the lower of:

a.

the
                closing price of our common stock at the end of a six month plan
                period
                ending either June 30 or December 31;
                or

b.

the
                average of the beginning and ending closing prices of our common
                stock for
                such six month period.

No
      more
      than 956,250 shares of our common stock may be issued under our ESPP. For the
      two plan periods in each year presented below, we awarded the following
      aggregate share amounts:




49,666

49,795

56,622

Share-based
      compensation expense related to our ESPP was $0.4 million in 2006, $0.3 million
      in 2005 and $0.4 million in 2004. The grant date fair value for the most recent
      purchase period ended December 31, 2006 was $5.88 per share.


Impact
      of Adoption of SFAS 123(R)

      impact of the adoption of SFAS 123(R) on our Consolidated Statements of Income
      and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is as follows (in thousands, except

Note
      8 - Income Taxes

Income
      from continuing operations before the provision for income taxes is attributable
      to the following jurisdictions (in thousands):

The
      provision for income taxes consisted of the following (in
      thousands):

We
      made
      payments related to income taxes totaling $74.8 million in 2006 and
      $14.3 million in 2005. We deferred our third and fourth quarter 2005
      estimated federal tax payments as allowed by the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief
      Act of 2005 (the Act). These payments of approximately $27.0 million were paid
      in October 2006.

A
      reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to our effective tax
      rate
      on income before income taxes and equity earnings is as follows:

We
      recorded equity earnings in LAC net of income tax expense of $1.0 million and
      $0.9 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. These amounts are not reflected
      in
      the tables above.


The
      components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in
      thousands):

As
      presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the change in deferred
      income taxes includes, among other items, the change in deferred income taxes
      related to the deferred income tax provision, the change in deferred income
      taxes related to the increase in equity earnings in unconsolidated interests
      and
      the change in deferred income taxes related to the estimated tax impact of
      accumulated other comprehensive income.

We
      reduce
      federal and state income taxes payable by the tax benefits associated with
      the
      exercise of nonqualified stock options. We receive an income tax benefit based
      on the difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value
      of
      the stock at the time the option is exercised. This benefit, which we record
      in
      stockholders’ equity, was $14.6 million in 2006 and $13.5 million in
      2005.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, United States income taxes were not provided on earnings
      of
      our foreign subsidiaries, as we have invested or expect to invest the
      undistributed earnings indefinitely. If in the future these earnings are
      repatriated to the United States, or if we determine that the earnings will
      be
      remitted in the foreseeable future, additional income tax provisions may be
      required.


We
      hold,
      through our affiliates, cash balances in the countries in which we operate,
      including significant amounts held outside the United States. Most of the
      amounts held outside the United States could be repatriated to the United
      States, but, under current law, may be subject to United States federal income
      taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Repatriation of some foreign
      balances is restricted by local laws including the imposition of withholding
      taxes in some jurisdictions. We have not provided for the United States federal
      tax liability on these amounts and for financial statement purposes, these
      foreign cash balances are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United
      States.

In
      June
      2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48,

Accounting
      for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

,

an
      interpretation of SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes

,
      to
      create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions.
      FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum
      recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized
      in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
      measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
      periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years
      beginning after December 15, 2006. We will adopt FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007,
      as required. The cumulative impact of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded in
      retained earnings. We do not expect that the adoption of FIN 48 will have a
      material impact our financial position and results of operations. We anticipate
      that the accounting for FIN 48 may provide for greater volatility in our
      effective income tax rate as items are derecognized or there are changes in
      measurement recorded in interim periods.

Note
      11 - Related Party Transactions

In
      May
      2005, we acquired a 50% membership interest in NCC through a $1.1 million
      cash contribution. NCC owns and operates an office building in Covington,
      Louisiana. We lease corporate and administrative offices from NCC, occupying
      approximately 50,000 square feet of office space. We amended the lease agreement
      in May 2005. The amended agreement has a 10 year term and, as of
      December 31, 2006, we pay rent of $56,600 per month.

In
      October 1999, we entered into a lease agreement with S&C Development, LLC
      for a sales center facility in Mandeville, Louisiana. The sole member of S&C
      Development, LLC is A. David Cook, a POOL executive officer. The original seven
      year lease term commenced on January 1, 2000 and was set to expire on
      December 31, 2006. We renewed this lease for an additional seven year lease
      term, at a monthly rent of $7,031. The lease will expire on December 31,
      2013.

In
      January 2002, we entered into a lease agreement with S&C Development, LLC
      for additional warehouse space adjacent to our Mandeville sales center. The
      original five year lease term commenced on February 4, 2002, and was
      set to expire on December 31, 2006. We renewed this lease for an additional
      seven year lease term at a monthly rent of $4,840. The total $11,871 monthly
      lease payment is for both facilities consisting of 21,100 square feet. The
      lease
      will expire on December 31, 2013.

In
      January 2001, we entered into a lease agreement with S&C Development, LLC
      for a sales center facility in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The ten year lease
      term
      commenced on November 10, 2001, and, as of
      December 31, 2006, we pay rent of $12,745 per month for the 25,000
      square foot facility.

In
      March
      1997, we entered into a lease agreement with Kenneth St. Romain for a sales
      center facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Kenneth St. Romain is a POOL general
      manager.

In
      January 2002, we extended this lease for a second term of five years
      which commenced on March 1, 2002. As of December 31, 2006,
      we pay rent of $10,340 per month for the 23,500 square foot facility.

In
      May
      2001, we entered into a lease agreement with Kenneth St. Romain for a sales

Note
      12 - Employee Benefit Plans

We
      offer
      a 401(k) savings and retirement plan, which provides benefits for substantially
      all employees who meet minimum age and length of service requirements. Eligible
      employees are able to contribute up to 25% of their compensation, subject to
      the
      federal dollar limit. For plan participants, we contribute 50% of employee
      contributions up to 8% of their compensation. Effective January 1, 2005, we
      eliminated our profit-sharing plan and increased the discretionary company
      matching contribution for the 401(k) plan to 8% as discussed above.

Effective
      March 1, 2005, we adopted the Pool Corp Deferred Compensation Plan, a
      nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The plan allows certain employees
      who
      occupy key management positions to defer salary and bonus amounts, and provides
      a matching contribution similar to that provided under our 401(k) plan to the
      extent that a participant’s contributions to the 401(k) plan are limited by IRS
      non-discrimination limitations. The total company matching contribution provided
      to a participant under the 401(k) plan and the Pool Corp Deferred Compensation
      Plan combined for any one year may not exceed 4% of a participant’s salary and
      bonus.

The
      employee and company sponsored contributions are invested in certain equity
      and
      fixed income securities based on individual employee elections.

Note
      14 - Subsequent Event

On
      February 12, 2007, we issued and sold $100.0 million aggregate
      principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes (the Notes) in a private
      placement offering pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement. The Notes are due
      February 12, 2012 and will accrue interest on the unpaid principal
      balance at a floating rate equal to a spread of 0.600% over the three-month
      LIBOR, as adjusted from time to time. The Notes have scheduled quarterly
      payments that are due on February 12, May 12, August 12 and
      November 12 of each year. The Notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by
      each domestic subsidiary that is or becomes a borrower or guarantor under our
      Credit Facility. We used the net proceeds from the placement to pay down
      borrowings under the Credit Facility.

The
      Notes
      are subject to redemption at our option, in whole or in part, at 103% of the
      principal amount on or prior to February 12, 2008 and at 100% of the principal
      amount thereafter, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption and any
      LIBOR
      breakage amount. In the event we have a change of control, the holders of the
      Notes will have the right to put the Notes back to us at par.

The
      Note
      Purchase Agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants for
      transactions of this type, including a maximum Funded Indebtedness to EBITDA
      covenant, a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage covenant and limitations on priority
      debt, liens, subsidiary debt, asset sales and mergers and consolidations. The
      Agreement also contains customary events of default, which if they were to
      occur
      would give the holders of the Notes the right to accelerate the
      Notes.

In
      February 2007, we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce
      our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on the Notes. The swap agreement
      converts the variable interest rate to a fixed rate of 5.088%on the initial
      notional amount of $100.0 million, which will decrease to a notional amount
      of
      $50.0 million in 2010. The swap agreement will terminate on
      February 12, 2012. Including the 0.600% spread, we expect to pay an
      effective interest rate on the Notes of approximately 5.688%.

Controls
      and Procedures

The
      term
“disclosure controls and procedures” is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
      of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Act). The rules refer to the
      controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required
      to be
      disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Act is recorded,
      processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified. In the
      fourth quarter of 2006, we enhanced our disclosure controls and procedures
      to
      address the Security and Exchange Commission’s new Executive Compensation
      disclosure requirements for Definitive Proxy Statements on Schedule 14A. As
      of
      December 31, 2006, management, including the CEO and CFO, performed an
      evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures.
      Based
      on that evaluation, management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that as
      of
      December 31, 2006, our disclosure controls and procedures were
      effective.

We
      maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting that is designed
      to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
      and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
      with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Based on the most recent
      evaluation, we have concluded that no change in our internal control over
      financial reporting occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially
      affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
      over financial reporting.


Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

POOL’s
      management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
      control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
      under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Our internal
      control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to POOL’s management
      and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial
      reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published
      financial statements.  All internal control systems, no matter how well
      designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
      to
      be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
      statement preparation and presentation. Any evaluation or projection of
      effectiveness to future periods is also subject to risk that controls may become
      inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
      the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

POOL’s
      management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
      reporting as of December 31, 2006.  In making this assessment,
      management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
      Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
      Control-Integrated Framework.

Based
      on
      this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2006,
      POOL’s internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide
      reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
      preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
      U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

The
      registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial
      statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K has issued an attestation
      report on management’s assessment of POOL’s internal controls over financial
      reporting. This report appears below.


Report
      of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
      Board
      of Directors and Shareholders

Pool
      Corporation

We
      have
      audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Pool Corporation
      (formerly SCP Pool Corporation) maintained effective internal control over
      financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established
      in

Internal
      Control-Integrated Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the
      COSO criteria). Pool Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
      effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
      of
      the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
      responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
      opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial
      reporting based on our audit.

We
      conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
      internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
      respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
      over
      financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
      the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
      such
      other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
      that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
      company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
      and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
      to
      the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
      permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
      being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
      of
      the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
      detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
      assets that could have a material effect on the financial
      statements.

Because
      of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not
      prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
      inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
      with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
      our
      opinion, management’s assessment that Pool Corporation maintained effective
      internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly
      stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our
      opinion, Pool Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective
      internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based
      on

the
      COSO
      criteria

.

We
      also
      have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Pool
      Corporation as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
      statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
      years in the period ended December 31, 2006, and our report dated
      February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion
      thereon.
