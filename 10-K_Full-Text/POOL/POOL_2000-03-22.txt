PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

SCP Pool Corporation (together with its wholly owned
subsidiaries, the “Company”) distributes swimming pool supplies and
related products to swimming pool remodelers and builders, independent retail
stores and swimming pool repair and service companies. These products include
both non-discretionary pool maintenance products, such as chemicals and
replacement parts, packaged pools (kits to build swimming pools which include
walls, liners, bracing and other materials), and pool equipment, such as
cleaners, filters, heaters, pumps and lights. As of February 29, 2000, the
Company conducted operations through 103 service center locations in 34 states,
the United Kingdom and France.

The Company and its wholly owned operating subsidiary, South
Central Pool Supply, Inc. ("SCP"), are successors to a business founded in 1980
by the Company's former President and Chief Executive Officer, Frank J. St.
Romain. In December 1993, SCP acquired substantially all of the assets and
business of Lake Villa Corporation (formerly known as South Central Pool
Supply, Inc.), a Louisiana Corporation (the "Predecessor") in a leveraged
buyout.

The Company’s net sales have grown from approximately
$161.1 million in 1995 to $569.8 million in 1999. The Company’s domestic
net sales for each of the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 have been $335.0 million,
$455.2 million and $559.3 million, respectively, while the foreign net sales for
each of the years 1998 and 1999 have been $2.4 million and $10.5 million,
respectively. The Company’s net income has grown from $1.6 million in 1995
to $21.1 million in 1999. Total assets of the Company have grown from
approximately $75.4 million in 1995 to $194.1 million in 1999. The Company
expects to continue its growth strategy by opening service centers in new
locations, increasing sales at existing service centers and making strategic
acquisitions.

Recent Acquisitions

The Company completed four acquisitions during 1999 (the
“1999 Acquisitions”). In January 1999, the Company acquired certain
assets of Benson Pump Company (the “Benson Acquisition”) and the
capital stock of Pratts Plastics Limited (the “SPW Acquisition”). The
Company also acquired certain assets of Garden Leisure Products (the “GLP
Acquisition”) and the capital stock of Jean Albouy, S.A. (the “Albouy
Acquisition”) in November and December 1999, respectively. The 1999
Acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the
aggregate purchase price for the 1999 Acquisitions was $25.5 million. Benson
Pump Company operated 20 service centers in 16 states. The Company consolidated
the operations of 15 of these service centers into existing service center
locations and closed one service center location. Pratts Plastic Limited
operated one service center in Essex, England, while Garden Leisure Products
operated one service center in Horsham, England. The Company now operates three
service centers in the United Kingdom. Jean Albouy, S.A. operated one service
center in Rodez, France. The Rodez service center is the Company’s first
service center in France.

The Company intends to pursue additional strategic acquisitions
to further penetrate existing markets and to expand into new geographic markets.
The Company continues to explore appropriate acquisition candidates and is
frequently engaged in discussions regarding potential acquisitions.

In connection with the acquisition from The B-L Network, Inc., the
Company sold the chemical manufacturing and repackaging assets of Alliance
Packaging, Inc., a subsidiary of SCP, to Bio-Lab, Inc., the parent of The B-L
Network, Inc. In addition, the Company and Bio-Lab, Inc. entered into two five-year
supply agreements pursuant to which Bio-Lab, Inc. agreed to supply the Company with
certain chemical products previously supplied to it by Alliance Packaging, Inc.
and with certain chemical products previously supplied to The B-L Network, Inc.
by Bio-Lab, Inc.

The purchase price for Bicknell Huston Distributors, Inc. (the
“BHD Acquisition”) was financed through the offering to the public of
2,025,000 shares of the Company’s common stock in December 1997. In
connection with the BHD Acquisition, the Company entered into a long-term supply
agreement with Pacific Industries, Inc., a subsidiary of Cookson Group plc and
the sole stockholder of BHD (“Pacific”). Under the terms of the
Pacific Supply Agreement, Pacific will supply the Company with polymer panels,
braces, steps, liners and other products used in the construction of in-ground
vinyl pools. The Pacific Supply Agreement has a term of eight years and is
subject to renewal options.

Customers and Marketing

The Company sells its products to approximately 26,000
customers, primarily swimming pool remodelers and builders, retail swimming pool
stores and swimming pool repair and service companies. No customer accounted for
more than 1% of the Company’s sales during 1999.

The Company employs a dedicated sales force that prides itself
on customer relationships. The Company’s principal marketing activities are
conducted by a sales force of 73 salespersons and by its service center
managers. Information regarding the Company’s product line and service
center locations may be found on the internet at

www.scppool.com

.

Purchasing and Suppliers

The Company has good relationships with its suppliers who
generally offer competitive pricing, return policies and promotional allowances.
It is customary in the swimming pool supply industry for manufacturers to offer
extended dating terms on their products to qualifying purchasers such as the
Company. These terms are typically available to the Company for pre-season or
early season purchases. During 1999, the Company focused on improving pricing
and purchasing practices. A preferred vendor program was promoted whereby
service centers were encouraged to purchase products from a smaller number of
vendors in order to effect more efficient purchasing. The service centers were
also encouraged to ensure accurate pricing and greater pricing discipline at the
point of sale. These practices have resulted in better margins throughout the
Company.


Purchasing and Suppliers (continued)

The Company regularly evaluates supplier relationships and considers alternate sourcing to assure competitive
costs and quality standards.  The Company's largest suppliers are Pac-Fab, Inc. (a subsidiary of Pentair
Corporation), Hayward Pool Products, Inc. and Bio-Lab, Inc. (a subsidiary of Great Lakes Chemicals, Inc.); these
suppliers provided approximately 15%, 14% and 8%, respectively, of the Company's material purchases in 1999.

Competition

The Company faces intense competition from many regional and
local distributors in its markets, including several companies that distribute
swimming pool supplies on a national basis, a few companies that distribute
swimming pool supplies on a regional basis and, to a lesser extent, mass-market
retailers and large pool supply retailers. Barriers to entry in the swimming
pool supply industry are relatively low.

The Company competes with other distributors for rights to
distribute brand-name products. The loss or inability to obtain such rights
could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Management believes that
the competition for such distribution rights may result in a competitive
advantage to larger distributors, such as the Company, and a disadvantage to
smaller distributors.

The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in
pool supply distribution are the breadth and availability of products offered,
the quality and level of customer service, competitive product pricing, and
consistency and stability of business relationships with its customers. The
Company believes it generally competes favorably with respect to each of these
factors. Some geographic markets serviced by the Company, particularly higher
density U.S. Sunbelt markets, tend to be more competitive than others.

Seasonality and Weather

The Company’s business is highly seasonal. The principal
external factor affecting the Company’s business is weather. In 1999,
approximately 68% of the Company’s net sales were generated in the second
and third quarters of the year, which represent the peak months of swimming pool
use, installation, remodeling and repair, and approximately 106% of the
Company’s operating income was generated in the same period. See Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations—Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations”.

Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations

The Company’s business is subject to regulation under local
fire codes and federal, state and local environmental and health and safety
requirements including the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act,
the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act and the Occupational Safety and
Health Act. Most of these requirements govern the packaging, labeling, handling,
transportation, storage and sale of pool chemicals by the Company. The Company
stores chemicals at each of its service centers. Certain chemicals stored by the
Company are combustible oxidizing compounds, and the storage of such chemicals
is strictly regulated by local fire codes. In addition, the algicides sold by
the Company are regulated as pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide
and Rodenticide Act and state pesticide laws which primarily relate to labeling
and annual registration. While considerable resources are expended to operate in
substantial compliance with environmental, health and safety requirements, there
can be no assurance that the Company will not be determined to be out of
compliance with, or liable under, such requirements. Such an instance of
noncompliance or liability could have a material adverse effect on the Company
and its operating results.

Employees

As of February 29, 2000, the Company employed approximately
1,100 persons on a full-time basis. During 1999 the Company added 145 employees
in connection with the 1999 Acquisitions.


Intellectual Property

The Company maintains both domestic and foreign registered
trademarks primarily for its private label products and intends to maintain the
trademark registrations important to its business operations. The Company
currently holds a patent on a chemical feeding apparatus and intends to renew
the patent as long as the Company deems necessary. The Company also owns rights
to several internet domain names.

Item 2.

Properties

As of February 29, 2000, the Company conducted operations
through 103 service center locations located in 34 states, the United Kingdom
and France. Service centers are located near customer concentrations, typically
in industrial, commercial or mixed-use zones.

The Company’s service centers range in size from
approximately 6,000 square feet to 51,000 square feet and consist of warehouse,
counter, display, and office space. Prior to June 1999, the Company owned only
one property  located in Phoenix, Arizona. In June 1999, the Company
sold a facility in Phoenix, Arizona that it acquired in connection with a
previous acquisition. All of the Company’s properties are leased for terms
that expire between 2000 and 2007, and many of these leases may be extended. In
certain instances, the Company’s service centers are leased from the former
owners of businesses acquired by the Company.

The Company’s executive offices are located in
approximately 26,000 square feet of leased space in Covington, Louisiana.

The Company believes that no single lease is material to its
operations and that alternate sites are presently available at market rates. See
Item 13, “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions” and Note 6
to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation and
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business. There are no pending
material legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or to which the
property of the Company is subject.

Item 5.

Market for the Registrant’s Common
Stock and Related Security Holder Matters

The common stock of the Company began trading on the Nasdaq
National Market under the symbol “POOL” in October 1995. At February
29, 2000, there were 53 holders of record of common stock.

The following table sets forth in dollars, for the periods
indicated, the range of high and low bid prices for the common stock as reported
by the Nasdaq National Market and adjusted to reflect a three-for-two stock
split in July 1998.

The bid information set forth above reflects inter-dealer prices
without retail mark-ups, markdowns or commissions and may not necessarily
represent actual transactions.

The Company currently intends to retain its earnings for use in
its business and therefore does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the
near future. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of
December 31, 1997, by and among the Company’s operating subsidiary, SCP,
the institutions from time to time party thereto as lenders, LaSalle National
Bank as Agent and Co-Arranger and Hibernia National Bank as Co-Arranger (the
“Senior Loan Facility”) restricts the Company’s ability to pay
dividends. The Senior Loan Facility consists of the Senior Revolving Note and
the Senior Term Note. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be
made by the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) in light
of the Company’s earnings, financial position, capital requirements, credit
agreements and such other factors as the Board deems relevant at such time. See
Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Note 3
to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.


Item 6.

Selected Financial Data

The following table sets forth selected financial data of the
Company. This information should be read in conjunction with Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” and with the Consolidated Financial Statements of
the Company and the Predecessor and related Notes thereto included herein.

(1)

In
1995, the Company recognized an extraordinary loss, net of tax, of $750,000, or
$0.17 per share on a diluted basis, in connection with the write-off of loan
financing fees and a prepayment premium associated with the application of the
proceeds of the Company's initial public offering to reduce indebtedness.

(2)

In
1999, the Company adopted Statement of Position 98-5, “Reporting on the Costs
of Start-Up Activities” and recognized a cumulative effect adjustment, net of a
tax loss, of $500,000, or a net loss of $0.05 per share.


Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The Company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of
swimming pool equipment, parts and supplies, including chemicals, cleaners,
packaged pools and liners, filters, heaters, pumps, lights, repair parts and
other equipment required to build, maintain, install and overhaul residential
and small commercial swimming pools. The Company sells its products primarily
to swimming pool remodelers and builders, independent swimming pool retailers
and swimming pool repair and service companies. These customers tend to be
small, family owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources. The
Company maintains a strict credit policy. Losses from customer receivables have
historically been within management’s expectations.

The swimming pool supply industry is affected by various factors
including general economic conditions, consumer saving and discretionary
spending levels, the level of new housing construction, weather and consumer
attitudes toward pool products for environmental or safety reasons. Although
management believes that the Company’s geographic diversity could mitigate
the effect of a regional economic downturn and that the continuing maintenance
and repair needs for existing swimming pools could mitigate the effect of a
general economic downturn, there can be no assurance that the Company’s
results of operations and expansion plans would not be materially adversely
affected by any of such downturns.

The principal components of the Company’s expenses include
the cost of products purchased from manufacturers and operating expenses which
are primarily related to labor, occupancy, marketing and selling and
administrative expenses. In response to competitive pressures from any of its
current or future competitors, the Company may be required to lower selling
prices in order to maintain or increase market share, and such measures could
adversely affect the Company’s gross margins and operating results.

Results of Operations

The following table shows, for the periods indicated,
information derived from the Consolidated Statements of Income of the Company
expressed as a percentage of net sales for such year.

The following discussion compares the results of operations for
the year ended December 31, 1999 to the year ended December 31, 1998 and the
results of operations for the year ended December 31, 1998 to the year ended
December 31, 1997.

Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 1998

Net sales increased $112.2 million, or 24.5%, to $569.8 million
in 1999 from $457.6 million in 1998. An increase of 14.1% in sales at service
centers open at least 15 months contributed $52.7 million to the increase,
service centers acquired in the Benson Acquisition in 1999 contributed $21.1
million to the increase; and service centers acquired from the SPW Acquisition,
the GLP Acquisition and the Albouy Acquisition (“the European
Acquisitions”) contributed $8.1 million to the increase. The balance of the
increase was attributable to sales at consolidated and new service centers open
less than 15 months.


Results of Operations (continued)

Gross profit increased $30.8 million, or 30.0%, to $133.3
million in 1999 from $102.5 million in 1998. An increase in same store gross
profits of 17.4% accounted for $14.6 million of the increase, while consolidated
and new service centers open less than 15 months accounted for $9.1 million of
the increase. The Benson Acquisition and the European Acquisitions accounted for
the remaining increase. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 1.0%
to 23.4% in the 1999 period from 22.4% in the 1998 period. The increase in gross
profit was realized in the majority of markets across the United States in 1999
and is attributable to an increased focus on pricing and purchasing disciplines.

Selling and administrative expenses increased $16.8 million, or
21.8%, to $94.0 million in 1999 from $77.2 million in the comparable 1998
period. Consolidated and new service centers open less than 15 months accounted
for $8.5 million of the increase, and service centers open at least 15 months
accounted for $3.5 million of the increase. This increase also reflects an
additional $3.6 million and $1.2 million of operating expenses incurred at
service centers acquired in the Benson Acquisition and the European
Acquisitions, respectively. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales
decreased 0.4% compared to 1998.

Interest and other expenses increased $1.2 million, or 33.3%, to
$4.8 million in 1999 from $3.6 million in the comparable 1998 period. The
increase is primarily attributable to an increase in amortization expense of
$0.7 million. This increase is offset by a decrease in interest expense
resulting from lower average outstanding debt levels between periods.
Additionally, miscellaneous expense increased $1.0 million from the comparable
1998 period primarily due to the write-off of certain computer equipment
replaced in connection with improvements to the Company’s information
system and Year 2000 efforts.

Income taxes increased $4.9 million to $12.9 million for 1999
compared to $8.0 million for 1998 primarily due to the $12.7 million increase in
income before income taxes and change in accounting principle. The
Company’s effective tax rate remained constant at 37.0% in 1999.

Year Ended December 31, 1998 Compared to Year Ended
December 31, 1997

Net sales increased $122.6 million, or 36.6%, to $457.6 million
in the year ended December 31, 1998 from $335.0 million in the comparable 1997
period. Service centers acquired in 1998 contributed $69.2 million to the
increase, sales at newly opened centers accounted for $9.1 million of the total
increase, and an increase of approximately 13.6% in sales at service centers
open at least 15 months contributed $44.3 million.

Gross profit increased $29.1 million, or 39.6%, to $102.5
million in the year ended December 31, 1998 from $73.4 million in the comparable
1997 period. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved to 22.4% in the
1998 period from 21.9% in the 1997 period due primarily to higher margins at
service centers acquired in the 1998 BHD Acquisition and also due to improved
margins in California, Florida and the central United States compared to the
same period in the previous year.

Operating expenses increased $19.4 million, or 33.6%, to $77.1
million in the year ended December 31, 1998 from $57.7 million in the comparable
1997 period. This increase is reflective of salaries, occupancy expenses and
other costs associated with new service centers, and, to a lesser extent,
payroll and other operating costs required to support the increased sales volume
at existing service centers. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales
decreased to 16.8% in the 1998 period compared to 17.2% in the 1997 period
primarily as a result of greater internal operating efficiencies.

Interest and other expenses decreased to $3.6 million in the
year ended December 31, 1998 from $4.3 million in the comparable 1997 period.
The decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest expense resulting from
lower average outstanding debt levels between periods and a more favorable
interest rate on the Senior Loan Facility.

Income taxes increased $3.7 million to $8.0 million for 1998
compared to $4.3 million for 1997 primarily due to the $10.4 million increase in
income before income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate decreased to
37.0% for 1998 from 38.0% for 1997 as a result of decreases in the
Company’s blended state income tax rate.


Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations

The Company’s business is highly seasonal. In general,
sales and net income are highest during the second and third quarters, which
represent the peak months of swimming pool use and installation. Sales are
substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when the Company may
incur net losses.

The Company experiences a build-up of inventory and accounts
payable during the first and second quarters of the year in anticipation of the
peak swimming pool supply selling season. The Company’s peak borrowing
occurs during the second quarter primarily because dated accounts payable
offered by the Company’s suppliers typically are payable in April, May and
June, while the Company’s peak accounts receivable collections typically
occur in June, July and August.

To encourage preseason orders, the Company, like many other
swimming pool supply distributors, utilizes preseason sales programs that
provide for extended dating terms and other incentives to its customers. Some of
the Company’s suppliers also offer extended dating terms on certain
products to the Company for preseason or early season purchases. In offering
extended dating terms to its customers and accepting extended dating terms from
its suppliers, the Company effectively finances a portion of its receivables
with extended payables.

The Company expects that its quarterly results of operations
will fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new
service centers and acquisitions. The Company attempts to open its new service
centers at the end of the fourth quarter or the beginning of the first quarter
to take advantage of preseason sales programs and the peak season.

The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly data
for 1999 and 1998, which, in the opinion of management, reflects all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair
presentation of such data. Results of any one or more quarters are not
necessarily indicative of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing
trends.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Currently, the Company’s primary sources of working capital
are cash flow from operations and borrowings under a Senior Loan Facility
consisting of a term loan and a revolving line of credit. The revolving line of
credit has a total borrowing capacity of $65.0 million. The Company’s
borrowings under its credit facility, together with cash flow from operations
and seller financing, historically have been sufficient to support the
Company’s growth and to finance acquisitions. Considering the
Company’s borrowing base as of December 31, 1999, the Company had $39.2
million available for borrowing under its Senior Loan Facility, the only
additional credit source currently available to the Company.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 1999, the Company
made net payments on its revolver loan of $0.9 million and made scheduled
principal payments of $5.0 million required under its Senior Loan Facility.


Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)

Borrowings under the Senior Loan Facility may, at the
Company’s option, bear interest at either (i) the agent’s corporate
base rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, whichever is higher, plus a
margin ranging from 0.0% to 0.5% or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.75%
to 2.0%, in each case depending on the Company’s leverage ratio.
Substantially all of the assets of the Company, including the capital stock of
SCP, secure the Company’s obligations under the Senior Loan Facility. The
Senior Loan Facility has numerous restrictive covenants which require the
Company to maintain minimum levels of interest coverage and fixed charge
coverage and which also restrict the Company’s ability to pay dividends and
make capital expenditures.

As of December 31, 1999, the Company was in compliance with all
such covenants and financial ratio requirements. The Senior Loan Facility
matures on December 31, 2002. Between February 24, 1999 and March 19, 1999 and
between August 20, 1999 and September 20, 1999, the Company purchased 198,200
and 161,200 shares, respectively, of its common stock pursuant to a share
repurchase program announced in October 1998 (see “Share Repurchase
Program”). Certain intercompany dividends paid prior to March 19, 1999 by
the Company created covenant defaults under the Senior Loan Facility. The
lenders under the Senior Loan Facility have waived such defaults in accordance
with the provisions of the Senior Loan Facility.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $17.9
million to $37.3 million in 1999 from $19.4 million in 1998. An increase in net
income provided $7.3 million of the increase while a decrease in use of cash for
operating assets, liabilities and activities provided the remaining $10.6
million. The decrease in use of cash is primarily due to improved management of
working capital.

With the exception of the BHD Acquisition in 1998, which was
financed through the issuance of common stock to the public, the Company’s
acquisitions have been financed primarily by borrowings under its credit
facilities and by seller financing. To finance future acquisitions, the Company
may utilize its ability to borrow additional funds under the Senior Loan
Facility or, depending on market conditions, incur additional indebtedness or
issue common or preferred stock (which may be issued to third parties or to
sellers of acquired businesses).

Share Repurchase Program

In October 1998, the Company announced that it may purchase in
the open market or directly from stockholders up to $10.0 million of common
stock of the Company over a twelve-month period at prices deemed appropriate by
the Company. As of February 29, 2000, the Company had purchased a total of
513,400 shares of its common stock at an average price of $19.47 per share. In
addition, in November 1999, the Company announced that its Board authorized an
additional $20.0 million for the purchase of the Company’s common stock
over the following year. As of February 29, 2000, the Company had not purchased
any shares with the additional $20.0 million authorized.

Intangible Assets

At December 31, 1999, the Company had net intangible assets
which represented 27.4% of total assets and 54.5% of stockholders’ equity.
These net intangible assets consist primarily of $23.2 million net of
accumulated amortization, or 46.7% of the Company’s goodwill balance, which
arose at the time the Company was established on December 29, 1993 in a
leveraged buyout transaction. The remainder has arisen in connection with the
Company’s subsequent acquisitions since its formation in 1993.


Intangible Assets (continued)

Goodwill is amortized over periods ranging from 20 to 40 years.
In assigning such amortization periods, the Company considered the following
factors: (i) projected future cash flows of the acquired business; (ii) effects
of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors that may reduce
a useful life; and (iii) the expected actions of competitors and others that may
restrict present competitive advantages. Management periodically assesses the
recoverability of goodwill and considers whether the goodwill should be
completely or partially written off or the amortization period accelerated. See
Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete
discussion of the policy for evaluating goodwill for impairment. At December 31,
1999, management determined that there is no persuasive evidence that any
material portion of goodwill will dissipate over a shorter period than the
amortization period used.

Year 2000 Issue

As a result of the Company’s Year 2000 planning and
remediation efforts, the Company experienced no significant disruptions in
mission critical information technology and non-information technology systems.

The Company incurred costs totaling $700,000 during the second
quarter of 1999 to upgrade its main system server. The Company believes this
cost was not primarily related to Year 2000 issues. During the third quarter of
1999, the Company incurred approximately $75,000 in consulting fees for Year
2000 contingency planning. The costs to address Year 2000 issues were funded
from cash generated from operations and from the borrowing capacity under the
Senior Loan Facility.

The Company is not aware of any other material problems
resulting from Year 2000 issues, either with its products, its internal systems
or the products and services of third parties. The Company will continue to
monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers
and vendors to ensure that any latent Year 2000 matters that may arise are
addressed promptly.

Item 7a.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk

The Company is exposed to market risks, including interest rate
risk and foreign currency risk. The adverse effects of potential changes in
these market risks are discussed below. The following discussion does not
consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that
could exist following such changes. Further, in the event of changes of such
magnitude, management would likely take actions to mitigate its exposure to such
changes. The Company has not used derivative instruments to engage in
speculative transactions or hedging activities.

Interest Rate Risk

As a result of the variable interest rates on the Senior
Revolving Note and Senior Term Note under the Senior Loan Facility, the
Company’s earnings are exposed to changes in short-term interest rates. If
(i) the variable rates on the Company’s Senior Loan Facility were to
increase by 1.0% from the rate at December 31, 1999; (ii) the Company borrowed
the maximum amount available under its revolving line of credit ($65.0 million)
for all of 2000; and (iii) the Company made all required payments of principal
($5.0 million) in 2000, solely as a result of the increase in interest rates,
the Company’s interest expense would increase by $441,000, resulting in a
$278,000 decrease in net income, assuming an effective tax rate of 37.0%. The
fair value of the Company’s Senior Revolving Note and Senior Term Note is
not affected by changes in market interest rates.

Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company has subsidiaries located in the United Kingdom and
France for which the functional currency is the British Pound and the French
Franc, respectively. Historically, the Company has not hedged its foreign
currency exposure, and fluctuations in British Pound/U.S. Dollar and French Franc/U.S. Dollar exchange rates
have not had a material effect on the Company. Future changes in the exchange
rate of the U.S. Dollar to the British Pound and French Franc may positively or
negatively impact the Company’s revenues, operating expenses and earnings.
However, due to the size of its operations in the United Kingdom and France, the
Company does not anticipate its exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
to be material in 2000.


Cautionary Statement for Purposes of the "Safe
Harbor" Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation

Reform Act of 1995

With the exception of historical matters, the matters discussed
in the Company’s Annual Report and on Form 10-K are forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to
factors related to (i) the sensitivity of the swimming pool supply business to
weather conditions; (ii) the intense competition and low barriers to entry in
the swimming pool supply industry; (iii) the Company’s ability to identify
appropriate acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms
or successfully integrate acquired businesses; (iv) the sensitivity of the
swimming pool supply business to general economic conditions; (v) the
Company’s ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms and the degree
to which the Company is leveraged; (vi) the risk of fire, safety and casualty
losses and related liabilities claims inherent in the storage of chemicals sold
by the Company; (vii) Year 2000 issues; (viii) the Company’s ability to
remain in compliance with the numerous environmental, health and safety
requirements to which it is subject; and (ix) the other factors discussed in the
Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such factors
could affect the Company’s actual results and could cause such results to
differ materially from the Company’s expectations described above.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors

SCP Pool Corporation

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of SCP Pool
Corporation as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of SCP Pool Corporation at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
the Company changed its method of accounting for start-up costs in 1999.

1.  Organization and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

Description of Business

As of February 16, 2000, SCP Pool Corporation and its wholly
owned subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Company”),
maintained 103 service centers in 34 states, the United Kingdom and France from
which they sell swimming pool equipment, parts and supplies to pool builders,
retail stores and service firms.

During the first and fourth quarters of 1999, the Company made
four acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $25.5 million, which after
the closures of duplicate facilities, added 7 service
centers throughout the Unites States, the United Kingdom and France. The Company
recorded a $4.0 million non-compete agreement and $6.3 million in goodwill in
connection with these acquisitions.

During the first and fourth quarters of 1998, the Company made
two acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $31.2 million. The
acquisitions added 12 service centers throughout the United States and the
United Kingdom. The Company recorded $12.4 million in goodwill in connection
with these acquisitions.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Seasonality and Weather

The Company’s business is highly seasonal. Sales are
substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year when the
Company may incur net losses. The principal external factor affecting the
Company’s business is weather. Unseasonably early or late warming trends
can increase or decrease the length of the pool season, and unseasonably cool
weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming
pool use, installation and maintenance, each of which can adversely affect the
Company’s sales and operating profit.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Financial Instruments

The Company’s carrying value of cash, trade receivables,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to the
short maturity of those instruments. The carrying amount of long-term debt
approximates fair value as it bears interest at variable rates.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Credit Risk

The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its
customers and typically does not require collateral. Receivables are generally
due within 30 days except for winter sales under early-buy programs for which
extended terms are provided. Credit losses have historically been within
management’s expectations.

F-7

1.  Organization and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies (continued)

Inventory

Inventory consists primarily of goods purchased for resale and
is carried at the lower of cost, using the average cost method, or market. At
December 31, 1999 and 1998, the reserve for inventory obsolescence was
approximately $3,040,000 and $3,008,000, respectively. The reserve for inventory
obsolescence at each service center is based upon a number of factors including
aging of the inventory, the experience of the manager at the service center, the
previous inventory management performance of the service center, geographical
location, product offerings and other factors. The Company believes that the
reserve for inventory obsolescence may periodically require adjustment as
changes occur in the above-identified factors.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost. The Company provides
for depreciation principally by the straight-line method over estimated useful
lives of three years for autos and trucks, five to ten years for leasehold
improvements and ten years for furniture and fixtures and machinery and
equipment. Depreciation expense was approximately $1,589,000, $1,335,000 and
$990,000 in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of
net assets acquired and is amortized over periods ranging from 20 to 40 years.
At December 31, 1999 and 1998, accumulated amortization was approximately
$5,702,000 and $4,196,000, respectively. The recoverability of goodwill is
assessed periodically and takes into account whether the goodwill should be
completely or partially written off or the amortization period accelerated. In
evaluating the value and future benefits of goodwill, the recoverability from
operating income is measured. Under this approach, the carrying value of
goodwill would be reduced if it is probable that management’s best estimate
of future operating income before goodwill amortization will be less than the
carrying amount of goodwill over the remaining amortization period. The Company
assesses long-lived assets for impairment under Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Statement No. 121, “Accounting for Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of” (SFAS 121).
Under those rules, goodwill associated with assets acquired in a purchase
business combination is included in impairment evaluations when events or
circumstances exist that indicate the carrying amounts of those assets may not
be recoverable.

Other Assets

Loan financing fees are being amortized over the term of the
related debt. A non-compete agreement is being amortized over its contractual
term, which is five years.

In April 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants issued Statement of Position 98-5, “Reporting on the Costs of
Start-Up Activities” which required capitalized start-up costs to be
written-off at the date of adoption and any future start-up costs be expensed as
incurred. The Company adopted the Statement on January 1, 1999 and wrote off
$863,000, net of a $319,000 tax benefit.

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are determined by the liability method in
accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”
(SFAS 109). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax
purposes. The assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates
and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.

Accounting Policies (continued)

Stock Compensation Arrangements

The Company accounts for its stock compensation arrangements
under the provisions of the Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (APB 25).

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when products are shipped.

2.  Details of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts

Additional information regarding certain balance sheet accounts
is presented below (dollars, in thousands):

F-9

3.  Debt

The components of the Company’s debt were as follows
(dollars, in thousands):

Maturities of long-term debt for the remaining years are
$5,000,000 in 2000, $5,000,000 in 2001, and $17,766,000 in 2002.

The Company’s credit agreement includes, among other
things, covenants which require the Company to maintain minimum levels of
interest coverage and fixed charge coverage and restrict the ability of the
Company and its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make capital expenditures. As
of December 31, 1999, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants
and financial ratio requirements. The Senior Loan Facility expires on
December 31, 2002.

Between February 24, 1999 and March 19, 1999 and
between August 20, 1999 and September 20, 1999, the Company purchased 198,200
and 161,200 shares, respectively, of its common stock pursuant to a share
repurchase program announced in October 1998. Certain intercompany dividends
paid prior to March 19, 1999 by the Company created a covenant default under the
Senior Loan Facility. On March 25, 1999, the lenders under the Senior Loan
Facility waived such defaults in accordance with the provisions of the Senior
Loan Facility.

Substantially all of the assets of the Company are pledged as
collateral for the Senior Revolving Note and the Senior Term Note. Considering
the Company’s borrowing base as of December 31, 1999, the Company had $39.2
million available for borrowing under its Senior Loan Facility, the only
additional credit source currently available to the Company. The Company pays a
quarterly commitment fee of 0.25% per annum of the unused portion of available
credit under the Senior Revolving Note.

The Company’s convertible notes may be converted at any
time through December 31, 2002 into shares of the Company’s common
stock at a conversion price of $0.65 per share. At December 31, 1999, the
conversion of these notes would result in the issuance of 140,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock. The Company has reserved such shares.

5.  Common Stock and Earnings Per Share

In accordance with FASB Statement No. 128, “Earnings per
Share” (SFAS 128), the Company has presented basic earnings per share
computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the period and diluted earnings per share, computed on the basis of the
weighted average number of shares and all dilutive potential shares outstanding
during the year. A reconciliation between basic and diluted weighted average
number of shares outstanding and the related earnings per share calculation is
presented below for each of the years ended December 31 (dollars, in thousands
except per share data):

6. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company leases facilities for its corporate office, service
centers and vehicles under non-cancelable operating leases that expire in
various years through 2007 but which have options to extend for various terms.
Rental expense under such operating leases was approximately $13,463,000 in
1999, $10,563,000 in 1998 and $7,747,000 in 1997. The future minimum lease
payments as of December 31, 1999 related to non-cancelable operating leases
with initial terms of one year or more are set forth below (dollars, in
thousands):

7.  Employee Benefit Plans

The Company’s employees participate in a Company sponsored
savings and retirement plan that provides for discretionary Company
contributions under a profit-sharing provision. Employees who are eligible to
participate in the savings plan are able to contribute a percentage of their
base compensation not to exceed 15%, subject to a dollar limit. The Company
contributes an amount equal to 25% of employee contributions up to 6% of their
base compensation. Employee contributions are invested in certain equity and
fixed income securities based on employee elections. Matching contributions and
profit-sharing contributions made by the Company were $330,000 and $733,000,
respectively in 1999, $272,000 and $1,100,000, respectively in 1998, and
$197,000 and $934,000, respectively in 1997.

F-12

8.  Stock Option Plans

The 1995 Stock Option Plan (the “1995 Plan”)
authorized the Board to grant, at its discretion, to employees, agents,
consultants or independent contractors of the Company, options to purchase
shares of common stock. The number of shares granted under this plan was limited
to an aggregate amount of 900,000 shares. Granted options have an exercise price
of not less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant.
Options generally are exercisable two years after the date of grant and expire
December 31, 2008. In May 1998, the 1995 Plan was suspended. This action
had no effect on options granted prior to the suspension.

In May 1998, the shareholders approved the 1998 Stock Option
Plan (the “1998 Plan”) which authorizes the Board to grant, at its
discretion, options to purchase shares of common stock, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock and performance awards to employees, agents,
consultants or independent contractors of the Company. The number of shares
authorized for issuance under the 1998 Plan is limited to 1,125,000 shares of
which 846,000 shares were available for grant as of December 31, 1999. Granted
options usually have an exercise price of not less than the fair market value of
the stock on the date of grant. During 1999, the Company granted 283,000 options
to its employees and officers. Of those options, the Company granted 62,500
stock options at $0.01 per share to the executive officers and certain senior
managers. Options generally are exercisable two or more years after the date of
grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. Total compensation expense
for options granted below market price was $549,000 for the year ended December
31, 1999.

The SCP Pool Corporation Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive
Plan permits the Board to grant to each non-employee director options to
purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The number of shares granted
under this plan is limited to an aggregate amount of 450,000 shares. During
1999, the Company granted 28,000 options to its directors. The options will have
an exercise price of not less than the fair market value of the stock on the
date of grant and generally are exercisable one year after the date of grant and
expire ten years after the date of grant.

In March 1998, the Company’s Board adopted the SCP Pool
Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). Under the plan,
eligible employees may be granted rights to purchase up to an aggregate of
900,000 shares of common stock. Rights are exercisable at 85% of the applicable
market value provided that this value is greater than book value per share. If
85% of the applicable market value is less than book value per share, rights are
exercisable at book value per share. The applicable market value, as defined, is
the lower of either the closing price of the Company’s stock at the end of
a six month period or the average of the beginning and ending closing prices of
the Company’s stock at the end of a six month period. Book value per share
is determined as of the most recent audited consolidated balance sheet date.
There were 12,500 shares issued in 1999 under the ESPP.

FASB Statement No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (SFAS 123) requires the Company to disclose pro forma
information regarding net income and earnings per share as if the Company had
accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method. The fair
value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

8.  Stock Option Plans (continued)

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use
in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company’s employee stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimate, in management’s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock
options.

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value
of the options is amortized to expense over the options vesting period. Had the
Company’s stock based compensation plan been determined based on the fair
value at the grant dates, the Company’s net income and earnings per share
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below (dollars, in
thousands except per share data):
