PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Symantec is the world leader in providing a wide range of
solutions to help individuals and enterprises assure the
security, availability, and integrity of their information
technology, or IT, infrastructure as well as the information
itself. We primarily operate in two growing, diversified markets
within the software sector: the secure content management market
and the storage software market. The secure content management
market includes products that protect consumers and enterprises
from threats to personal computers, or PCs, computer networks,
and electronic information. The storage software market includes
products that archive, protect, and recover business-critical
data. We believe that these markets are converging as customers
increasingly require both secure content management and storage
solutions in order to safeguard their IT infrastructure,
information, and interactions.

Our mission is to provide solutions that help protect the
connected experience of our enterprise and consumer customers.
Our goal is to be the leading supplier of security and
availability software to the enterprise and consumer markets,
and to provide customers in both markets with greater confidence
that their information is secure and readily available. We
strive to help our customers manage compliance, complexity, and
cost by protecting their IT infrastructure as they seek to
maximize value from their IT investments.

In the ever-changing threat landscape and increasingly complex
IT environment for consumers and enterprises alike, we believe
product differentiation will be the key to sustaining market
leadership. Thus, we continually work to enhance the features
and functionality of our existing products, extend our product
leadership, and create innovative solutions for our customers.
We focus on generating profitable and sustainable growth through
internal research and development, licensing from third parties,
and acquisitions of companies with leading technologies.

On July 2, 2005, we completed our acquisition of Veritas
Software Corporation, a leading provider of software and
services to enable storage and backup, in a stock transaction
valued at $13.2 billion. This acquisition has provided us
with the opportunity to redefine protection beyond security to
include comprehensive protection of information and applications
and more effective management and control of computing and
storage environments from the desktop to the data center for
individuals and organizations of all sizes. As a result of this
acquisition, we believe we are better positioned to help
customers build a resilient IT infrastructure, cost effectively
manage a complex IT environment, and reduce overall IT risk.
During fiscal 2006, excluding Veritas, we completed acquisitions
of five privately-held companies and one public company for an
aggregate of $627 million in cash.

With revenue of $4.1 billion in fiscal 2006, Symantec ranks
among the top four independent software companies in the world.
We have operations in 40 countries. Founded in 1982, we are
incorporated in Delaware. Our principal executive offices are
located at 20330 Stevens Creek Blvd, Cupertino, California
95014. Our telephone number at that location is
(408) 517-8000. Our home page on the Internet is

www.symantec.com

. Other than the information
expressly set forth in this annual report, the information
contained, or referred to, on our website is not part of this
annual report.

Industry

The secure content management market consists of antivirus,
messaging security, web filtering, and anti-spyware products and
services. Security threats continue to evolve from traditional
viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other vulnerabilities, to
more recent threats such as phishing (attacks that use spoofed
websites and emails designed to record keystrokes or to fool
recipients into divulging personal financial data), email fraud,
and identity theft. This evolution is a key driver of our
research and development and acquisition strategies, as we
continually differentiate our solutions from the competition and
address our customers’ changing needs.



As a result of the Veritas acquisition, we have gained market
share in the storage software market and are now the leading
supplier of hardware-independent storage software. The worldwide
storage software market consists of storage management, server
and application management, backup and archiving, and
infrastructure software products and services. Demand in this
market is driven by the ever-increasing quantity of data being
collected, the need for data to be protected, recoverable, and
accessible at all times, and the need for a growing number of
critical applications to be continuously available and highly
performing.

Other factors driving demand in this market include the increase
in the number of Internet users and companies conducting
business online, the continuous automation of business
processes, increased pressures on companies to lower storage and
server management costs while simultaneously increasing the
utilization and performance of their existing IT infrastructure,
and the increasing importance of document retention and
regulatory compliance solutions.

Statements. For information regarding the amount and percentage
of our revenue contributed in each of our product categories and

Condition and Results of Operations.

Operating Segments and Products

As of March 31, 2006, we viewed our business in six
operating segments: Consumer Products, Enterprise Security, Data
Protection, Storage and Server Management, Services, and Other.
The Other segment is comprised of sunset products and products
nearing the end of their life cycle and also includes all
indirect costs; general and administrative expenses;
amortization of acquired product rights, other intangible
assets, and other assets; and charges, such as acquired
in-process research and development, patent settlement,
amortization of deferred compensation, and restructuring, that
are not charged to the other operating segments. We report the
expenses of the former Veritas sales force that cannot be
allocated to a specific operating segment in the Other segment.

Beginning in the June 2006 quarter, we will consolidate our
Enterprise Security, Data Protection, and Storage and Server
Management segments into two segments — the Security
and Data Management segment and the Data Center Management
segment.

Consumer Products

Our Consumer Products segment focuses on delivering our Internet
security and problem-solving products to individual users, home
offices, and small businesses. Our Norton brand of consumer
security software solutions provides protection for Windows and
Macintosh platforms as well as personal digital assistants, or
PDAs, and smartphones. Nearly 90% of our sales within the
Consumer Products segment consist of products providing
protection from virus attacks.

Many of Symantec’s consumer products include an ongoing
commitment to provide product technology and feature updates
throughout the typical

12-month

term of the
subscription, to help ensure

up-to

-the-minute
protection against the latest threats. Most of the products that
we are currently marketing or developing feature
LiveUpdate

tm

functionality, which automatically updates these products with
the latest technology, virus definitions, firewall rules,
Uniform Resource Locator, or URL, databases, and uninstall
scripts.

The revenue base for our consumer products segment expanded
significantly during fiscal 2003 through 2005. We believe
comparable growth rates will be difficult to achieve in future
periods. During fiscal 2006, the growth rate of our consumer
business slowed considerably, impacted by a changing threat
environment, a change in our revenue recognition model driven by
increases in future subscription pricing for our 2006 consumer
products that include content updates, and a strengthening
dollar.



Our primary consumer products are:

For most of our consumer products, we translate the
documentation, software, and packaging into the local language
and prepare marketing programs tailored for each local market.

Enterprise Security

Our Enterprise Security segment provides security solutions for
all tiers of a network: at the server tier behind the gateway
and at the client tier, including desktop PCs, laptops, and
handhelds. Our comprehensive software and appliance solutions
include virus protection and content filtering, antispam,
endpoint security, firewall and virtual private networking, or
VPN, intrusion protection, policy compliance, security
management, managed security services, and early warning
services.

Our technology offerings include integrated solutions at the
gateway and client levels, including Symantec Client Security
and Symantec Gateway Security, which combine several of our
security and early warning solutions. At the gateway level, our
products run on Windows NT, Solaris, and Linux platforms.
At the server level, our products operate on Windows NT,
UNIX, Linux, and other key server platforms. At the client
level, our products run on the Windows platform.

Our primary enterprise security solutions address the following
areas:

Antivirus

Nearly 75% of our sales within the Enterprise Security segment
consist of solutions providing protection from virus attacks,
including Symantec AntiVirus, Symantec Client Security, and
Symantec Mail Security. Users of our virus protection and
filtering products are able to protect their computer networks
from both known and unknown risks associated with the use of
Internet resources. Our enterprise antivirus products scan or
monitor data that enters, leaves, or travels inside the
organization, and can detect and eliminate malicious code that
may be introduced into a company’s network.

Antispam

Our antispam solutions protect more than 300 million email
user accounts worldwide from unwanted email known as spam. They
provide a multi-layered approach to combating spam, with
solutions that sit outside the gateway, at the gateway, and at
the desktop. The Symantec Mail Security software, appliance, and



hosted solutions include technology that leverages more than 20
spam protection techniques, delivering antispam effectiveness
rates of up to 95% and one of the industry’s highest
accuracy rates against false positives, or legitimate email
mistakenly categorized as spam.

Compliance

We provide a number of solutions to help customers simplify and
sustain compliance with various government regulations, industry
standards, and internal policies. Our compliance solutions
provide IT administrators a consolidated view of IT compliance
across multiple mandates, proactive and reliable IT controls to
retain and secure information, and actionable intelligence to
provide ongoing compliance. Our solutions include Symantec
Enterprise Security Manager, Symantec
BindView

tm

Policy Manager, and Symantec
Sygate

tm

Network Access Control. These solutions help automate the
management of deviations from security configurations and
standards. In addition, they help customers lower the cost of
compliance through automated assessment of policies against
industry regulations and best practices and they help enforce IT
security policies throughout the enterprise network.

Managed Security Services

Symantec Managed Security Services are designed to allow
enterprise IT organizations to cost-effectively outsource their
security management, monitoring, and response needs. Our
comprehensive service offerings leverage the knowledge of
Internet security experts to protect the value of an
organization’s networked assets and infrastructure. We
provide remote monitoring and management of vendor neutral
firewall and VPN solutions; real-time monitoring and analysis of
intrusion detection alerts; coordinated event monitoring,
analysis, and management of Symantec security appliances; and
integrated global intelligence services from our early warning
solutions.

Data Protection

Our Data Protection segment provides software solutions designed
to protect, backup, archive, and restore data across a broad
range of computing environments, from large corporate data
centers to remote groups and PC clients, such as desktop and
laptop computers. Approximately 90% of our sales in the Data
Protection segment consist of backup and recovery products. At
the gateway and server levels, our products monitor systems for
patterns of misuse and abuse and can warn organizations before
systems are misused or information is stolen.

Email archiving is the fastest growing area in this segment. Our
strength in the email archiving market is driven by robust
customer demand for regulatory compliance solutions and
technology that helps to better manage the email and broader
messaging environment.

Our primary data protection products are:



Storage and Server Management

Our Storage and Server Management segment provides solutions to
simplify and automate the administration of heterogeneous
storage and server environments and provide continuous
availability of mission-critical applications. These solutions
support all major server and storage hardware platforms, helping
organizations reduce the complexity of their enterprise data
centers, improve service levels, and reduce operation costs.

Our storage management solutions allow customers to more easily
manage the growing data volumes associated with enterprise
applications, optimize the availability of data for such
applications, discover and control storage hardware assets, and
improve the utilization of storage hardware.

Our server management solutions simplify and automate the
administration and management of an organization’s server
and application infrastructure. These solutions include
configuration management to discover what software is running on
data center servers and how those servers are inter-related,
provisioning to deploy software onto servers in an automated
fashion, and clustering software to help ensure that
mission-critical applications are always available.

Our client management solutions address enterprise needs for
patch management, configuration management, and asset management
at the client tier. They help protect networked systems from
known vulnerabilities by testing and deploying software patches.
They also simplify repetitive IT tasks such as configuring,
partitioning, provisioning, managing, deploying, and migrating
PCs across the enterprise. In addition, they help IT managers
discover, inventory, and track hardware and software assets
while ensuring license compliance and secure disposal.

Our primary storage and server management products are:



Services

Our Services segment provides a full range of consulting and
educational services to assist our customers in assessing,
architecting, implementing, supporting, and maintaining their
security, storage, and infrastructure software solutions. These
services help our customers plan for the management and control
of enterprise computing in their specific computing environments.

The primary classes of service that we offer are:

Sales and Channel Strategy

Consumer Products

We sell our consumer products to individuals and small
offices/home offices globally through a multi-tiered network of
distribution partners. Our strategy is to place our products in
a variety of channels where consumers might consider purchasing
security and problem-solving solutions.

Our products are available to customers through channels that
include distributors, retailers, direct marketers,
Internet-based resellers, original equipment manufacturers, or
OEMs, educational institutions, and Internet Service Providers,
or ISPs. We separately sell annual content update subscriptions
directly to end users primarily through the Internet. We also
sell some of our products and product upgrades in conjunction
with channel partners through direct mail/email and over the
Internet.

Sales in the Consumer Products business are trending more
towards our electronic channels which are comprised of online
stores, including our Symantec store, and OEM and ISP
relationships. During fiscal 2006, nearly 65% of revenue in the
Consumer Products segment came from our electronic channels. We
also made infrastructure improvements in order to capture more
direct renewal business from customers originally reached
through these channels. In fiscal 2006, we partnered with more
than 150 ISPs and 50 OEMs around the world.

During fiscal 2006, we began offering multi-year consumer
subscriptions in order to deliver new technology capability and
functionality to our customers throughout the year, rather than
only once a year. We



believe these changes allow us to be more competitive and better
protect our customers in the ever-changing computing environment.

Enterprise Solutions

We sell and market our products and related services to
enterprise customers both directly and through a variety of
indirect sales channels, which include value-added resellers, or
VARs, distributors, system integrators, or SIs, and OEMs. Our
enterprise customers include many leading global corporations,
small and medium-sized businesses, and many government agencies
around the world. Many of our products involve a consultative,
solution-oriented sales model. Thus, our sales efforts are
targeted to senior executives and IT department personnel who
are responsible for managing a company’s IT initiatives.

Our primary method of demand generation for enterprise customers
is through our direct sales force. We ended fiscal 2006 with
approximately 4,000 individuals in our sales force,
approximately half of whom joined us as a result of the Veritas
acquisition. Account managers are responsible for customer
relationships and opportunity management and are supported by
product and services specialists. During the June 2006 quarter,
we expect to further integrate the Symantec and Veritas sales
forces as we move towards a single account manager per major
account.

We complement our direct sales efforts with indirect sales
channels such as resellers, VARs, distributors, and SIs,
primarily to address the small to medium-sized enterprise
market. We sell our products through authorized distributors in
more than 40 countries throughout the world. Our top
distributors are Ingram Micro, Inc. and Tech Data Product
Management, Inc.

Another important element of our Enterprise Solutions strategy
involves our relationships with OEM partners that incorporate
our products into their products, bundle our products with their
products, or serve as authorized resellers of our products.

During fiscal 2006, our enterprise antivirus products
experienced increased competition as negotiations for new and
renewal business were consistently aggressive, especially in the
small and medium business market.

Marketing and Advertising

The majority of our marketing dollars is spent on advertising
and promotion, which includes demand generation and brand
recognition of our consumer products and enterprise solutions.
Our advertising and promotion efforts include, but are not
limited to, electronic and print advertising, trade shows,
collateral production, and all forms of direct marketing. To a
lesser extent, we engage in cooperative marketing campaigns with
distributors, resellers, and industry partners.

We continually conduct market research to understand evolving
customer needs and buying behaviors. We also communicate with
customers through the Symantec website, regularly scheduled
web-based seminars and online newsletters, as well as through
direct mailings, both physical and electronic, to existing
end-users and prospects.

Other marketing activities include the production of brochures,
sales tools, multi-media product demonstrations, packaging, and
other collateral as well as participation in focused trade and
computer shows, sponsorship of industry analyst conferences, and
execution of Symantec road shows, seminars, and user group
conferences.

We typically offer two types of rebate programs within most
countries: volume incentive rebates to channel partners and
promotional rebates to distributors and end-users. Distributors
and resellers earn volume incentive rebates primarily based upon
product sales to end-users. We also offer rebates to individual
users that purchase various products through various resale
channels.

We regularly offer upgrade rebates to consumers purchasing a new
version of a product. Both volume incentive rebates and end-user
rebates are accrued as an offset to revenue.



Support

We maintain centralized support facilities throughout the world
that provide rapid,

around-the

-clock
responses to complex customer inquiries. We have support
facilities with experts in technical areas associated with the
products we produce and the operating environments in which
these products are deployed by many of our customers. Our
technical support experts provide customers with information on
product implementation and usage, as well as countermeasures and
identification tools for new threats. Support is available in
multiple languages including Dutch, English, French, German,
Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese, and Spanish.

Our Security Response Team consists of dedicated intrusion
experts, security engineers, virus hunters, and members of the
global technical support teams that work in tandem to provide
extensive coverage for enterprises and consumers. Symantec
Security Response provides customers with comprehensive and
global Internet security expertise, 24 hours a day, seven
days a week, to guard against today’s multi-faceted
Internet threats. The Symantec Security Response Team issues a
semi-annual Internet Security Threat report that provides an
analysis and discussion of trends in Internet attacks,
vulnerabilities, malicious code activity, and other security
risks. We believe that this report is one of the most
comprehensive sources of Internet threat data in the world,
leveraging unparalleled sources to identify emerging trends in
attacks and malicious code activity.

Our enterprise security support program offers annual support
contracts to enterprise customers worldwide, including content,
upgrades, and technical support. Our standard technical support
includes the following:

Our consumer product support program provides free self-help
online services and free email support to all consumer customers
worldwide. A team of product experts, editors, and language
translators are dedicated to maintaining the robustness of the
online knowledge base. Generally, telephone product support is
provided for a fee by an outside vendor. Customers that
subscribe to LiveUpdate receive automatic downloads of the
latest virus definitions, application bug fixes, and patches for
most of our consumer products.

Customers

Our solutions are used worldwide by individual and enterprise
customers in a wide variety of industries, small and
medium-sized enterprises, as well as various governmental
entities. In fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, two distributors,
Ingram Micro and Tech Data Product Management, including their
subsidiaries, each accounted for more than 10% of our total net
revenues. In fiscal 2006 and 2005, one reseller, Digital River,
Inc., represented more than 10% of our total net revenues.

Research and Development

We believe that technical leadership is essential to our
success. Therefore, we expect to continue to commit substantial
resources to research and development. Whether we maintain our
technical leadership position will largely depend on our ability
to enhance existing products, respond to changing customer
requirements, and develop and introduce new products in a timely
manner.

The Symantec Security Response Team is responsible for a
significant component of our research and development efforts.
Our Security Response experts, located at research centers
throughout the world, are focused on collecting and analyzing
the latest malware threats, ranging from network security
threats and vulnerabilities to viruses and worms. When a new
threat or vulnerability is discovered, our Security Response
experts provide a rapid emergency response that consists of
communication with customers and delivery of



security updates for our security products. To simplify and
speed up the delivery of security updates for our product
offerings at the server, gateway, and desktop levels, we use our
LiveUpdate technology.

Outside of our Security Response research centers, other major
research and development initiatives for storage and
availability products include:

Symantec Research Labs, or SRL, is a division within our company
designed to foster new technologies and products to help us
maintain leadership in existing markets. A key component of the
SRL is our Advanced Concepts group, which is focused on
identifying new markets and quickly transforming ideas into
products for those markets.

Independent contractors are used for various aspects of the
product development process. In addition, elements of some of
our products are licensed from third parties.

We had research and development expenses, exclusive of
in-process research and development associated with
acquisitions, of $665 million in fiscal 2006,
$332 million in fiscal 2005, and $252 million in
fiscal 2004. We believe that technical leadership is essential
to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial
resources to research and development.

Acquisitions

Our strategic technology acquisitions are designed to enhance
the features and functionality of our existing products, as well
as extend our product leadership. We use strategic acquisitions
to provide certain technology, people, and products for our
overall product and services strategy. We consider both time to
market and potential market share gains when evaluating
acquisitions of technologies, product lines, or companies. We
have completed a number of acquisitions of technologies,
companies, and products in the past, and we have also disposed
of technologies and products. We may acquire and/or dispose of
other technologies, companies, and products in the future.

During fiscal 2006, we completed the acquisition of Veritas, as
well as acquisitions of the following six other companies:



For further discussion of our acquisitions, see Note 3 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Competition

Our markets are highly competitive and are subject to rapid
changes in technology. Our competitiveness depends on our
ability to deliver products that meet our customers’ needs
by enhancing our existing solutions and services and offering
reliable, scalable, and standardized new solutions on a timely
basis. We believe that the principal competitive factors
necessary to be successful in our industry also include quality,
integration of advanced technology, time to market, price,
reputation, financial stability, breadth of product offerings,
customer support, brand recognition, and effective sales and
marketing efforts.

In addition to the competition we face from direct competitors,
we face indirect or potential competition from operating system
providers and network equipment and computer hardware
manufacturers, who may provide various solutions and functions
in their current and future products. We also compete for access
to



retail distribution channels and for the attention of customers
at the retail level and in corporate accounts. In addition, we
compete with other software companies, operating system
providers, and network equipment and computer hardware
manufacturers to acquire products or companies and to publish
software developed by third parties.

The competitive environments in which each segment operates are
described below:

Consumer Products

Some of the channels in which our consumer products are offered
are highly competitive. Our competitors are sometimes intensely
focused on customer acquisition, which has led such competitors
to offer their technology for free, engage in aggressive
marketing, or enter into competitive partnerships. During fiscal
2006, pricing for subscriptions increased, while pricing in
retail and online stores remained consistent or decreased.

Our primary competitors in the Consumer Products segment are
Microsoft Corporation, McAfee, Inc., and Trend Micro,
Incorporated. During fiscal 2006, Microsoft launched the beta
version of a security suite that will compete with our consumer
products. This security suite includes anti-spyware and
antivirus features, and a backup utility. In addition, Microsoft
has recently added security features to new versions of its
operating system products that provide some of the same
functions offered in our products.

Enterprise Security

In the Enterprise Security markets, we compete against many
companies that offer competing products to our technology
solutions and competing services to our response and support
services. Our primary competitors in Enterprise Security are
McAfee, Trend Micro, CA, Inc., Internet Security Systems, Inc.,
and Cisco Systems, Inc. In the managed security services
segment, our primary competitors are VeriSign, Inc. and
International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM. Recent
acquisitions by Microsoft are indicators of its move into the
Enterprise Security market and could lead to the inclusion of
antivirus and antispyware functionality in future versions of
its operating system products or to its release of stand-alone
enterprise products.

With core antivirus being a required solution for enterprises of
all sizes, we believe that product differentiation is essential
for us to maintain our leadership position. We are focused on
integrating next generation technology capabilities into our
solution set in order to differentiate ourselves from the
competition.

Data Protection

The market for Data Protection products is characterized by
ongoing technological innovation. Many of our strategic partners
offer software products that compete with our products or have
announced their intention to focus on developing or acquiring
their own backup, archive, and data restoration software
products. Our primary competitors in the Data Protection segment
are IBM, CA, and EMC Corporation.

Storage and Server Management

The markets for Storage and Server Management are intensely
competitive. In the areas of storage management solutions,
application and server management, remote management, imaging
provisioning, and asset management, our primary competitors are
EMC, Sun Microsystems, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, IBM,
Oracle Corporation, and Microsoft.

Services

We believe that the principal competitive factors for our
Services segment include technical capability, customer
responsiveness, and our ability to hire and retain talented and
experienced services personnel. Our primary competitors in the
Services segment are IBM, Electronic Data Systems Corporation,
and EMC.



Intellectual Property

Protective Measures

We regard some of the features of our internal operations,
software, and documentation as proprietary and rely on
copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws,
confidentiality procedures, contractual arrangements, and other
measures to protect our proprietary information. Our
intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that
enables us to gain recognition for our products, services, and
technology and enhance our competitive position.

As part of our confidentiality procedures, we generally enter
into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, distributors,
and corporate partners and we enter into license agreements with
respect to our software, documentation, and other proprietary
information. These license agreements are generally
non-transferable and have a perpetual term. We also educate our
employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to
protect our facilities, equipment, and networks.

Trademarks, Patents, Copyrights, and Licenses

Symantec and the Symantec logo are trademarks or registered
trademarks in the U.S. and other countries. In addition to
Symantec and the Symantec logo, we have used, registered, and/or
applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks
to help distinguish our products, technologies, and services
from those of our competitors in the U.S. and foreign countries
and jurisdictions. We enforce our trademark, service mark, and
trade name rights in the U.S. and abroad. The duration of our
trademark registrations varies from country to country, and in
the U.S., we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights
and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the
trademarks are in use.

We have a number of U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending
patent applications, including patents and rights to patent
applications acquired through strategic transactions, which
relate to various aspects of our products and technology. The
duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country
of issuance and for the U.S. is typically 17 years
from the date of issuance of the patent or 20 years from
the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the
patent, which we believe is adequate relative to the expected
lives of our products.

Our products are protected under U.S. and international
copyright laws and laws related to the protection of
intellectual property and proprietary information. We take
measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary
rights notices and we actively enforce such rights in the U.S.
and abroad. However, these measures may not provide sufficient
protection, and our intellectual property rights may be
challenged. In addition, we license some intellectual property
from third parties for use in our products, and generally must
rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual
property rights. While we believe that our ability to maintain
and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our
success, we also believe that our business as a whole is not
materially dependent on any particular patent, trademark,
license, or other intellectual property right.

Seasonality

As is typical for many large software companies, a part of our
business is seasonal. Software license orders are generally
higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our
first and second fiscal quarters. A significant decline in
license orders is typical in the first quarter of our fiscal
year when compared to license orders in the fourth quarter of
the prior fiscal year. In addition, we generally receive a
higher volume of software license orders in the last month of a
quarter, with orders concentrated in the later part of that
month. We believe that this seasonality primarily reflects
customer spending patterns and budget cycles, as well as the
impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel.
Software license revenue generally reflects similar seasonal
patterns but to a lesser extent than license orders because
license revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped and
other revenue recognition criteria are met.



Employees

As of March 31, 2006, we employed approximately 16,000
people worldwide, approximately 58% of whom reside in the
U.S. Approximately 8,000 employees work in sales,
marketing, and related activities; 5,000 in product development;
1,000 in services; and 2,000 in management, manufacturing, and
administration.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

If we are unable to develop
new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread
market acceptance, or if we are unable to continually improve
the performance, features, and reliability of our existing
products and services, our business and operating results could
be adversely affected.

Our future success depends on our ability to respond to the
rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or
introducing new products, product upgrades, and services on a
timely basis. We have in the past incurred, and will continue to
incur, significant research and development expenses as we
strive to remain competitive. New product development and
introduction involves a significant commitment of time and
resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges
including:

If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges,
or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not
technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance,
we could have expended substantial resources and capital without
realizing sufficient revenues in return, and our business and
operating results could be adversely affected.



Fluctuations in demand for
our products and services are driven by many factors and a
decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our
financial results.

We are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and
services due to a variety of factors, including competition,
product obsolescence, technological change, budget constraints
of our actual and potential customers, level of broadband usage,
awareness of security threats to IT systems, and other factors.
While such factors may, in some periods, increase product sales,
fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product
sales. For example, until recently we had experienced a higher
than expected rate of growth in sales of our consumer security
products that we believe was spurred, in part, by several
well-publicized threats to computer security. As consumer
attention to security threats fluctuates, the growth rates in
sales of consumer security products have been impacted. If
demand for our products declines, our revenues and gross margin
could be adversely affected.

We operate in a highly
competitive environment, and our competitors may gain market
share in the markets for our products that could adversely
affect our business and cause our revenues to decline.

We operate in intensely competitive markets that experience
rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards,
changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product
introductions and improvements. If we are unable to anticipate
or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new
competitors gain market share in any of our markets, our
competitive position could weaken and we could experience a drop
in revenues that could adversely affect our business and
operating results. To compete successfully, we must maintain a
successful research and development effort to develop new
products and services and enhance existing products and
services, effectively adapt to changes in the technology or
product rights held by our competitors, appropriately respond to
competitive strategy, and effectively adapt to technological
changes and changes in the ways that our information is
accessed, used, and stored within our enterprise and consumer
markets. If we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors
or to changing technological and customer demands, we could
experience a negative effect on our competitive position and our
financial results.

Our traditional competitors include independent software vendors
which offer software products that directly compete with our
product offerings. In addition to competing with these vendors
directly for sales to end users of our products, we compete with
them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the
product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer
hardware OEMs and ISPs. Our competitors could gain market share
from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products
with the products of our competitors or if they more actively
promote our competitors’ products than our products. In
addition, software vendors who have bundled our products with
theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or
other vendors’ software or may limit our access to standard
product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products
for their platform.

We face growing competition from network equipment and computer
hardware manufacturers and large operating system providers.
These firms are increasingly developing and incorporating into
their products data protection and storage and server management
software that competes at some levels with our product
offerings. Our competitive position could be adversely affected
to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality
incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our
products. Microsoft has added remote access features to its
operating systems and has made announcements of actual and
anticipated product features and new product offerings that
compete with a number of our product offerings. In addition, we
believe that Microsoft has recently made changes to its
operating systems that make it more difficult for independent
security vendors to provide effective solutions for their
customers. We could be adversely affected if customers,
particularly consumers, perceive that features incorporated into
the Microsoft operating system reduce the need for our products
or if they prefer to purchase other Microsoft products that are
bundled with its operating systems and compete with our products.

Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical,
sales, marketing, or other resources than we do and consequently
may have an ability to influence customers to purchase their
products instead of ours. We



also face competition from many smaller companies that
specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we
compete.

If we fail to manage our
sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners
choose not to market and sell our products to their customers,
our operating results could be adversely affected.

We sell our consumer products to individuals and small
offices/home offices around the world through multi-tiered sales
and distribution networks. Sales through these different
channels involve distinct risks, including the following:

Direct Sales.

A significant portion of our revenues from
    enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales
    force to end-users. Special risks associated with this sales
    channel include:

•

Longer sales cycles associated with direct sales efforts

•

Difficulty in hiring, retaining, and motivating our direct sales
    forces

•

Substantial amounts of training for sales representatives to
    become productive, including regular updates to cover new and
    revised products

Indirect Sales Channels.

A significant portion of our
    revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels,
    including distributors that sell our products to end-users and
    other resellers. This channel involves a number of risks,
    including:

OEM Sales Channels.

A significant portion of our revenues
    is derived from sales through our OEM partners that incorporate
    our products into, or bundle our products with, their products.
    Our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks,
    including:



If we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels
successfully, these channels may conflict with one another or
otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate, which could reduce
our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our
competitive position. Some of our distribution partners have
experienced financial difficulties in the past, and if our
partners suffer financial difficulties in the future, we may
have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could
adversely affect our operating results. In addition, reliance on
multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause
unpredictability in demand, which could increase the risk that
we may be unable to plan effectively for the future, and could
result in adverse operating results in future periods.

We have grown, and may
continue to grow, through acquisitions that give rise to risks
and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial
results.

We have in the past acquired, and we expect to acquire in the
future, other businesses, business units, and technologies.
Acquisitions involve a number of special risks and challenges,
including:

Integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be
a complex, time consuming, and expensive process, and can impact
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. For example, as disclosed in Item 9A in this
annual report, our management has identified a material weakness
in our internal control over financial reporting that was
largely related to Symantec having insufficient personnel
resources with adequate expertise to properly manage the
increased volume and complexity of income tax matters arising
from the acquisition of Veritas.

If our ongoing integration of the Veritas business is not
successful, we may not realize the potential benefits of the
acquisition or could undergo other adverse effects that we
currently do not foresee. To integrate acquired businesses, we
must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations
and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired
operations. We also must effectively integrate the different
cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a
way that aligns various interests, and may need to enter new
markets in which we have no or limited experience and where
competitors in such markets have stronger market positions.

Any of the foregoing, and other factors, could harm our ability
to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired
businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of
acquisitions. In addition, because acquisitions of high
technology companies are inherently risky, no assurance can be
given that our previous or future acquisitions will be
successful and will not adversely affect our business, operating
results, or financial condition.



Our international operations
involve risks that could increase our expenses, adversely affect
our operating results, and require increased time and attention
of our management.

We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers
located outside of the U.S. and we have significant operations
outside of the U.S., including engineering, sales, customer
support, and production. We plan to expand our international
operations, but such expansion is contingent upon the financial
performance of our existing international operations as well as
our identification of growth opportunities. Our international
operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by
our domestic operations, including:

A significant portion of our transactions outside of the
U.S. are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly,
our future operating results will continue to be subject to
fluctuations in foreign currency rates. We may be negatively
affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the
future, especially if international sales continue to grow as a
percentage of our total sales.

We receive significant tax benefits from sales to our

non-U.S.

customers.
These benefits are contingent upon existing tax regulations in
the U.S. and in the countries in which our international
operations are located. Future changes in domestic or
international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability
to continue to realize these tax benefits.

Our products are complex and
operate in a wide variety of computer configurations, which
could result in errors or product failures.

Because we offer very complex products, undetected errors,
failures, or bugs may occur, especially when products are first
introduced or when new versions are released. Our products are
often installed and used in



large-scale computing environments with different operating
systems, system management software, and equipment and
networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures in
our products or may expose undetected errors, failures, or bugs
in our products. Our customers’ computing environments are
often characterized by a wide variety of standard and
non-standard configurations that make pre-release testing for
programming or compatibility errors very difficult and
time-consuming. In addition, despite testing by us and others,
errors, failures, or bugs may not be found in new products or
releases until after commencement of commercial shipments. In
the past, we have discovered software errors, failures, and bugs
in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and
have experienced delayed or lost revenues during the period
required to correct these errors.

Errors, failures, or bugs in products released by us could
result in negative publicity, product returns, loss of or delay
in market acceptance of our products, loss of competitive
position, or claims by customers or others. Many of our end-user
customers use our products in applications that are critical to
their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects
in our products than to defects in other, less critical,
software products. In addition, if an actual or perceived breach
of information integrity or availability occurs in one of our
end-user customer’s systems, regardless of whether the
breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of
the effectiveness of our products could be harmed. Alleviating
any of these problems could require significant expenditures of
our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions,
delays, or cessation of our product licensing, which could cause
us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely
affect our operating results.

If we are unable to attract
and retain qualified employees, lose key personnel, fail to
integrate replacement personnel successfully, or fail to manage
our employee base effectively, we may be unable to develop new
and enhanced products and services, effectively manage or expand
our business, or increase our revenues.

Our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and
retain our key management, technical, sales, marketing, finance,
and other critical personnel. Our officers and other key
personnel are employees-at-will, and we cannot assure you that
we will be able to retain them. Competition for people with the
specific skills that we require is significant. In order to
attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace, we
believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package,
including cash and equity-based compensation. The volatility in
our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our
ability to recruit or retain employees. In addition, we may be
unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future
increases in the number of shares available for issuance under
our equity compensation plans, and recent changes in accounting
rules require us to treat the issuance of employee stock options
and other forms of equity-based compensation as compensation
expense. As a result, we may decide to issue fewer equity-based
incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and
retain necessary personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain
qualified employees, or conversely, if we fail to manage
employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by
market conditions, our business and operating results could be
adversely affected.

Key personnel have left our company in the past and there likely
will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time
in the future. The loss of any key employee could result in
significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely
affecting the timeliness of product releases, the successful
implementation and completion of company initiatives, the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our
internal control over financial reporting, and the results of
our operations. In addition, hiring, training, and successfully
integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time
consuming, may cause additional disruptions to our operations,
and may be unsuccessful, which could negatively impact future
revenues.

We are a party to several
class action and derivative action lawsuits, which could require
significant management time and attention and result in
significant legal expenses, and which could, if not determined
favorably, negatively impact our business, financial condition,
results of operations, and cash flows.

We have been named as a party to several class action and
derivative action lawsuits, and we may be named in additional
litigation. The expense of defending such litigation may be
costly and divert manage-



ment’s attention from the

day-to

-day operations
of our business, which could adversely affect our business,
results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, an
unfavorable outcome in such litigation could negatively impact
our business, results of operations, and cash flows.

Third parties claiming that
we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur
significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our
products.

From time to time, we receive claims that we have infringed the
intellectual property rights of others, including claims
regarding patents, copyrights, and trademarks. In addition,
former employers of our former, current, or future employees may
assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to
us the confidential or proprietary information of these former
employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result
in costly litigation and distract management from

day-to

-day operations.
If we are not successful in defending such claims, we could be
required to stop selling, delay shipments of or redesign our
products, pay monetary amounts as damages, enter into royalty or
licensing arrangements, or satisfy indemnification obligations
that we have with some of our customers.

In addition, we license and use software from third parties in
our business. These third party software licenses may not
continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all,
and may expose us to additional liability. This liability, or
our inability to use any of this third party software, could
result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business
that could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

If we do not protect our
proprietary information and prevent third parties from making
unauthorized use of our products and technology, our financial
results could be harmed.

Our software and underlying technology are proprietary. We seek
to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of
confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright,
patent, trademark, and trade secret laws. However, all of these
measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged,
invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. Third parties may
copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain, use,
distribute, and sell our proprietary information without
authorization. Third parties may also develop similar or
superior technology independently, by designing around our
patents. Our shrink-wrap license agreements are not signed by
licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of
some jurisdictions. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign
countries do not offer the same level of protection of our
proprietary rights as the laws of the U.S., and we may be
subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries.
The unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary
information could result in reduced sales of our products. Any
legal action to protect proprietary information that we may
bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could
adversely affect our ability to access software, operating
system, and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor, or
cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products
to their customers. In addition, any legal action to protect
proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in,
alone or through our alliances with the Business Software
Alliance (BSA), or the Software & Information Industry
Association (SIIA), could be costly, may distract management
from

day-to

-day
operations, and may lead to additional claims against us, which
could adversely affect our operating results.

Some of our products contain
“open source” software, and any failure to comply with
the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could
negatively affect our business.

Certain of our products are distributed with software licensed
by its authors or other third parties under so-called “open
source” licenses, which may include, by way of example the
GNU General Public License (GPL), GNU Lesser General Public
License (LGPL), the Mozilla Public License, the BSD License, and
the Apache License. Some of these licenses contain requirements
that we make available source code for modifications or
derivative works we create based upon the open source software,
and that we license such modifications or derivative works under
the terms of a particular open source license or other license
granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we
combine our proprietary software with open source software in a
certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source
licenses, be required to release the source code of our
proprietary software. In addition to risks related to license
requirements, usage of open source software can



lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial
software, as open source licensors generally do not provide
warranties or controls on origin of the software. We have
established processes to help alleviate these risks, including a
review process for screening requests from our development
organizations for the use of open source, but we cannot be sure
that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in
our products. In addition, many of the risks associated with
usage of open source cannot be eliminated, and could, if not
properly addressed, negatively affect our business.

Our software products and
website may be subject to intentional disruption that could
adversely impact our reputation and future sales.

Although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to
prevent intentional disruptions, we expect to be an ongoing
target of attacks specifically designed to impede the
performance of our products. Similarly, experienced computer
programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the
security of our website and misappropriate proprietary
information or cause interruptions of our services. Because the
techniques used by such computer programmers to access or
sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized
until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate
these techniques. Our activities could be adversely affected and
our reputation and future sales harmed if these intentionally
disruptive efforts are successful.

Increased customer demands
on our technical support services may adversely affect our
relationships with our customers and our financial
results.

We offer technical support services with many of our products.
We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate
short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We
also may be unable to modify the format of our support services
to compete with changes in support services provided by
competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers.
Further customer demand for these services, without
corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely
affect our operating results.

We have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide
consumer support functions to third party service providers. If
these companies experience financial difficulties, do not
maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy
our contracts, or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient
level under these contracts, the level of support services to
our customers may be significantly disrupted, which could
materially harm our relationships with these customers.

Accounting charges may cause
fluctuations in our quarterly financial results.

Our financial results have been in the past, and may continue to
be in the future, materially affected by non-cash and other
accounting charges, including:

For example, in connection with our acquisition of Veritas, we
have recorded approximately $2.8 billion of intangible
assets, including acquired product rights, and $8.6 billion
of goodwill. We have recorded and will continue to record future
amortization charges with respect to a portion of these
intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense related
to the stock options to purchase Veritas common stock assumed by
us. In addition, we will evaluate our long-lived assets,
including property and equipment, goodwill, acquired product
rights, and other intangible assets, whenever events or
circumstances occur which indicate that these assets might be
impaired. Goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment in the
fourth quarter of each fiscal year or



more frequently if events and circumstances warrant. The
foregoing types of accounting charges may also be incurred in
connection with or as a result of other business acquisitions.
The price of our common stock could decline to the extent that
our financial results are materially affected by the foregoing
accounting charges.

Our effective tax rate may
increase or fluctuate, which could increase our income tax
expense and reduce our net income.

Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several
factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:

The price of our common stock could decline to the extent that
our financial results are materially affected by an adverse
change in our effective tax rate.

We report our results of operations based on our determinations
of the amount of taxes owed in the various tax jurisdictions in
which we operate. From time to time, we receive notices that a
tax authority to which we are subject has determined that we owe
a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority,
and we are regularly engaged in discussions, and sometimes
disputes, with these tax authorities. We are engaged in disputes
of this nature at this time. If the ultimate determination of
our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in
excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for,
our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could
be adversely affected.

Fluctuations in our
quarterly financial results have affected the price of our
common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in the
future.

Our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and
are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number
of factors, many of which are outside of our control and which
could adversely affect our operations and operating results. In
addition, our acquisition of Veritas makes it more difficult for
us to predict, and securities analysts to develop expectations
regarding, our future financial results due to the risks
associated with the complexity of our combined business and the
integration of our management teams and operations. If our
quarterly financial results or our predictions of future
financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities
analysts and investors, our stock price could be negatively
affected. Any volatility in our quarterly financial results may
make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or
pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock. Our
operating results for prior periods may not be effective
predictors of our future performance.

Factors associated with our industry, the operation of our
business, and the markets for our products may cause our
quarterly financial results to fluctuate, including:



•

Earthquakes, floods, or other natural disasters affecting our
    headquarters located in Silicon Valley, California, an area
    known for seismic activity, or our other locations worldwide

•

Acts of war or terrorism

•

Intentional disruptions by third parties

Any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of
our common stock to fluctuate significantly.

Our stock price may be
volatile in the future, and you could lose the value of your
investment.

The market price of our common stock has experienced significant
fluctuations in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the
future, and as a result you could lose the value of your
investment. The market price of our common stock may be affected
by a number of factors, including:



The stock market in general, and the market prices of stocks of
technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme
price volatility that has adversely affected, and may continue
to adversely affect, the market price of our common stock for
reasons unrelated to our business or operating results.

As of March 31, 2006, there were approximately 5,000
stockholders of record of Symantec common stock. Symantec has
never declared or paid any cash dividends on its capital stock.
We currently intend to retain future earnings for use in our
business, and, therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash
dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future.

We have operated a stock repurchase program since 2001. On
March 28, 2005, the Board of Directors increased the dollar
amount of authorized stock repurchases by $3 billion, which
became effective upon completion of the Veritas acquisition on
July 2, 2005. We commenced repurchases under the
$3 billion authorization on August 2, 2005 and as of
December 31, 2005 all authorized repurchases, including
$474 million from prior authorizations, were completed.

On January 31, 2006, the Board, through one of its
committees, authorized the repurchase of $1 billion of
Symantec common stock, without a scheduled expiration date. In
connection with this stock repurchase authorization, we entered
into Rule

10b5-1

trading plans intended to facilitate stock repurchases of
$125 million per quarter during fiscal 2007. We used
$154 million of the authorized amount to repurchase shares
in the open market in the March 2006 quarter and we intend to
use the remaining amount to make stock repurchases under
Rule

10b5-1

trading plans and opportunistically in fiscal 2007.

In fiscal 2006, we repurchased 174 million shares at prices
ranging from $15.83 to $23.85 for an aggregate amount of
$3.6 billion. In fiscal 2005, we repurchased
eight million shares at prices ranging from $21.05 to
$30.77 per share, for an aggregate amount of
$192 million. In fiscal 2004, we repurchased
three million shares at prices ranging from $19.52 to
$20.82 per share, for an aggregate amount of
$60 million. As of March 31, 2006, $846 million
remained authorized for future repurchases.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW

We are the world leader in providing a wide range of solutions
to help individuals and enterprises assure the security,
availability, and integrity of their information technology, or
IT, infrastructure as well as the information itself. With
innovative technology solutions and services, we help
individuals and enterprises protect and manage their digital
assets. We provide a wide range of solutions including
enterprise and consumer security, data protection, application
and infrastructure management, security management, storage and
server management, and response and managed security services.
Founded in 1982, we have operations in 40 countries worldwide.

We have a

52/53-week

fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references as of and
for the periods ended March 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004
reflect amounts as of and for the periods ended March 31,
2006, April 1, 2005, and April 2, 2004, respectively.
The fiscal accounting years ended March 31, 2006 and
April 1, 2005 are each comprised of 52 weeks of
operations, while the fiscal accounting year ended April 2,
2004 is comprised of 53 weeks of operations. The fiscal
accounting year ending March 30, 2007 will comprise
52 weeks of operations.



Veritas Acquisition

On July 2, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Veritas
Software Corporation, or Veritas, a leading provider of software
and services to enable storage and backup, whereby Veritas
became a wholly owned subsidiary of Symantec in a transaction
accounted for using the purchase method. The total purchase
price of $13.2 billion includes Symantec common stock
valued at $12.5 billion, assumed stock options and
restricted stock units, or RSUs, with a fair value of
$699 million, and acquisition-related expenses of
$39 million. The acquisition of Veritas will enable us to
provide enterprise customers with a more effective way to secure
and manage their most valuable asset, their information. The
combined company offers customers a broad portfolio of leading
software and solutions across all tiers of the infrastructure.
We believe that this acquisition better positions us to help
enable our customers to build a resilient IT infrastructure,
manage a complex heterogeneous IT environment, and reduce
overall IT risk. In addition, we believe that bringing together
the market leading capabilities of Symantec and Veritas improves
our ability to continuously optimize performance and help
companies recover from disruptions when they occur.

As a result of the acquisition, we issued approximately
483 million shares of Symantec common stock, net of
treasury stock retained, options to
purchase 66 million shares of Symantec common stock,
and 425,000 RSUs, based on an exchange ratio of
1.1242 shares of Symantec common stock for each outstanding
share of Veritas common stock as of July 2, 2005. The
common stock issued had a fair value of $12.5 billion and
was valued using the average closing price of our common stock
of $25.87 over a range of trading days (December 14, 2004
through December 20, 2004, inclusive) around the
announcement date (December 16, 2004) of the transaction.
Under the terms of the agreement, we assumed each outstanding
option to purchase Veritas common stock with an exercise price
equal to or less than $49.00, as well as each additional option
required to be assumed by applicable law. Each option assumed
was converted into an option to purchase Symantec common stock
based upon the exchange ratio. All other options to purchase
shares of Veritas common stock not exercised prior to the
acquisition were cancelled immediately prior to the acquisition
and were not converted or assumed by Symantec. In addition, we
assumed all of the Veritas outstanding RSUs and converted them
into 425,000 Symantec RSUs, after applying the exchange ratio.
The assumed options and RSUs had a fair value of
$699 million.

In connection with the acquisition, we have recorded
$8.6 billion of goodwill, $1.3 billion of acquired
product rights, $1.5 billion of other intangible assets,
$63 million of deferred stock-based compensation, and
$2.3 billion of net tangible assets. In addition, we wrote
off acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&D,
of $284 million because the acquired technologies had not
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses.
We also incurred acquisition related expenses of
$39 million, which consisted of $32 million for legal
and other professional fees and $7 million of restructuring
costs for severance, associated benefits, outplacement services,
and excess facilities. The acquisition was structured to qualify
as a tax-free reorganization and we have accounted for it using
the purchase method of accounting. The results of Veritas’
operations have been included in our results of operations
beginning on July 2, 2005, and had a significant impact on
our revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses during
fiscal 2006.

In connection with the acquisition of Veritas, we assumed
Veritas’ contractual obligations related to its deferred
revenue. Veritas’ deferred revenue was derived from
maintenance, consulting, education, and other services. We
estimated our obligation related to Veritas’ deferred
revenue using the cost

build-up

approach. The
cost

build-up

approach
determines fair value by estimating the costs relating to
fulfilling the obligation plus a normal profit margin. The sum
of the costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the
amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume
the support obligation. The estimated costs to fulfill the
support obligation were based on the historical direct costs
related to providing the support. As a result, we recorded an
adjustment to reduce the carrying value of deferred revenue by
$359 million to $173 million, which represents our
estimate of the fair value of the contractual obligations
assumed.

The Veritas business is included in our Data Protection, Storage
and Server Management, and Services segments.



Other fiscal 2006 acquisitions

During fiscal 2006, in addition to Veritas, we completed
acquisitions of five privately-held companies and one public
company for $627 million in cash, including
acquisition-related expenses resulting from financial advisory,
legal and accounting services, duplicate sites, and severance
costs. XtreamLok Pty. Ltd and substantially all of
WholeSecurity, Inc. are included in our Consumer Products
segment, Sygate Technologies, Inc., the remainder of
WholeSecurity, BindView Development Corporation, and IMlogic,
Inc. are included in our Enterprise Security Segment, and
Relicore, Inc. is included in our Storage and Server Management
segment.

Our Business

Our operating segments are significant strategic business units
that offer different products and services, distinguished by
customer needs. As of March 31, 2006, we had six operating
segments:

In the quarter ended September 2005, we renamed the Enterprise
Administration segment to be the Storage and Server Management
segment and added the Data Protection segment. In the quarter
ended June 2005, we moved Managed Security Services from the
Services segment to the Enterprise Security segment and moved
the services-related revenue previously included in the Storage
and Server Management segment to the Services segment. Net
revenues for fiscal 2005 and 2004 have been reclassified to
conform to our current presentation. Specifically, we
reclassified $31 million and $27 million of Managed
Security Services revenue from the Services segment to the
Enterprise Security segment, and $5 million and an
insignificant amount of services-related revenue from the
Storage and Server Management segment to the Services segment
for fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Beginning in the June 2006 quarter, we will consolidate our
Enterprise Security, Data Protection, and Storage and Server
Management segments into two segments — the Security
and Data Management segment and the Data Center Management
segment.



Financial Results

Our net income was $157 million, $536 million, and
$371 million for fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively,
representing diluted net income per share of $0.15, $0.74, and
$0.54, respectively. The decreased profitability in fiscal 2006
is primarily due to the write-off of acquired IPR&D and
increased amortization of acquired product rights and other
intangible assets as a result of the Veritas acquisition, as
well as non-merger related restructuring charges. In addition,
we experienced an increase in operating expenses primarily
attributable to the Veritas acquisition, and specifically an
increase in employee headcount and related compensation. As of
March 31, 2006, employee headcount increased by
approximately 148% from March 31, 2005. Approximately 71%
of the increase was due to the Veritas acquisition.

Fiscal 2006 delivered global revenue growth across all of our
geographic regions as compared to fiscal 2005 and 2004. The
overall growth is due primarily to the Veritas acquisition and
is also partly attributable to increased awareness of Internet
related threats around the world. Weakness in most major foreign
currencies negatively impacted our international revenue growth
by $48 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. We
are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future
periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. If international sales become a greater portion of our
total sales in the future, changes in foreign exchange rates may
have a potentially greater impact on our revenues and operating
results.

In the December 2005 quarter, we released our 2006 consumer
products and increased subscription pricing for those 2006
consumer products that include content updates. As a result,
revenue for the 2006 consumer products that include content
updates is recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the
license. In addition, beginning in the December 2005 quarter,
this revenue is now classified as Content, subscriptions, and
maintenance revenue.

Cash flows were strong in fiscal 2006 as we delivered over
$1.5 billion in operating cash flow. We ended fiscal 2006
with $2.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments.

On April 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 123R,

Share-Based
Payment

. We expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123R to
have a material impact on our consolidated financial position
and results of operations.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and
related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles requires us to make estimates, which include
judgments and assumptions, that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based
our estimates on historical experience and on various
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and
make changes accordingly. Historically, our critical accounting
estimates have not differed materially from actual results;
however, actual results may differ from these estimates under
different conditions. If actual results differ from these
estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts
reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the
resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our
Consolidated Statements of Income, and in certain situations,
could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our
financial condition.

A critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and
assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the
estimate is made. Different estimates that reasonably could have
been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially
impact the financial statements. We believe that the estimates
described below represent our critical accounting estimates, as
they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated
financial statements. We also refer you to our

Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

beginning on page 74 of
this annual report.



Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software
industry. Revenue recognition requirements in the software
industry are very complex and require us to make many estimates.

In arrangements that include multiple elements, including
perpetual software licenses and maintenance and/or services, and
packaged products with content updates, we allocate and defer
revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor-specific
objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered
elements, and recognize the difference between the total
arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered
items as revenue. Our deferred revenue consists primarily of the
unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance and
consumer product content updates and totaled approximately
$2.2 billion as of March 31, 2006, of which
$248 million was presented as Long-term deferred revenue in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. VSOE of each element is based
on the price for which the undelivered element is sold
separately. We determine fair value of the undelivered elements
based on historical evidence of our stand-alone sales of these
elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for
the undelivered elements. When VSOE does not exist for
undelivered items such as maintenance, then the entire
arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance
period. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the
ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of
the respective elements, and changes to a product’s
estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of
recognized and deferred revenue.

For our 2006 consumer products that include content updates, we
recognize revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon
sell through to end users. Associated cost of revenues is also
recorded ratably. We record as deferred revenue and inventory
the respective revenue and cost of revenue amounts of unsold
product held by our distributors and resellers.

We expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate
inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer
demand, which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand
based on recent buying trends. We ship product to our
distributors and resellers at their request and based on their
valid purchase orders. Our distributors and resellers base the
quantity of their orders on their estimates to meet future
customer demand, which may exceed our expected level of a four
or six week supply. We offer limited rights of return if the
inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the
expected level of a four or six week supply. We estimate future
returns under these limited rights of return in accordance with
SFAS, No. 48,

Revenue Recognition When Right of
Return Exists.

We typically offer liberal rights of return
if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the
expected level. Because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount
of excess inventory that will be returned, we primarily offset
Deferred revenue against Trade accounts receivable for the
amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels. If
we made different estimates, material differences may result in
the amount and timing of our net revenues and cost of revenues
for any period presented.

Reserves for product returns

We reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue
based primarily on historical trends. We fully reserve for
obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to
revenue. If we made different estimates, material differences
could result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for
any period presented. More or less product may be returned than
what was estimated and/or the amount of inventory in the channel
could be different than what was estimated. These factors and
unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment
could make actual results differ from our return estimates.

Reserves for rebates

We estimate and record reserves for channel and end-user rebates
as an offset to revenue. For 2006 consumer products that include
content updates, rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to
revenue over the term of the subscription. Our estimated
reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on
distributors’ and resellers’ actual performance
against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate
programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our
reserves for end-user rebates are estimated based on



the terms and conditions of the promotional programs, actual
sales during the promotion, amount of actual redemptions
received, historical redemption trends by product and by type of
promotional program, and the value of the rebate. We also
consider current market conditions and economic trends when
estimating our reserves for rebates. If we made different
estimates, material differences may result in the amount and
timing of our net revenues for any period presented.

Business Combinations

When we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to
tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible
assets acquired. Any residual purchase price is recorded as
goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires
management to make significant estimates in determining the fair
values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially
with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based on
historical experience and information obtained from the
management of the acquired companies. These estimates can
include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is
expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted
average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be
derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently
uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, unanticipated events
and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or
validity of such estimates.

At March 31, 2006, goodwill was $10.3 billion, other
intangible assets, net were $1.4 billion, and acquired
product rights, net were $1.2 billion. We assess the
impairment of goodwill within our reporting units annually, or
more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate goodwill
for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our
reporting units, which are the same as our operating segments,
to its carrying value, including the goodwill allocated to that
reporting unit. To determine the reporting units’ fair
values in the current year evaluation, we used the income
approach under which we calculate the fair value of each
reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash
flows of that unit. Our cash flow assumptions are based on
historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs, and other
relevant factors. If management’s estimates of future
operating results change, or if there are changes to other
assumptions, the estimate of the fair value of our goodwill
could change significantly. Such change could result in goodwill
impairment charges in future periods, which could have a
significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

We assess the impairment of acquired product rights and other
identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying amount may
not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when
the sum of the estimated future cash flows expected to result
from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less
than its carrying amount. Such impairment loss would be measured
as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and
its fair value. Our cash flow assumptions are based on
historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs, and other
relevant factors. If management’s estimates of future
operating results change, or if there are changes to other
assumptions, the estimate of the fair value of our acquired
product rights and other identifiable intangible assets could
change significantly. Such change could result in impairment
charges in future periods, which could have a significant impact
on our consolidated financial statements.

Accounting for Excess Facilities

We have estimated expenses for excess facilities related to
consolidating, moving, and relocating personnel or sites as a
result of restructuring activities and business acquisitions. In
determining our estimates, we obtain information from third
party leasing agents to calculate anticipated third party
sublease income and the vacancy period prior to finding a
sub-lessee. Market conditions may affect our ability to sublease
facilities on terms consistent with our estimates. Our ability
to sublease facilities on schedule or to negotiate lease terms
resulting in higher or lower sublease income than estimated may
affect our accrual for site closures. In addition, differences
between estimated and actual related broker commissions, tenant
improvements, and related exit costs may increase or decrease
our accrual upon final negotiation. If we made different
estimates regarding these various components of our excess
facilities costs, the amount recorded for any period presented
could vary materially from those actually recorded.



Income Taxes

We are required to estimate our income taxes in each federal,
state, and international jurisdiction in which we operate. This
process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as
well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and
tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as
accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax
purposes. The income tax effects of the differences we identify
are classified as current or long-term deferred tax assets and
liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our judgments,
assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for
income tax take into account current tax laws, our
interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of
current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax
authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax
laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could
significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in
our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of
Income. We must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax
assets will be realized from future taxable income and, based on
this assessment, establish a valuation allowance, if required.
Our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a
number of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including
forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and the relative
proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various
domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. To
the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the
valuation allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a
corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our
Consolidated Statements of Income.

We failed to timely file the final pre-acquisition tax return
for Veritas, and as a result, it is uncertain whether we can
claim a lower tax rate on a dividend made from a Veritas foreign
subsidiary under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. We are
currently petitioning the IRS for relief to allow us to claim
the lower rate of tax. Because we were unable to obtain this
relief prior to filing the Veritas tax return in May 2006, we
have paid $130 million of additional U.S. taxes. The
potential outcomes with respect to our payment of this amount
include:

•

If we ultimately obtain relief from the IRS on this matter, the
    $130 million that we paid in May will be refunded to us and
    we will use that amount to reestablish our income tax accrual
    for the Veritas transfer pricing disputes.

•

If we ultimately do not receive relief from the IRS on this
    matter, and we otherwise have an adjustment arising from the
    Veritas transfer pricing disputes, then we would only owe
    additional tax with regard to such disputes to the extent that
    such adjustment is in excess of $130 million.

•

If we ultimately do not receive relief from the IRS on this
    matter, and we otherwise do not have an adjustment arising from
    the Veritas transfer pricing disputes, then (1) we would be
    required to adjust the purchase price of Veritas to reflect a
    reduction in the amount of pre-acquisition tax liabilities
    assumed; and (2) we would be required to recognize an equal
    amount of income tax expense, up to $130 million.

Legal Contingencies

From time to time, we are involved in disputes that arise in the
ordinary course of business, and we do not expect this trend to
change in the future. We are currently involved in legal
proceedings as discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as other legal
matters.

When the likelihood of the incurrence of costs related to our
legal proceedings is probable and management has the ability to
estimate such costs, we provide for estimates of external legal
fees and any probable losses through charges to our Consolidated
Statements of Income. These estimates have been based on our
assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet
date and are subject to change based upon new information and
intervening events.

Prior to our acquisition of Veritas, Veritas had been in
discussions with the staff of the SEC regarding the SEC’s
review of certain matters, as described in Note 14 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and based on
communications with the staff, Veritas expected these
discussions to result in a settlement with the SEC in which we
would be required to pay a $30 million penalty. As part of
our accounting for the



acquisition of Veritas, we recorded an accrual related to this
matter of $30 million which is included in Other accrued
expenses in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31,
2006. In addition, we are involved in other pending legal
matters, for which our accrual for legal contingencies
represented insignificant amounts related to external legal
fees. However, even if we are successful in our pending legal
matters, estimated costs for external legal fees could be more
than anticipated. In addition, if we are unsuccessful, we could
be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees for
which we have not accrued any amounts for loss contingencies, or
to modify our business practices. Any such results could
materially harm our business and could result in a material
adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations,
or cash flows.

Net revenues increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005
due primarily to sales of products acquired through the Veritas
acquisition, which contributed $1.4 billion of net revenues
in fiscal 2006. In addition, revenues from our enterprise
security products increased $122 million and revenues from
our consumer products increased $73 million in fiscal 2006
compared to fiscal 2005. The increased revenues from these
products were due primarily to continuing growth in demand for
our enterprise virus protection and anti-spam solutions as well
as our consumer security protection products, as described
further in the segment discussions that follow. Beginning in the
December 2005 quarter, as a result of increases in future
subscription pricing for our 2006 consumer products that include
content updates, revenue for these products is recognized on a
ratable basis over the term of the subscription.

Net revenues increased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004
due primarily to increases of $443 million and
$195 million in revenue from our consumer and enterprise
security products, respectively. The increased revenue from
these products was due primarily to continuing growth in demand
for our consumer security protection products and our enterprise
virus protection products. We believe that a significant portion
of the growth in demand was attributable to the continued
increase in vulnerabilities, Internet attacks, and malicious
code activity coupled with a growing level of awareness of these
threats around the world.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue includes
arrangements for software maintenance and technical support for
our products, content and subscription services primarily
related to our security products, revenue from arrangements
where VSOE of the fair value of undelivered elements does not
exist, and managed security services. These arrangements are
generally offered to our customers over a specified period of
time and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the
maintenance, subscription, or service period. Beginning with the
release of our 2006 consumer products that include content
updates in the December 2005



quarter, we recognize revenue related to these products ratably.
As a result, this revenue has been classified as Content,
subscriptions, and maintenance beginning in the December 2005
quarter.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue also includes
professional services revenue, which consists primarily of the
fees we earn related to consulting and educational services. We
generally recognize revenue from our professional services as
the services are performed or upon written acceptance from
customers, if applicable, assuming all other conditions for
revenue recognition have been met.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue increased in
fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to sales of
products acquired through the Veritas acquisition, which
contributed $534 million of Content, subscriptions, and
maintenance revenue in fiscal 2006. In addition, in fiscal 2006,
Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue related to our
consumer security products increased $233 million as
compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to the classification of
$160 million of consumer revenue as Content, subscriptions,
and maintenance (rather than Licenses) in fiscal 2006. Revenue
related to our enterprise security products increased
$133 million, primarily due to increased awareness of
information security threats.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue increased in
fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to
increases of $494 million and $224 million in revenue
from our consumer and enterprise security products,
respectively. The increased sales of these products were due
primarily due to increased awareness of information security
threats and continuing growth in demand for our consumer
security protection products and our enterprise virus protection
solutions.

Licenses revenue increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal
2005 due primarily to sales of products acquired through the
Veritas acquisition, which contributed $835 million of
licenses revenue in fiscal 2006. Our 2006 consumer products that
include content updates were released in the December 2005
quarter, and we recognize revenue related to these products
ratably as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues,
which resulted in a decrease in Licenses revenue of
$160 million in fiscal 2006. Competitive pressures, a lack
of recent high profile information security threat activity, and
to a lesser extent, a decrease in licensing of our enterprise
security products, also partially offset the overall increase in
Licenses revenue.

Licenses revenue decreased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal
2004 due primarily to a $51 million decrease in consumer
products revenue. In fiscal 2005, our consumer products had a
higher subscription component than in fiscal 2004, resulting in
more revenue being classified as Content, subscriptions, and
maintenance in fiscal 2005.

The increase in Consumer Products revenues in fiscal 2006 was
due primarily to an increase of $156 million in revenue
from our Norton Internet Security products as compared to fiscal
2005. The majority of the increase in revenue was booked through
our electronic distribution channel that includes original
equipment manufacturer, or OEM, subscriptions, upgrades, online
sales, and renewals. This increase was partially offset by the
change in our consumer product revenue recognition model for our
2006 consumer products that include content updates. Beginning
in the December 2005 quarter, as a result of increases in future
subscription pricing for our 2006 consumer products that include
content updates, revenue for these products is recognized
ratably over the term of the subscription upon sell through to
end users. This change in our product revenue recognition model
resulted in a 7% reduction in Consumer Products revenues for
fiscal 2006. In addition, revenue from our Norton AntiVirus
products decreased $67 million as our customers continue to
migrate to the Norton Internet Security products, which offer
broader protection to address the rapidly changing threat
environment. Revenue from our electronic distribution channel
(which includes sales of our Norton Internet Security products
and our Norton AntiVirus products) grew by $168 million in
fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. We believe that, in
addition to the factors noted above, the lower growth rate in
our Consumer Products segment was attributable to a changing
threat environment and a strengthening U.S. dollar. In addition,
during fiscal 2006, pricing for subscriptions increased, while
pricing in retail and online stores remained consistent or
decreased.

We believe that a significant portion of the increase in
Consumer Products revenues in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal
2004, was attributable to the continued increase in
vulnerabilities, Internet attacks, and malicious code activity
coupled with a growing level of awareness of these threats
around the world. Specifically, the increase in our Consumer
Products revenues in fiscal 2005 was due primarily to an
increase of $231 million in revenue from our Norton
Internet Security products and an increase of $185 million
in revenue from our Norton AntiVirus products. Revenue from our
electronic distribution channel grew by $297 million in
fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004.

The increase in our Enterprise Security revenue in fiscal 2006
was due to increased growth from our anti-spam products and
lower but continued growth from our Enterprise AntiVirus
products. Specifically, the increase in our Enterprise Security
revenue was due primarily to an increase of $57 million in
revenue from our Enterprise AntiVirus products, and an increase
of $55 million in revenue from our antispam products during
fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005.

Revenue from our Enterprise Security segment increased in fiscal
2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to an increase of
$148 million in revenue from our Enterprise AntiVirus
products. In addition, revenue increased due to sales of
antispam products formerly associated with Brightmail, which we
acquired in June 2004.

Data Protection segment

The Data Protection segment is comprised of products acquired
through the Veritas acquisition. Fiscal 2006 revenue from this
segment of $744 million was comprised primarily of revenue
related to Backup Exec products and NetBackup products of
$336 million and $333 million, respectively. The
remaining revenue was comprised of revenue related to Enterprise
Vault products.

by the continued decline in sales of our pcAnywhere product,
which we expect to continue to decline in the future.

Revenue from our Storage and Server Management segment increased
in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to
revenue from products formerly associated with PowerQuest of
$52 million and ON Technology of $29 million, both of
which we acquired in the second half of fiscal 2004. These

The increase in revenue from our Services segment in fiscal 2005
as compared to fiscal 2004 was due primarily to an increase of

addition, revenue from our Services segment increased due to our
acquisitions in fiscal 2005 of @stake, Inc. and LIRIC Associates.

Other segment

Our Other segment is comprised of sunset products and products
nearing the end of their life cycle. Revenues from the Other
segment in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 were insignificant.

The increase in net revenues in international regions in fiscal
2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to revenue
from products acquired through the Veritas acquisition, which
contributed $661 million of net revenues in international
regions. Increased sales of our Norton Internet Security
products in our Consumer Products segment and our antivirus and
antispam products in our Enterprise Security segment also
contributed to the increase in net revenue in the international
regions in fiscal 2006, while the change to ratable revenue
recognition with the release of the 2006 consumer products that
include content updates partially offset this increase. Weakness
in most major foreign currencies negatively impacted our
international revenue growth by $48 million in fiscal 2006
as compared to fiscal 2005. We are unable to predict the extent
to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes
in foreign currency exchange rates. If international sales
become a greater portion of our total sales in the future,
changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a
potentially greater impact on our revenues and operating results.

The increase in net revenues in international regions in fiscal
2005 was due to increased revenue from our Norton Internet
Security and Norton AntiVirus products in our Consumer Products
segment and our antivirus products in our Enterprise Security
segment in those regions. We believe this increase in sales is
attributable to increased customer awareness related to security
threats. In addition, strength in major foreign currencies
positively impacted our international revenue growth in fiscal
2005 by $74 million as compared to fiscal 2004. The
strength in foreign currencies in fiscal 2005 was due primarily
to the strength of the Euro.

Cost of revenues consists primarily of amortization of acquired
product rights, fee-based technical support costs, costs of
billable services, payments to OEMs under revenue-sharing
arrangements, manufacturing and direct material costs, and
royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing
agreements.

Gross margin decreased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005
due primarily to increased amortization of acquired product
rights resulting from certain identifiable intangible assets
acquired through the Veritas acquisition. Costs for services and
technical support also increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to
fiscal 2005. These increases were partially offset by ratable
recognition of costs for 2006 consumer products that include
content updates, which are recognized ratably over the term of
the license beginning in the December 2005 quarter. We
anticipate that our net revenues from our Services segment may
grow to comprise a higher percentage of our total net revenues,
which would have a negative impact on our gross margin, as our
services typically have higher cost of revenues than our
software products.

Gross margin remained flat at approximately 82% in fiscal 2005

Cost of licenses consists primarily of royalties paid to third
parties under technology licensing agreements and manufacturing
and direct material costs. Cost of licenses decreased as a
percentage of the related revenue in fiscal 2006 as compared to
fiscal 2005 due primarily to lower costs associated with
products acquired through the Veritas acquisition. The Veritas
acquisition added $13 million of costs, which was offset by
a $17 million decrease in consumer products license costs
as compared to fiscal 2005. These costs and the associated
revenue are reported as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance
beginning with the release of our 2006 consumer products that
include content updates, as we now recognize the revenue and
related costs ratably over the content update period.

Cost of licenses decreased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal
2004 due primarily to a $22 million decrease in consumer
licenses costs as compared to fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005, our
consumer products had a higher subscription component.
Therefore, these costs and the associated revenue are reported
as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance. The decrease in
licenses costs in fiscal 2005 was partially offset by a
$6 million increase in cost related to our storage
management products.

The increased amortization in fiscal 2006 is primarily
associated with the Veritas acquisition, for which amortization
began in July 2005. In connection with the Veritas acquisition,
we recorded $1.3 billion in acquired product rights which
are being amortized over their expected useful lives of three
months to five years. We amortize the fair value of all other
acquired product rights over their expected useful lives,
generally one to eight years. For further discussion of acquired
product rights and related amortization, see Notes 3 and 4
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The increased amortization in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal
2004, is primarily associated with the Brightmail acquisition in
June 2004 and the PowerQuest acquisition in December 2003. This
increase was partially offset by certain acquired product rights
becoming fully amortized in fiscal 2005.

In connection with the acquisition of Veritas in July 2005, we
assumed Veritas stock options and RSUs and converted them into
options to purchase 66 million shares of Symantec
common stock and 425,000 Symantec RSUs. The fair value of the
assumed stock options was $688 million using the
Black-Scholes valuation model with the following weighted
average assumptions: volatility of 36%, risk-free interest rate
of 3.4%, expected life of 3.5 years, and dividend yield of
zero. The fair value of the RSUs was $11 million based on
fair value of the underlying shares on the announcement date.
The intrinsic value of the unvested options and RSUs was valued
at $63 million and was recorded in Deferred stock-based
compensation within Stockholders’ equity in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets in the September 2005 quarter. We
recorded amortization of Deferred stock-based compensation
related to the assumed Veritas stock options and RSUs of
$27 million in fiscal 2006.



In connection with the acquisition of Brightmail in June 2004,
we assumed Brightmail stock options and converted them into
options to purchase Symantec common stock. The intrinsic value
of the assumed unvested stock options was $21 million and
was recorded in Deferred stock-based compensation within
Stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
during fiscal 2005. During the September 2004 quarter, we
reduced Deferred stock-based compensation by an insignificant
amount as a result of the cancellation of a portion of those
options upon employee terminations. We recorded amortization of
deferred stock-based compensation related to the assumed
Brightmail stock options of $8 million in fiscal 2006 and
$3 million in fiscal 2005.

On October 20, 2004, we issued 200,000 restricted shares of
common stock to our then-current Chief Financial Officer, at a
purchase price of $1,000 (representing the aggregate par value
at the time of issuance), vesting 50% at each anniversary date.
The market value of the common stock on the date of grant, less
the purchase price, was $6 million and was recorded in
Deferred stock-based compensation within Stockholders’
equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in fiscal 2005. Upon
the retirement of our former Chief Financial Officer in December
2005, 100,000 shares were forfeited and we reversed the
related Deferred stock-based compensation. We recorded
amortization of deferred stock-based compensation related to the
restricted shares of $2 million in fiscal 2006 and
$1 million in fiscal 2005.

During fiscal 2006, we wrote off IPR&D totaling
$285 million, of which $284 million was in connection
with our acquisition of Veritas. The IPR&D was written off
because the acquired technologies had not reached technological
feasibility and had no alternative uses. Technological
feasibility is defined as being equivalent to completion of a
beta-phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk
relating to the development. At the time of the acquisition in
July 2005, Veritas was developing new products in multiple
product areas that qualify as IPR&D. These efforts included
NetBackup 6.1, Backup Exec 11.0, Server Management 5.0, and
various other projects. At the time of the acquisition, it was
estimated that these IPR&D development efforts would be
completed over the following 12 to 18 months at an
estimated total cost of $120 million. At March 31,
2006, the development efforts were continuing on schedule and
within expected costs.

The value assigned to the Veritas IPR&D was determined by
estimating costs to develop the purchased IPR&D into
commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash
flows from the projects when completed, and discounting the net
cash flows to their present values. The revenue estimates used
in the net cash flow forecasts were based on estimates of
relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in
technology, and the nature and expected timing of new product
introductions by Veritas and its competitors.

The rate utilized to discount the net cash flows to their
present values was based on Veritas’ weighted average cost
of capital. The weighted average cost of capital was adjusted to
reflect the difficulties and uncertainties in completing each
project and thereby achieving technological feasibility, the
percentage of completion of each project, anticipated market
acceptance and penetration, market growth rates, and risks
related to the impact of potential changes in future target
markets. Based on these factors, a discount rate of 13.5% was
deemed appropriate for valuing the IPR&D.

The estimates used in valuing IPR&D were based upon
assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently
uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or
inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur.

In fiscal 2005, we wrote off $3 million of IPR&D in
connection with our acquisition of Brightmail. The Brightmail
IPR&D related to the third generation of Brightmail’s
antispam product offering. The efforts required to develop the
acquired IPR&D principally related to the completion of all
planning, design,



development, and testing activities that were necessary to
establish that the product could be produced to meet its design
specifications, including features, functions, and performance.
We determined the fair value of the acquired IPR&D by
estimating the projected cash flows related to the projects and
future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the
products. We discounted the resulting net cash flows to their
present values. We based the net cash flows from such projects
on our analysis of the respective markets and estimates of
revenues and operating profits related to these projects.

In fiscal 2004, we wrote off $4 million of IPR&D in
connection with our acquisitions of ON Technology, PowerQuest,
and Nexland. The in-process technology acquired in the ON
Technology acquisition consisted primarily of research and
development related to its next generation CCM/

products, which enable organizations and service providers to
manage the full lifecycle of their computing systems over
corporate networks. We are using this technology in order to
construct a common platform for our Storage and Server
Management segment products. The in-process technology acquired
in the PowerQuest acquisition consisted primarily of research
and development related to its Virtual Volume Imaging
technology, which provides the capability to recover from server
or desktop failures and minimize system downtime. We have
integrated this technology into our Storage and Server
Management segment product offerings. The in-process technology
acquired in the Nexland acquisition consisted primarily of
research and development related to a next generation firewall
product. We integrated this technology into our firewall and
appliance series of products within our Enterprise Security
segment.

The efforts required to develop the ON Technology, PowerQuest,
and Nexland acquired in-process technology principally related
to the completion of all planning, design, development, and test
activities that were necessary to establish that the product or
service can be produced to meet its design specifications
including features, functions, and performance. We determined
the fair value of the acquired in-process technology by
estimating the projected cash flows related to these projects
and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the
products. We discounted the resulting net cash flows to their
present values. We based the net cash flows from such projects
on our analysis of the respective markets and estimates of
revenues and operating profits related to these projects.

$


As of March 31, 2006, we had a restructuring reserve of
$30 million, of which $20 million was included in
Other accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
$10 million was included in Other long-term liabilities in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The restructuring reserve
consists of $9 million related to a restructuring reserve
assumed from Veritas in connection with the acquisition,
$21 million related to restructuring reserves established
in fiscal 2006, and an insignificant amount related to our
fiscal 2002 restructuring plan. Restructuring reserves
established in fiscal 2006 include $9 million related to
our 2006 restructuring plan, $3 million related to
restructuring costs as a result of the Veritas acquisition, and
$9 million related to restructuring costs as a result of
our other acquisitions.

Restructuring expense

In fiscal 2006, we recorded $25 million of restructuring
costs, of which $18 million related to severance,
associated benefits, and outplacement services and
$7 million related to excess facilities. These
restructuring costs reflect the termination of 446 redundant
employees located in the United States, Europe, and Asia Pacific
and the consolidation of certain facilities in Europe and Asia
Pacific. In fiscal 2006, we paid $16 million related to
this restructuring reserve. We expect the remainder of the costs
to be paid by the end of fiscal 2018.

In fiscal 2005, we recorded $3 million of restructuring
charges, of which $2 million was for costs of severance,
related benefits, and outplacement services related to the
termination of 51 employees located in



the U.S. and Europe due to the consolidation and relocation of
engineering and development functions. In addition we recorded
an increase to the accrual relating to the fiscal 2002
restructuring plan of $1 million due to the termination of
a sublease agreement for facilities in Eugene, Oregon.
Substantially all of the costs had been paid by March 31,
2005.

In fiscal 2004, we recorded $1 million of restructuring
charges for costs of severance, related benefits, and
outplacement services for a member of our senior management
team, as well as an increase to the accrual for excess
facilities in Eugene, Oregon in connection with our fiscal 2002
restructuring plan. Substantially all of the costs had been paid
by March 31, 2005.

The fiscal 2002 restructuring reserve consisted of the costs of
excess facilities in Europe and Eugene, Oregon, net of sublease
income. In fiscal 2006, we paid $2 million upon termination
of the remaining leases. Substantially all of the costs had been
paid by March 31, 2006.

Amounts related to restructuring expense are included in
Restructuring in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Acquisition-related restructuring

In connection with the Veritas acquisition on July 2, 2005,
we assumed a restructuring reserve of $53 million related
to the 2002 Veritas facilities restructuring plan. From the date
of the acquisition through March 31, 2006, we paid
$25 million related to this reserve. Also during this
period, we reduced this reserve by $19 million as we
returned some facilities to use and negotiated early lease
terminations on others for amounts less than originally accrued.
The remaining reserve amount of $9 million will be paid
over the remaining lease terms, ending at various dates through
2022. The majority of the costs are currently scheduled to be
paid by the end of fiscal 2011.

With regard to the 2002 Veritas facilities restructuring plan,
our actual costs have varied and could continue to vary
significantly from our current estimates, depending, in part, on
the commercial real estate market in the applicable metropolitan
areas, our ability to obtain subleases related to these
facilities and the time period to do so, the sublease rental
market rates, and the outcome of negotiations with lessors
regarding terminations of some of the leases. Some of these
factors are beyond our control. Adjustments to the 2002 Veritas
facilities restructuring plan will be made if actual lease exit
costs or sublease income differ materially from amounts
currently expected.

In connection with the Veritas acquisition on July 2, 2005,
we recorded $7 million of restructuring costs, of which
$2 million related to excess facilities costs and
$5 million related to severance, associated benefits, and
outplacement services. These restructuring costs reflect the
termination of redundant employees and the consolidation of
certain facilities as a result of the Veritas acquisition. In
fiscal 2006, we paid $4 million related to this reserve. We
expect the remainder of the costs to be paid by the end of
fiscal 2012.

For information on the acquisition related costs incurred in
connection with the Veritas acquisition, see Note 3 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In connection with our other acquisitions in fiscal 2006, we
recorded $12 million of restructuring costs, of which
$8 million related to severance, associated benefits, and
outplacement services and $4 million related to excess
facilities costs. These restructuring costs reflect the
termination of redundant employees and the consolidation of
certain facilities as a result of our other acquisitions. In
fiscal 2006, we paid $3 million in connection with this
reserve. We expect the remainder of the costs to be paid by the
end of fiscal 2012.

Amounts related to acquisition-related restructuring are
reflected in the purchase price allocation of the applicable
acquisition.

Integration planning

In connection with our acquisition of Veritas, we recorded
integration planning costs of $16 million in fiscal 2006
and $3 million in fiscal 2005, which consisted primarily of
costs incurred for consulting services and other professional
fees.



Patent settlement

On May 12, 2005, we resolved patent litigation matters with
Altiris, Inc. by entering into a cross-licensing agreement that
resolved all legal claims between the companies. As part of the
settlement, we paid Altiris $10 million for use of the
disputed technology. Under the transaction, we expensed
$2 million of patent settlement costs in the June 2005
quarter that was related to benefits received in and prior to
the June 2005 quarter. The remaining $8 million was
recorded as Acquired product rights in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets and is being amortized to Cost of revenues in the
Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining life of the
primary patent, which expires in May 2017.

On August 6, 2003, we purchased a security technology
patent as part of a settlement in

Hilgraeve, Inc. v.
Symantec Corporation.

As part of the settlement, we also
received licenses to the remaining patents in Hilgraeve’s
portfolio. The total cost of purchasing the patent and licensing
additional patents was $63 million, which was paid in cash
in August 2003. Under the transaction, we recorded
$14 million of patent settlement costs in the June 2003
quarter that was related to benefits received by us in and prior
to the June 2003 quarter. The remaining $49 million was
recorded as Acquired product rights in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets and is being amortized to Cost of revenues in the
Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining life of the
primary patent, which expires in June 2011.

The increase in Interest and other income, net in fiscal 2006 as
compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to a higher average
investment balance, due to the cash acquired through the Veritas
acquisition, and higher average interest rates. The increase in
Interest and other income, net in fiscal 2005 as compared to
fiscal 2004 was due to a higher average investment balance and
higher average interest rates.

Interest expense in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to the
interest and accretion related to the 0.25% convertible
subordinated notes that were assumed in connection with the
acquisition of Veritas. In August 2003, Veritas issued
$520 million of 0.25% convertible subordinated notes
due August 1, 2013. For further discussion of the
0.25% convertible subordinated notes, see Note 6 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest expense in fiscal 2005 and 2004 was primarily related
to our $600 million 3% convertible subordinated notes
issued in October 2001. In November 2004, substantially all of
the outstanding convertible subordinated notes were converted
into 70.3 million shares of our common stock and the
remainder was redeemed for cash.

Income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product
lines during fiscal 2004 primarily related to royalty payments
received in connection with the licensing of substantially all
of the ACT! product line technology. In December 2003, Interact
Commerce Corporation purchased this technology from us.

Our effective tax rate on income before taxes was approximately
57%, 38%, and 32% in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
The effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 reflects the impact of
the IPR&D charges and other acquisition-related charges that
are nondeductible for tax reporting purposes, partially offset
by foreign earnings taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. tax
rate, and the effect of the

true-up

of taxes on
repatriated earnings. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2005
reflects the additional tax expense attributable to the
$500 million of foreign earnings that we repatriated under
the American Jobs Creation Act.

We believe realization of substantially all of our deferred tax
assets as of March 31, 2006 of $467 million, after
application of the valuation allowance, is more likely than not
based on the future reversal of temporary tax differences.
Realization of approximately $27 million of our deferred
tax assets as of March 31, 2006 is dependent upon future
taxable earnings exclusive of reversing temporary differences in
certain foreign jurisdictions. Levels of future taxable income
are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in
Item 1A,

Risk Factors

, set forth in this annual
report. An additional valuation allowance against net deferred
tax assets may be necessary if it is more likely than not that
all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be
realized. We will assess the need for an additional valuation
allowance on a quarterly basis. The valuation allowance on our
deferred tax assets increased by $59 million in fiscal
2006, of which approximately $58 million is attributable to
acquisition-related assets, the benefit of which will reduce
goodwill when and if realized. The valuation allowance on our
deferred tax assets increased by an immaterial amount in fiscal
2005.

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 —
    Repatriation of foreign earnings

In the March 2005 quarter, we repatriated $500 million from
certain of our foreign subsidiaries that qualified for the 85%
dividends received deduction under the provisions of the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the Jobs Act, enacted in
October 2004. We recorded a tax charge for this repatriation of
$54 million in the March 2005 quarter.

In May 2005, clarifying language was issued by the
U.S. Department of Treasury and the IRS with respect to the
treatment of foreign taxes paid on the earnings repatriated
under the Jobs Act and in September 2005, additional clarifying
language was issued regarding the treatment of certain
deductions attributable to the earnings repatriation. As a
result of this clarifying language, we reduced the tax expense
attributable to the repatriation by approximately
$21 million in fiscal 2006, which reduced the cumulative
tax charge on the repatriation to $33 million.

The $500 million repatriation under the Jobs Act was deemed
to be distributed entirely from foreign earnings that had been
previously treated as indefinitely reinvested. However, this
distribution from previously indefinitely reinvested earnings
does not change our position going forward that future earnings
of certain of our foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely
reinvested.

Other tax matters

On March 29, 2006, we received a Notice of Deficiency from
the IRS claiming that we owe additional taxes, plus interest and
penalties, for the 2000 and 2001 tax years based on an audit of
Veritas, which we acquired in July 2005. The incremental tax
liability asserted by the IRS with regard to the Veritas claim
is $867 million, excluding penalties and interest. The
Notice of Deficiency primarily relates to transfer pricing in
connection with a technology license agreement between Veritas
and a foreign subsidiary. We do not agree



with the IRS position and we intend to file a timely petition to
the Tax Court to protest the assessment. No payments will be
made on the assessment until the issue is definitively resolved.
If, upon resolution, we are required to pay an amount in excess
of our provision for this matter, the incremental amounts due
would be accounted for principally as additions to the Veritas
purchase price as an increase to goodwill. Any incremental
interest accrued subsequent to the date of the Veritas
acquisition would be recorded as an expense in the period the
matter is resolved.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we made $90 million
of tax-related adjustments to the purchase accounting for
Veritas, consisting of $120 million of additional

pre-acquisition

tax
reserve-related adjustments, partially offset by a
$30 million reduction in other

pre-acquisition

taxes
payable. While we strongly disagree with the IRS over both its
transfer pricing methodologies and the amount of the assessment,
we have established additional tax reserves for all Veritas
pre-acquisition years to account for both contingent tax and
interest risk.

On March 30, 2006, we received notices of proposed
adjustment from the IRS with regard to an unrelated audit of
Symantec for fiscal years 2003 and 2004. The IRS claimed that we
owed an incremental tax liability with regard to this audit of
$110 million, excluding penalties and interest. The
incremental tax liability primarily relates to transfer pricing
matters between Symantec and a foreign subsidiary. On
June 2, 2006, we reached an agreement in principle with the
IRS to settle the IRS claims relating to this audit for
$36 million, excluding interest. The consolidated financial
statements presented in this annual report reflect adequate
accruals to address this settlement amount. We anticipate that
we will finalize this settlement with the IRS before the end of
June 2006.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we increased our tax
reserves by an additional $64 million in connection with
all open Symantec tax years (fiscal 2003 to 2006). Since these
reserves relate to licensing arising from acquired technology,
the additional accruals are primarily offset by deferred taxes.

We are as yet unable to confirm our eligibility to claim a lower
tax rate on a distribution made from a Veritas foreign
subsidiary prior to the acquisition. The distribution was
intended to be made pursuant to the Jobs Act, and therefore
eligible for a 5.25% effective U.S. federal rate of tax, in
lieu of the 35% statutory rate. We are seeking a ruling from the
IRS on the matter. Because we were unable to obtain this ruling
prior to filing the Veritas tax return in May 2006, we have paid
$130 million of additional U.S. taxes. Since this
payment relates to the taxability of foreign earnings that are
otherwise the subject of the IRS assessment, this additional
payment reduced the amount of taxes payable accrued as part of
the purchase accounting for pre-acquisition contingent tax
risks. For further information, see Note 13 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements and

As of March 31, 2006, our principal source of liquidity was
our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments
of $2.9 billion, of which 28% was held domestically and the
remainder was held outside of the U.S. The remittance back to
the U.S. of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments
held by legal entities domiciled outside of the U.S. may result
in significant additional income tax expense. Accordingly, we
may choose to enhance our domestic cash position through
third-party financing arrangements. We recently



completed the reorganization of certain international
subsidiaries acquired as part of the Veritas acquisition. This
reorganization is expected to result in a rebalancing of our
cash between the U.S. and foreign operations over the next
several years.

On July 2, 2005, we completed our acquisition of Veritas
and acquired its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments of approximately $2.9 billion and assumed
contingently convertible debt with a principal amount of
$520 million due August 1, 2013 and a short-term loan
with a principal amount of EURO 411 million, which was
paid in its entirety on July 7, 2005. The convertible debt
may be converted by the holders at any time into
24.37288 shares of Symantec common stock per $1,000
principal amount, which is equivalent to a conversion price of
approximately $41.03 per share of Symantec common stock.
Upon conversion, we would be required to pay the holder the cash
value of the applicable number of shares of Symantec common
stock ($16.83 per share at March 31, 2006), up to the
principal amount of the note. Amounts in excess of the principal
amount, if any, may be paid in cash or in stock at
Symantec’s option. Interest payments of 0.25% per
annum on the principal amount are payable semi-annually in
arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year. On or
after August 5, 2006, we have the option to redeem all or a
portion of the notes at a redemption price equal to the
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On
August 1, 2006 and August 1, 2008, or upon a
fundamental change involving Symantec, holders have the right to
require us to repurchase the notes at a repurchase price equal
to the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The
notes are classified as a current liability in our Consolidated
Balance Sheets at March 31, 2006.

During fiscal 2006, in addition to Veritas, we completed
acquisitions of five privately-held companies and one public
company for $627 million in cash, including
acquisition-related expenses resulting from financial advisory,
legal and accounting services, duplicate sites, and severance
costs.

During April 2006, we purchased an office building of
approximately 236,000 square feet in Cupertino, California
for $81 million. This property is currently leased to a
third party.

We believe that our cash balances, including those assumed in
the acquisition of Veritas, as well as cash that we generate
over time from our combined operations and our borrowing
capacity, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash
needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least
the next 12 months.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2006
resulted largely from net income of $157 million, plus an
increase in deferred revenue of $683 million, non-cash
charges, primarily for depreciation and amortization, of
$678 million, and the write off of IPR&D of
$285 million related to the acquisitions of Veritas and
BindView. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in
deferred income taxes of $203 million and by an increase in
trade accounts receivable of $87 million. We expect
operating cash flow to continue to be positive in the future.

Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2005
resulted largely from net income of $536 million, plus
non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of
$132 million, the income tax benefit from employee stock
plans of $109 million, and deferred income taxes of
$61 million. In addition, our deferred revenue increased by
$319 million and income taxes payable increased by
$56 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2004
resulted largely from net income of $371 million, plus
non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of
$117 million and the income tax benefit from employee stock
plans of $67 million. Deferred revenue increased by
$345 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts
receivable of $83 million. In addition, income taxes
payable increased by $54 million.

Investing Activities

Net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2006 was
primarily the result of net sales of available-for-sale
securities of $3.4 billion and cash of $541 million
acquired through the acquisition of Veritas, net of cash
expenditures for our other acquisitions in fiscal 2006. These
amounts were partially offset by capital expenditures of
$267 million, including $63 million for the purchase
of two buildings in Mountain View, California.



Net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2005 was
primarily the result of payments for business acquisitions of
$424 million and net purchases of available-for-sale
securities of $143 million.

Net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2004 was
primarily the result of net purchases of available-for-sale
securities of $332 million, payments for business
acquisitions of $287 million, and capital expenditures of
$111 million.

We expect to continue our investing activities, including
investments in available-for-sale securities. Furthermore, cash
reserves may be used for strategic acquisitions of software
companies or technologies that are complementary to our business.

Financing Activities

We have operated a stock repurchase program since 2001. On
March 28, 2005, the Board of Directors increased the dollar
amount of authorized stock repurchases by $3 billion, which
became effective upon completion of the Veritas acquisition on
July 2, 2005. We commenced repurchases under the
$3 billion authorization on August 2, 2005 and as of
December 31, 2005 all authorized repurchases, including
$474 million from prior authorizations, were completed.

On January 31, 2006, the Board, through one of its
committees, authorized the repurchase of $1 billion of
Symantec common stock, without a scheduled expiration date. In
connection with this stock repurchase authorization, we entered
into Rule

10b5-1

trading plans intended to facilitate stock repurchases of
$125 million per quarter during fiscal 2007. We used
$154 million of the authorized amount to repurchase shares
in the open market in the March 2006 quarter and we intend to
use the remaining amount to make stock repurchases under
Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and opportunistically in fiscal
2007.

In fiscal 2006, we repurchased 174 million shares at prices
ranging from $15.83 to $23.85 per share for an aggregate
amount of $3.6 billion. In fiscal 2005, we repurchased
eight million shares at prices ranging from $21.05 to
$30.77 per share for an aggregate amount of
$192 million. In fiscal 2004, we repurchased
three million shares at prices ranging from $19.52 to
$20.82 per share for an aggregate amount of
$60 million. As of March 31, 2006, $846 million
remained authorized for future repurchases. For further
information regarding stock repurchases, see Item 5,

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related
Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

of this annual report.

In fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, we received net proceeds of
$210 million, $160 million, and $189 million,
respectively, from the sale of our common stock through employee
benefit plans.

In fiscal 2006, we repaid the entire balance of a short-term
loan with a principal amount of EURO 411 million that
we assumed in connection with our acquisition of Veritas.

Contractual Obligations

The contractual obligations presented in the table below
represent our estimates of future payments under fixed
contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business
needs, cancellation provisions, interest rates, and other
factors may result in actual payments differing from these

    100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
    On August 1, 2006 and August 1, 2008, or upon the
    occurrence of a fundamental change involving Symantec, holders
    of the 0.25% Notes may require Symantec to repurchase their
    notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount,
    plus accrued and unpaid interest.


Represents amounts associated with agreements that are
    enforceable, legally binding, and specify terms.


Includes $22 million related to facilities included in our
    restructuring reserve.

Development agreements

In the June 2005 quarter, we entered into agreements in
connection with the construction of, or refurbishments to,
buildings in Springfield, Oregon and Culver City, California.
Payment is contingent upon the achievement of certain
agreed-upon milestones. The remaining commitment is
$147 million as of March 31, 2006 which mainly relates
to the construction of the Culver City, California facility.

Royalties

We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment
and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally
based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of
underlying revenue and has not been included in the table above.
Certain royalty commitments have minimum commitment obligations;
however, as of March 31, 2006, all such obligations are
immaterial.

Indemnification

As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we
indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or
occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at
our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of
future payments we could be required to make under these
indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have
director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our
exposure and enables us to recover a portion or all of any
future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of
these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable
insurance coverage is minimal.

, and SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities.

SFAS No. 155
simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in
other financial instruments by allowing them to be accounted for
as a whole if the holder elects to account for the entire
instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS No. 155 also
clarifies and amends certain other provisions of
SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140.
SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial
instruments acquired, issued or subject to a remeasurement event
occurring in fiscal years beginning



after September 15, 2006. Earlier adoption is permitted,
provided the company has not yet issued financial statements,
including for interim periods, for that fiscal year. We do not
expect the adoption of SFAS No. 155 to have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows.

In June 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position, or FSP,
FAS

143-1,

Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations

,
which provides guidance on the accounting for certain
obligations associated with the Directive on Waste Electrical
and Electronic Equipment, or the Directive, which was adopted by
the European Union, or the EU. Under the Directive, the waste
management obligation for historical equipment, defined as
products put on the market on or prior to August 13, 2005,
remains with the commercial user until the equipment is
replaced. FSP
FAS

143-1

is
required to be applied to the later of the first fiscal period
ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the
Directive’s adoption into law by the applicable EU member
countries in which we have significant operations. We are
currently evaluating the impact of FSP
FAS

143-1

on our
financial position and results of operations. The effects will
depend on the respective laws adopted by the EU member countries.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

, which replaces
APB No. 20,

Accounting Changes

, and
SFAS No. 3,

Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial Statements — An Amendment of APB Opinion
No. 28.

SFAS No. 154 provides guidance on
accounting for and reporting changes in accounting principle and
error corrections. SFAS No. 154 requires that changes
in accounting principle be applied retrospectively to prior
period financial statements and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2005. When adopted and if
used, SFAS No. 154 would have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, which requires companies to measure
and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payments
at fair value. SFAS No. 123R is effective for annual
periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and, thus, will be
effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal
2007. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123R is
similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123.
However, SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, to be
recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income based on
their fair values. Pro forma disclosure of fair value
recognition will no longer be an alternative. See

Stock-Based
Compensation

in

Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

for information related to the pro forma effects on
our reported net income and net income per share when applying
the fair value recognition provisions of the previous
SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation. On
April 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R using the
modified prospective method. We expect the adoption of
SFAS No. 123R to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets — An Amendment of
APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions.

SFAS No. 153 eliminates the
exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges
of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB
Opinion No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions

, and replaces it with an exception for
exchanges that do not have commercial substance.
SFAS No. 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has
commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are
expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange.
SFAS No. 153 is effective for fiscal periods beginning
after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 153
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flow.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 109-1,

Application of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting
for Income Taxes,” to the Tax Deduction on Qualified
Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004.

The American Jobs Creation Act introduces a special
tax deduction on qualified production activities. FSP
FAS 109-1 clarifies that this tax deduction should be
accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with
SFAS No. 109. FSP FAS 109-1 did not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial position, results
of operations, or cash flows.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
    Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in market
prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates. We
use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these
risks. All financial instruments used are in accordance with our
global investment policy and global foreign exchange policy. We
do not use derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes. We do not anticipate any material changes in our
primary market risk exposures in fiscal 2007.

We also hold equity interests in several privately-held
companies. These investments were recorded at cost, and are
classified as Other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. These investments are inherently risky and we could lose
our entire investment in these companies. As of March 31,
2006, these investments had an aggregate carrying value of
$11 million.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

We consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased
with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash
equivalents. All of our cash equivalents and short-term
investments are classified as available-for-sale securities as
of the balance sheet dates. Our available-for-sale securities
are reported at fair market value and any unrealized gains and
losses are included as a component of Stockholders’ equity
in Accumulated other comprehensive income in our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments
consist primarily of corporate securities, corporate bonds,
asset-backed securities, U.S. government and
government-sponsored securities, and money market funds. The
following table presents the fair value and hypothetical changes
in fair market values of our significant financial instruments,
which primarily consist of commercial paper, corporate debt
securities, and government and government backed securities,
held as of March 31, 2006 that are sensitive to changes in
interest rates (in millions):

The modeling technique used above measures the change in fair
market value arising from selected potential changes in interest
rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel
shifts in the yield curve of minus 75 basis points, minus
25 basis points, plus 50 basis points, plus
100 basis points, and plus 150 basis points, which are
representative of potential movements in the United States
Federal Funds Rate and the Euro Area ECB Rate.

Exchange Rate Sensitivity

We conduct business in 36 currencies through our worldwide
operations. We believe that the use of foreign exchange forward
contracts should reduce the risks that arise from conducting
business in international markets.

We hedge certain risks associated with certain foreign currency
cash and cash equivalents, investments, receivables, and
payables in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign
currency fluctuations on these assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange forward
contracts as of March 31, 2006 were as follows (in
millions):

Hypothetical Increase (Decrease) in

We believe that these foreign exchange forward contracts do not
subject us to undue risk from the movement of foreign exchange
rates because gains and losses on these contracts are offset by
losses and gains on the underlying assets and liabilities. All
contracts have a maturity of no more than 35 days. Gains
and losses are accounted for as Interest and other income, net
each period. We regularly review our hedging program and may
make changes as a result of this review.

Controls and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have
concluded, based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules

13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) by our management,
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer, that, as a result of the material
weakness described below, such disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of the end of the period
covered by this report.

(b)

Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules

13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) for Symantec. Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2006, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Based on its evaluation, our management has identified a
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting
related to accounting for income taxes as of March 31,
2006. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, as
defined in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing
Standard No. 2, or a combination of significant
deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that
a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim
financial statements would not be prevented or detected by
company personnel in the normal course of performing their
assigned functions.

Management has determined that we had insufficient personnel
resources with adequate expertise to properly manage the
increased volume and complexity of income tax matters associated
with the acquisition of Veritas Software Corporation. This lack
of resources resulted in inadequate levels of supervision and
review related to the our IRS filings and our accounting for
income taxes. This material weakness resulted in our failure to
follow established policies and procedures designed to ensure
timely income tax filings. Specifically, we did not complete the
timely filing of an extension request with the IRS for the final
pre-acquisition income tax return for Veritas and, accordingly,
did not secure certain income tax related elections. In
addition, this material weakness resulted in errors in our
annual accounting for income taxes. These errors in accounting
were corrected prior to the issuance of our 2006 consolidated
financial statements. The aforementioned material weakness
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material
misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements, due
to a failure to complete income tax filings consistent with
management’s intentions, and due to errors in accounting
for income taxes, would not be prevented or detected.

Because of this material weakness, management has concluded
Symantec did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2006, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the COSO.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has
audited management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
Symantec’s internal control over financial reporting and
has issued an audit report thereon, which is included in
Part IV, Item 15 of this annual report.



(c)

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting.

At the end of February 2006, we hired a new Vice President of
Tax and Treasury to help manage the increased complexity of our
income tax matters. During the quarter ended March 31,
2006, there were no other changes in our internal control over
financial reporting that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

Since April 1, 2006, we have implemented additional
controls in our internal control over financial reporting that
serve to remediate the material weakness described above,
including the addition of resources dedicated to financial
reporting for income taxes and the implementation of processes
to identify and calendar all incremental tax compliance and
financial accounting for income tax requirements arising from
acquisitions. In addition, we intend to automate key elements of
our processes to enhance the analysis and calculation of the
income tax provision and the reconciliation of the tax accounts.

(d)

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors
and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of
the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Symantec have been
detected.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Symantec Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
March 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity and
comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended March 31, 2006. In connection with
our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also
have audited the related financial statement schedule listed in
the Index at Item 15(a)2. These consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit also includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries as of
March 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended March 31, 2006, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Symantec Corporation’s internal control
over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
dated June 8, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of, and an adverse opinion on the
effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Symantec Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A(b), that
Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as
of March 31, 2006 because of the effect of a material
weakness identified in management’s assessment based on
criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Symantec
Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in a more than remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weakness related to accounting for income
taxes has been identified and included in management’s
assessment as of March 31, 2006.

The Company had insufficient personnel resources with adequate
expertise to properly manage the increased volume and complexity
of income tax matters associated with the acquisition of Veritas
Software Corporation. This lack of resources resulted in
inadequate levels of supervision and review related to the
Company’s Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filings and the
Company’s accounting for income taxes. This material
weakness resulted in the Company’s failure to follow
established policies and procedures designed to ensure timely
income tax filings. Specifically, the Company did not complete
the timely filing of an extension request with the IRS for the
final pre-acquisition income tax return for Veritas and,
accordingly, did not secure certain income tax related
elections. In addition, this material weakness resulted in
errors in the Company’s annual accounting for income taxes.
The aforementioned material weakness results in more than a
remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the
Company’s annual or interim financial statements due



to a failure to complete income tax filings consistent with
management’s intentions, and due to errors in accounting
for income taxes, would not be prevented or detected.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Symantec Corporation and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and
comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended March 31, 2006. This material
weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and
extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the Company’s
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
March 31, 2006, and this report does not affect our report
dated June 8, 2006, which expressed an unqualified opinion
on those consolidated financial statements.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Symantec
Corporation did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2006, is fairly stated,
in all material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by COSO. Also, in our opinion, because of the material weakness
described above on the achievement of the objectives of the
control criteria, Symantec Corporation has not maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
March 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by COSO.

SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Symantec Corporation (“we,” “us,” and
“our” refer to Symantec Corporation and all of its
subsidiaries) is the world leader in providing a wide range of
solutions to help individuals and enterprises assure the
security, availability, and integrity of their information
technology, or IT, infrastructure as well as the information
itself. With innovative technology solutions and services, we
help individuals and enterprises protect and manage their
digital assets. We provide a wide range of solutions including
enterprise and consumer security, data protection, application
and infrastructure management, security management, storage and
server management, and response and managed security services.
Founded in 1982, we have operations in 40 countries
worldwide.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Symantec Corporation and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

Reclassifications

Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the current presentation. In particular, we have
reclassified certain amounts related to auction-rate securities
for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 from cash
equivalents to short-term investments to comply with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 95,

Statement of Cash Flows.

As a result, our Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended March 31, 2004
reflects an increase of $278 million in Net cash used for
investing activities and corresponding decreases in Increase in
cash and cash equivalents and Ending cash and cash equivalents
when compared to amounts previously reported in our
Form

10-K

for the
year ended March 31, 2004.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

On July 2, 2005, we completed our acquisition of Veritas
Software Corporation, or Veritas, a leading provider of software
and services to enable storage and backup. The results of
operations of Veritas have been included in our results of
operations beginning on July 2, 2005. For pro forma results
of operations of Symantec and Veritas, see Note 3. In
addition, in fiscal 2006, we acquired five privately-held
companies and one public company. In fiscal 2005, we acquired
five privately-held companies and in fiscal 2004, we acquired
two privately-held companies and two public companies. Each of
these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase and,
accordingly, each acquired company’s operating results has
been included in our consolidated financial statements since its
respective date of acquisition.

Fiscal years

We have a

52/53-week

fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references as of and
for the periods ended March 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004
reflect amounts as of and for the periods ended March 31,
2006, April 1, 2005, and April 2, 2004, respectively.
The fiscal accounting years ended March 31, 2006 and
April 1, 2005 are each comprised of 52 weeks of
operations, while the fiscal accounting year ended April 2,
2004 is comprised of 53 weeks of operations. The fiscal
accounting year ending March 30, 2007 will comprise
52 weeks of operations.

Symantec share and per share amounts in the Consolidated
Statements of Income and the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements retroactively reflect the two-for-one stock splits
effected as stock dividends, which occurred on November 30,
2004 and November 19, 2003.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.



Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally
the local currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate on the
balance sheet dates. The translation adjustments resulting from
this process are included as a component of Stockholders’
equity in Accumulated other comprehensive income. Revenues and
expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates
prevailing during the year. Foreign currency transaction gains
and losses are included Interest and other income, net in the
Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred tax assets
(liabilities) are established on the cumulative translation
adjustment attributable to unremitted foreign earnings that are
not intended to be indefinitely reinvested.

Revenue Recognition

We market and distribute our software products both as
stand-alone software products and as integrated product suites.
We recognize revenue when the following conditions have been met:

We derive revenue primarily from sales of content,
subscriptions, and maintenance and licenses.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue includes
arrangements for software maintenance and technical support for
our products, content and subscription services primarily
related to our security products, revenue from arrangements
where vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of the fair
value of undelivered elements does not exist, and managed
security services. These arrangements are generally offered to
our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize
the related revenue ratably over the maintenance, subscription,
or service period.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue also includes
professional services revenue, which consists primarily of the
fees we earn related to consulting and educational services. We
generally recognize revenue from professional services as the
services are performed or upon written acceptance from
customers, if applicable, assuming all other conditions for
revenue recognition noted above have been met.

License revenue is derived primarily from the licensing of our
various products and technology. We generally recognize license
revenue upon delivery of the product, assuming all other
conditions for revenue recognition noted above have been met.

We enter into perpetual software license agreements through
direct sales to customers and indirect sales with distributors
and resellers. The license agreements generally include product
maintenance agreements, for which the related revenue is
included with Content, subscriptions, and maintenance and is
deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the
agreements.

In arrangements that include multiple elements, including
perpetual software licenses and maintenance and/or services and
packaged products with content updates, we allocate and defer
revenue for the undelivered items based on VSOE of fair value of
the undelivered elements, and recognize the difference between
the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the
undelivered items as license revenue. VSOE of each element is
based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold
separately. We determine fair value of the undelivered elements
based on historical evidence of our stand-alone sales of these
elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for
the undelivered elements. When VSOE does not exist for
undelivered items such as maintenance, the entire arrangement
fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Our
deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance
of enterprise product maintenance and consumer product content
update subscriptions.

Indirect channel sales

For our Consumer Products segment, we sell packaged software
products through a multi-tiered distribution channel. We also
sell electronic download and packaged products via the Internet.
We separately



sell annual content update subscriptions directly to end-users
primarily via the Internet. As a result of increases in future
subscription pricing for the 2006 versions of our consumer
products that include content updates, we recognize revenue for
these products ratably over the term of the subscription upon
sell-through to end users. For most other consumer products, we
recognize package product revenue on distributor and reseller
channel inventory that is not in excess of specified inventory
levels in these channels. We offer the right of return of our
products under various policies and programs with our
distributors, resellers, and end-user customers. We estimate and
record reserves for product returns as an offset to revenue. We
fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channel
as an offset to revenue.

For our Enterprise Security, Data Protection, and Storage and
Server Management segments, we generally recognize revenue from
licensing of software products through our indirect sales
channel upon sell-through or with evidence of an end user. For
licensing of our software to original equipment manufacturers,
or OEMs, royalty revenue is recognized when the OEM reports the
sale of the software products to an end-user customer, generally
on a quarterly basis. In addition to license royalties, some
OEMs pay an annual flat fee and/or support royalties for the
right to sell maintenance and technical support to the end user.
We recognize revenue from OEM support royalties and fees ratably
over the term of the support agreement.

We offer channel and end-user rebates for our products. Our
estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are
based on distributors’ and resellers’ actual
performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive
rebate programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our
reserves for end-user rebates are estimated based on the terms
and conditions of the promotional program, actual sales during
the promotion, amount of actual redemptions received, historical
redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program,
and the value of the rebate. We estimate and record reserves for
channel and end-user rebates as an offset to revenue. For 2006
consumer products that include content updates, rebates are
recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the term of the
subscription.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

We classify our cash equivalents and short-term investments in
accordance with SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.

We
consider investments in instruments purchased with an original
maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. We
classify our short-term investments as available-for-sale, and
short-term investments consist of marketable debt or equity
securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days.
Our short-term investments do not include equity investments in
privately held companies. Our short-term investments are
reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of
tax, included in Accumulated other comprehensive income within
Stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments,
realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be
other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are
included in Interest and other income, net in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. We use the specific identification method
to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon
sale of short-term investments.

Trade Accounts Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
and are not interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for
doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible trade
receivables. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts
are recorded as operating expenses. We review our trade
receivables by aging category to identify specific customers
with known disputes or collectibility issues. We exercise
judgment when determining the adequacy of these reserves as we
evaluate historical bad debt trends, general economic conditions
in the U.S. and internationally, and changes in customer
financial conditions. We also offset deferred revenue against
accounts receivable when channel inventories are in excess of
specified levels and for transactions where collection of a
receivable is not considered probable.

Equity Investments

We have equity investments in privately held companies for
business and strategic purposes. These investments are included
in Other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
are accounted for under the cost method as we do not have
significant influence over these investees. Under the cost
method, the



investment is recorded at its initial cost and is periodically
evaluated for impairment. During our review for impairment, we
examine the investees’ actual and forecasted operating
results, financial position, and liquidity, as well as
business/industry factors in assessing whether a decline in
value of an equity investment has occurred that is
other-than-temporary. When such a decline in value is
identified, the fair value of the equity investment is estimated
based on the preceding factors and an impairment loss is
recognized in Interest and other income, net in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. In fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, we
recognized impairment losses on our equity investments of
$4 million, $1 million, and $3 million,
respectively.

Each quarter we assess our compliance with accounting guidance,
including the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No., or FIN, 46R,

Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities — An Interpretation of ARB
No. 51

, and any impairment issues. Under FIN 46R,
we must consolidate a variable interest entity if we have a
variable interest (or combination of variable interests) in the
entity that will absorb a majority of the entity’s expected
losses, receive a majority of the entity’s expected
residual returns, or both. Currently, our equity investments are
not subject to consolidation under FIN 46R as we do not
have significant influence over these investees and we do not
receive a majority of the returns.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We utilize some natural hedging to mitigate our foreign currency
exposures and we manage certain residual exposures through the
use of one-month forward foreign exchange contracts. We enter
into forward foreign exchange contracts with high-quality
financial institutions primarily to minimize currency exchange
risks associated with certain balance sheet positions
denominated in foreign currencies. We do not utilize derivative
instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Gains and
losses on the contracts are included in Interest and other
income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the
period that gains and losses on the underlying maturing forward
transactions are recognized. The gains and losses on the
contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the
underlying transactions. Changes in the fair value of forward
foreign exchange contracts are included in earnings. As of
March 31, 2006, the notional amount of our forward exchange
contracts was $674 million, which approximates fair value
due to their short time to maturity. All of our forward exchange
contracts mature in 35 days or less. We do not hedge our
foreign currency translation risk.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
principally determined using currently adjusted standards, which
approximate actual cost on a

first-in,

first-out
basis. Inventory consists of raw materials and finished goods as
well as deferred costs of revenue. Deferred costs of revenue
were $41 million at March 31, 2006 and
$14 million at March 31, 2005, of which
$29 million and zero, respectively, are related to 2006
consumer products that include content updates and will be
recognized ratably over the term of the subscription.

Property, Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements

Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements are stated at
cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation and amortization is provided on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets
as follows:

Capitalized Software Development Costs

Costs incurred in connection with the development of software
products are accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 86,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software to Be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed.

Development costs incurred in the research and development of
new software products and enhancements to existing software
products are expensed as incurred until technological
feasibility in the form of a working



model has been established. Our software has been available for
general release concurrent with the establishment of
technological feasibility, and accordingly no software
development costs have been capitalized in fiscal 2006, 2005,
and 2004.

Acquired Product Rights

Acquired product rights are comprised of purchased product
rights, technologies, databases and revenue-related order
backlog, and contracts from acquired companies. Acquired product
rights are stated at cost less accumulated amortization.
Amortization of acquired product rights is provided on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
respective assets, generally one to eight years, and is included
in Cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in
accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.

SFAS No. 142 requires that
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives be tested for impairment at least annually, or more
frequently if events and circumstances warrant. We evaluate
goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of
our reporting units, which are the same as our operating
segments, to its carrying value, including the goodwill
allocated to that reporting unit. To determine the reporting
units’ fair values in the current year evaluation, we used
the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of
each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future
cash flows of that unit. Our cash flow assumptions are based on
historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs, and other
relevant factors. SFAS No. 142 also requires that
intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized over
their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for
impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets.

Long-Lived Assets

We account for long-lived assets in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, which requires that long-lived and
intangible assets, including Property and equipment, net,
Acquired product rights, net, and Other intangible assets, net
be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. We would recognize an impairment loss when
the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to
result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is
less than its carrying amount. Such impairment loss would be
measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the
asset and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of would be
separately presented in the Consolidated balance sheets and
reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less
costs to sell, and no longer depreciated. The assets and
liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale
would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and
liability sections of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with
SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes.

The
provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and
liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in each jurisdiction
in which we operate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to
taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets
are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation
allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is
believed more likely than not to be realized. We also account
for any income tax contingencies in accordance with
SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies.

Net Income Per Share

Basic and diluted net income per share are presented in
conformity with SFAS No. 128,

Earnings per
Share

, for all periods presented. Basic net income per share
is computed using the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the periods. Diluted net income per share is
computed using the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding
during the periods. Potentially dilutive common shares include
the assumed exercise of stock options using the treasury



stock method, the dilutive impact of restricted stock and
restricted stock units using the treasury stock method, and
conversion of debt, if dilutive in the period. Potentially
dilutive common shares are excluded in net loss periods, as
their effect would be antidilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation awards to employees
using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion, or APB, No. 25,

Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees

, and to non-employees using the
fair value method in accordance with SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.

In addition, we
apply applicable provisions of FIN 44,

Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an
Interpretation of APB No. 25.

As discussed in
Note 3, in connection with the acquisition of Veritas, we
assumed outstanding options to purchase shares of Veritas common
stock and converted them into options to
purchase 66 million shares of Symantec common stock.

Pro forma information regarding net income and net income per
share is required by SFAS No. 123. This information is
required to be determined as if we had accounted for our
employee stock options, including shares issued under the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, granted subsequent to
March 31, 1995, under the fair value method of that
statement. The following table illustrates the effect on net
income and net income per share as if we had applied the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to
stock-based employee compensation using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model for the three years ended March 31,
2006, 2005, and 2004:


Includes a charge of $18 million resulting from the
    inclusion of unamortized expense for ESPP offering periods that
    were cancelled as a result of a plan amendment to eliminate the
    two-year offering period effective July 1, 2005. Also
    includes a charge resulting from the acceleration of certain
    stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than
    $27 per share outstanding on March 30, 2006.

In light of new accounting guidance under
SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, which
addresses option valuation for employee awards, we have
reevaluated our assumptions used in estimating the fair value of
employee options granted beginning in the December 2005 quarter.
Based on this assessment, management has determined that
historical volatility adjusted for the effect of implied
volatility is a better indicator of expected volatility than
historical volatility alone. Also, beginning with the December
2005 quarter, we decreased our estimate of the expected life of
new options granted to our employees from five years to three
years. The reduction in the estimated expected life was a result
of an analysis of our historical experience and a decrease in
the contractual term of the options from ten to seven years. As
a result of the change from solely historical volatility to
historical volatility adjusted to reflect the effect of implied
volatility and the reduction of



the expected life, the pro forma expense will be reduced by an
aggregate of approximately $32 million over the four-year
average vesting period beginning with options granted in the
quarter ended December 31, 2005.

For the pro forma amounts determined under
SFAS No. 123, as set forth above, the fair value of
each stock option granted under the stock option plans or
assumed in a business combination is estimated on the date of
grant or assumption using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions:

Employee

The weighted average estimated fair value of employee stock
options granted in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $7.81,
$15.46, and $8.73 per share, respectively. The weighted
average estimated fair value of employee stock purchase rights
granted under the ESPP in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $3.16,
$8.19, and $4.36, respectively.

For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value
of the options is amortized to expense using the straight-line
method over the options’ vesting period for employee stock
options and over the six-month purchase period for stock
purchases under the ESPP.

On March 30, 2006, we accelerated the vesting of certain
stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than
$27.00 per share that were outstanding on that date. We did
not accelerate the vesting of any stock options held by our
executive officers or directors. The vesting of options to
purchase approximately 6.7 million shares of common stock,
or approximately 14% of our outstanding unvested options, was
accelerated. The weighted average exercise price of the stock
options for which vesting was accelerated was $28.73. We
accelerated the vesting of the options to reduce future
stock-based compensation expense that we would otherwise be
required to recognize in our results of operations after
adoption of SFAS No. 123R. We adopted
SFAS No. 123R on April 1, 2006, which is the
beginning of our 2007 fiscal year. Because of system
constraints, it is not practicable for us to estimate the amount
by which the acceleration of vesting will reduce our future

stock-based

compensation expense. The acceleration of the vesting of these
options did not result in a charge to expense in fiscal 2006.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

A significant portion of our revenues and net income is derived
from international sales and independent agents and
distributors. Fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against
foreign currencies, changes in local regulatory or economic
conditions, piracy, or nonperformance by independent agents or
distributors could adversely affect operating results.

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and
cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade accounts
receivable, and forward foreign exchange contracts. Our
investment portfolio is diversified and consists of investment
grade securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of
credit risk exposure to any one issuer and in any one country.
We are exposed to credit risks in the event of default by the
issuers to the extent of the amount recorded in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. The credit risk in our trade accounts receivable
is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process,
reasonably short collection terms, and the geographical
dispersion of sales transactions. We maintain reserves for
potential credit losses and such losses have been within
management’s expectations.

Legal Expenses

We accrue estimated legal expenses when the likelihood of the
incurrence of the related costs is probable and management has
the ability to estimate such costs. If both of these conditions
are not met, management



records the related legal expenses when incurred. Amounts that
we accrue are not discounted. The material assumptions used to
estimate the amount of legal expenses include:

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

We report comprehensive income or loss in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 130,

Reporting Comprehensive
Income,

which establishes standards for reporting
comprehensive income and its components in the financial
statements. The components of other comprehensive income (loss)
consist of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities, net of tax, and foreign currency translation
adjustments, net of tax. Unrealized gains and losses on our
available-for-sale securities were $6 million in fiscal
2006 and insignificant in fiscal 2005 and 2004. Comprehensive
income is presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statements
of Stockholders’ Equity and Comprehensive Income.

Newly Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements

In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
FASB, issued SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain
Hybrid Financial Instruments

, which amends
SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities

, and SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities.

SFAS No. 155
simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in
other financial instruments by allowing them to be accounted for
as a whole if the holder elects to account for the entire
instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS No. 155 also
clarifies and amends certain other provisions of
SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140.
SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial
instruments acquired, issued, or subject to a remeasurement
event occurring in fiscal years beginning after
September 15, 2006. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided
the company has not yet issued financial statements, including
for interim periods, for that fiscal year. We do not expect the
adoption of SFAS No. 155 to have a material impact on
our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows.

In June 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position, or FSP,
FAS

143-1,

Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations

,
which provides guidance on the accounting for certain
obligations associated with the Directive on Waste Electrical
and Electronic Equipment, or the Directive, which was adopted by
the European Union, or the EU. Under the Directive, the waste
management obligation for historical equipment, defined as
products put on the market on or prior to August 13, 2005,
remains with the commercial user until the equipment is
replaced. FSP
FAS

143-1

is
required to be applied to the later of the first fiscal period
ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the
Directive’s adoption into law by the applicable EU member
countries in which we have significant operations. We are
currently evaluating the impact of FSP
FAS

143-1

on our
financial position and results of operations. The effects will
depend on the respective laws adopted by the EU member countries.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

, which replaces
APB No. 20,

Accounting Changes

, and
SFAS No. 3,

Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial Statements — An Amendment of APB Opinion
No. 28.

SFAS No. 154 provides guidance on
accounting for and reporting changes in accounting principle and
error corrections. SFAS No. 154 requires that changes
in accounting principle be applied retrospectively to prior
period financial statements and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2005. When adopted and if
used, SFAS No. 154 would have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, which requires companies to measure
and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payments
at fair value. SFAS No. 123R is effective for annual
periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and, thus, will be
effective for us beginning with the



first quarter of fiscal 2007. Generally, the approach in
SFAS No. 123R is similar to the approach described in
SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123R
requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants
of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock
purchase plans, to be recognized in the Consolidated Statements
of Income based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure of
fair value recognition will no longer be an alternative. See

Stock-Based Compensation

above for information related to
the pro forma effects on our reported net income and net income
per share when applying the fair value recognition provisions of
the previous SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee
compensation. On April 1, 2006, we adopted
SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method.
We expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123R to have a
material impact on our consolidated financial position and
results of operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets — An Amendment of
APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions.

SFAS No. 153 eliminates the
exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges
of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB
Opinion No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions

, and replaces it with an exception for
exchanges that do not have commercial substance.
SFAS No. 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has
commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are
expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange.
SFAS No. 153 is effective for fiscal periods beginning
after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 153
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flow.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 109-1,

Application of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting
for Income Taxes,” to the Tax Deduction on Qualified
Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004.

The American Jobs Creation Act introduces a special
tax deduction on qualified production activities. FSP
FAS 109-1 clarifies that this tax deduction should be
accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with
SFAS No. 109. FSP FAS 109-1 did not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial position, results
of operations, or cash flows.

Note 3.

Acquisitions

Fiscal 2006 acquisitions

Acquisition of Veritas Software Corporation

On July 2, 2005, we completed our acquisition of Veritas, a
leading provider of software and services to enable storage and
backup, whereby Veritas became a wholly owned subsidiary of
Symantec in a transaction accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting. The total purchase price of
$13.2 billion includes Symantec common stock valued at
$12.5 billion, assumed stock options and restricted stock
units, or RSUs, with a fair value of $699 million, and
acquisition-related expenses of $39 million. The combined
company offers customers a broad portfolio of leading software
and solutions across all tiers of the infrastructure. In
addition, we believe that bringing together the market leading
capabilities of Symantec and Veritas improves our ability to
continuously optimize performance and help companies recover
from disruptions when they occur.

As a result of the acquisition, we issued approximately
483 million shares of Symantec common stock, net of
treasury stock retained, based on an exchange ratio of
1.1242 shares of Symantec common stock for each outstanding
share of Veritas common stock as of July 2, 2005. The
common stock issued had a fair value



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

of $12.5 billion and was valued using the average closing
price of our common stock of $25.87 over a range of trading days
(December 14, 2004 through December 20, 2004,
inclusive) around the announcement date (December 16, 2004)
of the transaction.

Under the terms of the agreement, we also assumed each
outstanding option to purchase Veritas common stock with an
exercise price equal to or less than $49.00 as well as each
additional option required to be assumed by applicable law. Each
option assumed was converted into an option to purchase Symantec
common stock after applying the exchange ratio. All other
options to purchase shares of Veritas common stock not exercised
prior to the acquisition were cancelled immediately prior to the
acquisition and were not converted or assumed by Symantec. In
total, we assumed and converted Veritas options into options to
purchase 66 million shares of Symantec common stock.
In addition, we assumed and converted all outstanding Veritas
RSUs into approximately 425,000 Symantec RSUs, based on the
exchange ratio.

Acquisition-related costs of $39 million consist of
$32 million for accounting, legal, and other professional
fees and $7 million of restructuring costs for severance,
associated benefits, outplacement services, and excess
facilities. As of March 31, 2006, substantially all costs
for accounting, legal, and other professional fees have been
paid. Total cash expenditures as of March 31, 2006 for
restructuring costs for severance, associated benefits,
outplacement services, and excess facilities were approximately
$4 million. Acquisition-related costs are included in Other
accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The acquisition was structured to qualify as a tax-free
reorganization and we have accounted for the acquisition using
the purchase method of accounting. The results of operations of
Veritas have been included in the Consolidated Statements of
Income beginning on July 2, 2005 and had a significant
impact on our revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses.

The Veritas business is included in our Data Protection, Storage
and Server Management, and Services segments.

Purchase price allocation

In accordance with SFAS No. 141,

Business
Combinations

, the total purchase price was allocated to
Veritas’ net tangible and intangible assets based on their
estimated fair values as of July 2, 2005. The excess
purchase price over the value of the net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. The
fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed are based on



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial

estimates and assumptions provided by management. The following
represents the allocation of the purchase price to the acquired
net assets of Veritas and the associated estimated useful lives:


The Veritas backlog included in Acquired product rights was
    charged to Cost of revenues in the September 2005 quarter.


Estimated weighted-average remaining vesting period.

The purchase price allocation may be adjusted in future periods
pending resolution of the Veritas pre-acquisition income tax
matters discussed in Note 13.

Net tangible assets

Veritas’ tangible assets and liabilities as of July 2,
2005 were reviewed and adjusted to their fair value as
necessary, including a write down in the amount of
$113 million relating to land owned in various locations.
Net tangible assets include net deferred tax assets of
$223 million and income taxes payable of $269 million.

Deferred revenue

In connection with the acquisition of Veritas, we assumed
Veritas’ contractual obligations related to its deferred
revenue. Veritas’ deferred revenue was derived from
licenses, maintenance, consulting, education, and other
services. We estimated our obligation related to the Veritas
deferred revenue using the cost

build-up

approach. The
cost

build-up

approach
determines fair value by estimating the costs relating to
fulfilling the obligation plus a normal profit margin. The sum
of the costs and operating profit approximates, in theory, the
amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume
the support obligation. The estimated costs to fulfill the
support obligation were based on the historical direct costs
related to providing the support. As a result, we recorded an
adjustment to reduce the carrying value of deferred revenue by
$359 million to $173 million, which represents our
estimate of the fair value of the contractual obligations
assumed.

Identifiable intangible assets

Acquired product rights include developed and core technology,
patents, and backlog. Developed technology relates to
Veritas’ products across all of their product lines that
have reached technological feasibility. Core technology and
patents represent a combination of Veritas processes, patents,
and trade secrets developed through years of experience in
design and development of their products. Backlog relates to
firm customer orders that generally are scheduled for delivery
within the next quarter, as well as OEM revenues that are
reported in the next quarter. We amortized the fair value of the
backlog to Cost of revenues in the September 2005 quarter. We
are amortizing the fair values of all other Acquired product
rights to Cost of revenues on a straight-line basis over their
estimated lives of four to five years.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

Customer contracts and relationships represent existing
contracts that relate primarily to underlying customer
relationships. We are amortizing the fair values of these assets
to Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income
on a straight-line basis over an average estimated life of
eight years.

Trade names relate to the Veritas product names that will
continue in use. We are amortizing the fair values of these
assets to Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of
Income on a straight-line basis over an estimated life of
ten years.

Goodwill

Approximately $8.6 billion of the purchase price has been
allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the underlying net
tangible and intangible assets. The goodwill was attributed to
the premium paid for the opportunity to expand and better serve
the addressable market and achieve greater long-term growth
opportunities than either company had operating alone.
Management believes that the combined company will be better
positioned to deliver security and availability solutions across
all platforms, from the desktop to the data center, to customers
ranging from consumers and small businesses to large
organizations and service providers. Goodwill recorded as a
result of this acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill will not be
amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least
annually (more frequently if certain indicators are present). In
the event that management determines that the value of goodwill
has become impaired, we would incur an accounting charge for the
amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the
determination is made.

In-process research and development (IPR&D)

We wrote off acquired IPR&D totaling $284 million in
connection with our acquisition of Veritas. The IPR&D was
written off because the acquired technologies had not reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative uses.
Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to
completion of a beta-phase working prototype in which there is
no remaining risk relating to the development. At the time of
the acquisition, Veritas was developing new products in multiple
product areas that qualify as IPR&D. These efforts included
NetBackup 6.1, Backup Exec 11.0, Server Management 5.0, and
various other projects. At the time of the acquisition, it was
estimated that these IPR&D efforts would be completed over
the following 12 to 18 months at an estimated total cost of
$120 million. As of March 31, 2006, the development
efforts were continuing on schedule and within expected costs.

The value assigned to IPR&D was determined by estimating
costs to develop the purchased IPR&D into commercially
viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from
the projects when completed, and discounting the net cash flows
to their present value. The revenue estimates used in the net
cash flow forecasts were based on estimates of relevant market
sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology, and the
nature and expected timing of new product introductions by
Veritas and its competitors.

The rate utilized to discount the net cash flows to their
present value was based on Veritas’ weighted average cost
of capital. The weighted average cost of capital was adjusted to
reflect the difficulties and uncertainties in completing each
project and thereby achieving technological feasibility, the
percentage of completion of each project, anticipated market
acceptance and penetration, market growth rates, and risks
related to the impact of potential changes in future target
markets. Based on these factors, a discount rate of 13.5% was
deemed appropriate for valuing the IPR&D.

The estimates used in valuing IPR&D were based upon
assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently
uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or
inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

Deferred stock-based compensation

We assumed Veritas’ stock options and RSUs, and converted
them into stock options to purchase 66 million shares
of Symantec common stock and 425,000 Symantec RSUs. The fair
value of the assumed stock options was $688 million using
the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following weighted
average assumptions: volatility of 36%, risk-free interest rate
of 3.4%, expected life of 3.5 years, and dividend yield of
zero. The fair value of the RSUs was $11 million based on
the fair value of the underlying shares on the announcement
date. The intrinsic value of the unvested options and RSUs was
valued at $63 million and was recorded in Deferred
stock-based compensation within Stockholders’ equity in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets in the September 2005 quarter. The
difference between the fair value and the intrinsic value of the
unvested portion of the options and RSUs was $636 million
and was included in the purchase price consideration.

The deferred stock-based compensation is being amortized to
operating expense over the remaining vesting periods of the
underlying options or RSUs on a straight-line basis. During the
period from the acquisition date through March 31, 2006,
certain unvested options and RSUs were cancelled as a result of
employee terminations, and deferred stock-based compensation was
reduced by $6 million. We recorded amortization of deferred
stock-based compensation from the Veritas transaction of
$27 million in fiscal 2006.

Deferred tax liability

We have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
tax effects of differences between assigned values in the
purchase price and the tax bases of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. A significant portion of the net deferred
tax liability in the purchase price allocation is attributable
to the tax effect of the difference between the assigned value
of identified intangible assets and their tax bases. In
determining the tax effect of these basis differences, we have
taken into account the allocation of these identified
intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions, including
those with nominal or zero percent tax rates.

Short-term loan

In connection with the acquisition of Veritas, we assumed a
short-term loan with a principal amount of
EURO 411 million. We paid the entire balance of the
short-term loan on July 7, 2005.

Other fiscal 2006 acquisitions

During fiscal 2006, in addition to Veritas, we completed
acquisitions of five privately-held companies and one public
company for an aggregate of $627 million in cash, including
acquisition-related expenses resulting from financial advisory,
legal and accounting services, duplicate sites, and severance
costs of approximately $18 million, of which approximately
$7 million remains as an accrual as of March 31, 2006.
We recorded goodwill in connection with each of these
acquisitions. In each acquisition, goodwill resulted primarily
from our expectation of synergies from the integration of the
acquired company’s technology with our technology and the
acquired company’s access to our global distribution
network. In addition, each acquired company provided a
knowledgeable and experienced workforce. The results of
operations for the acquired companies have been included in our

following transactions:

On October 7, 2005, in connection with the acquisition of
Sygate, we obtained certain acquired product rights related to
patent licenses held by Sygate valued at approximately
$18 million. The Acquired product rights are being
amortized to Cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of
Income over their estimated life of twelve years.

On May 12, 2005, we resolved patent litigation matters with
Altiris, Inc. by entering into a cross-licensing agreement that
resolved all legal claims between the companies. As part of the
settlement, we paid Altiris $10 million for use of the
disputed technology. Under the transaction, we expensed
$2 million of patent settlement costs in the June 2005
quarter that was related to benefits received by us in and prior
to the June 2005 quarter. The remaining $8 million was
recorded as Acquired product rights and is being amortized to
Cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income over
the remaining life of the primary patent, which expires in May
2017.

On August 6, 2003, we purchased a security technology
patent as part of a settlement in

Hilgraeve, Inc. v.
Symantec Corporation.

As part of the settlement, we also
received licenses to the remaining patents in Hilgraeve’s
portfolio. The total cost of purchasing the patent and licensing
additional patents was $63 million, which was paid in cash
in August 2003. Under the transaction, we recorded
$14 million of patent settlement costs in the June 2003
quarter that were related to benefits received by us in and
prior to the June 2003 quarter. The remaining $49 million
was recorded as Acquired product rights and is being amortized
to Cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income
over the remaining life of the primary patent, which expires in
June 2011.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial

On April 17, 2003, we purchased acquired product rights
related to Roxio Inc.’s GoBack computer recovery software
business for $13 million in cash. The acquired product
rights are being amortized to Cost of revenues in the
Consolidated Statements of Income over their estimated life of
three years.

In fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, amortization expense for
acquired product rights was $314 million, $49 million,
and $41 million, respectively. Amortization of acquired
product rights was included in Cost of revenues in the
Consolidated Statements of Income. The weighted average
remaining estimated lives of acquired product rights are
approximately four years for developed technology,
approximately seven years for patents, and less than one
year for backlog and other. The weighted average remaining
estimated life of acquired product rights in total is
approximately four years. Annual amortization of acquired
product rights, based upon our existing acquired product rights
and their current useful lives, is estimated to be the following
as of March 31, 2006:

Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are as
follows:



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

As of March 31, 2006, the unrealized losses in the above
table relate to short-term investment securities for which the
fair value is less than the cost basis. In all cases, this
condition has existed for less than one year. We expect to
receive the full principal and interest on these securities.
When evaluating our investments for possible impairment, we
review factors such as the length of time and extent to which
fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of
the investee, and our ability and intent to hold the investment
for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated
recovery in market value. The changes in the values in the above
securities are considered to be temporary in nature and,
accordingly, we do not believe that the values of these
securities are impaired as of March 31, 2006. Unrealized
gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are reported
as a component of Stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

The estimated fair value of cash equivalents and short-term
investments by contractual maturity as of March 31, 2006 is

Equity investments in privately held companies

As of March 31, 2006 and 2005, we held equity investments
with a carrying value of $11 million, in several
privately-held companies. These investments are recorded at cost
as we do not have significant influence over the investees and
are included in Other long-term assets in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recognized
declines in value of these investments that were determined to
be other-than-temporary of $4 million, $1 million, and
$3 million, respectively. The other-than-temporary declines
in fair value were recorded as Interest and other income, net in
the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Note 6.

Convertible Subordinated Notes

In connection with the acquisition of Veritas, we assumed the
Veritas 0.25% convertible subordinated notes. In August
2003, Veritas issued $520 million of 0.25% convertible
subordinated notes due August 1,



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

2013, or 0.25% Notes, to several initial purchasers in a
private offering. The 0.25% Notes were issued at their face
value and provide for semi-annual interest payments of an
insignificant amount each February 1 and August 1,
beginning February 1, 2004. On July 2, 2005, in
connection with the acquisition, Veritas, Symantec, and
U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, entered into a
Second Supplemental Indenture. As a result of the Second
Supplemental Indenture, the 0.25% Notes became convertible,
under specified circumstances, into shares of common stock of
Symantec at a conversion rate of 24.37288 shares per $1,000
principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to a conversion
price of approximately $41.03 per share of Symantec common
stock. Symantec agreed to fully and unconditionally guarantee
all of Veritas’ obligations under the 0.25% Notes and
the indenture, including all payments of principal and interest.

The conversion rate of the 0.25% Notes is subject to
adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. On or after
August 5, 2006, Symantec has the option to redeem all or a
portion of the 0.25% Notes at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
On August 1, 2006 and August 1, 2008, or upon the
occurrence of a fundamental change involving Symantec, holders
of the 0.25% Notes may require Symantec to repurchase their
notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Standard & Poor’s withdrew its corporate credit
rating for Veritas on July 6, 2005 and, as a result, the
0.25% Notes are currently convertible into shares of
Symantec common stock at the option of the holder. If any holder
elected to convert, Symantec would pay the holder the cash value
of the applicable number of shares of Symantec common stock
($16.83 per share at March 31, 2006), up to the
principal amount of the note in accordance with the terms of a
supplemental indenture dated as of October 25, 2004.
Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid
in cash or in stock at Symantec’s option. As of the
acquisition of Veritas, the fair value of the 0.25% Notes
was $496 million. We will accrete the value of the
0.25% Notes to their face value by August 1, 2006, the
first date that holders may require us to repurchase the
0.25% Notes. The book value of the 0.25% Notes was
$513 million as of March 31, 2006.

On October 24, 2001, we completed a private offering of
$600 million 3% convertible subordinated notes due
November 1, 2006, the net proceeds of which were
$585 million. The notes were convertible into shares of our
common stock by the holders at any time before maturity at a
conversion price of $8.54 per share, subject to certain
adjustments. We had the right to redeem the remaining notes on
or after November 5, 2004, at a redemption price of 100.75%
of stated principal during the period November 5, 2004
through October 31, 2005. Interest was paid semi-annually
and we commenced making these payments on May 1, 2002. Debt
issuance costs of $16 million related to the notes were
being amortized on a straight-line basis through
November 1, 2006. We had reserved 70.3 million shares
of common stock for issuance upon conversion of the notes. On
July 20, 2004, our Board of Directors approved the
redemption of all of the outstanding convertible subordinated
notes. As of November 4, 2004 (the day prior to the
redemption date), substantially all of the outstanding
convertible subordinated notes were converted into
70.3 million shares of our common stock. The remainder was
redeemed for cash. Unamortized debt issuance costs of
$6 million relative to the converted notes were charged to
Capital in excess of par value in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets during fiscal 2005.

Rent expense charged to operations totaled $70 million,
$35 million, and $27 million in fiscal 2006, 2005, and
2004, respectively.

Development agreements

In the June 2005 quarter, we entered into agreements in
connection with the construction of or refurbishments to
buildings in Springfield, Oregon and Culver City, California.
Payment is contingent upon the achievement of certain
agreed-upon milestones. The remaining commitment is
$147 million as of March 31, 2006 which mainly relates
to the construction of the Culver City, California facility.

Royalties

We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment
and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally
based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of
underlying revenue. Certain royalty commitments have minimum
commitment obligations; however, as of March 31, 2006 all
such obligations are immaterial.

Indemnification

As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we
indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or
occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at
our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of
future payments we could be required to make under these
indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have
director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our
exposure and enables us to recover a portion or all of any
future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of
these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable
insurance coverage is minimal.

Note 8.     Stock
Transactions

Stock repurchases

We have operated a stock repurchase program since 2001. On
March 28, 2005, the Board of Directors increased the dollar
amount of authorized stock repurchases by $3 billion, which
became effective upon completion of the Veritas acquisition on
July 2, 2005. We commenced repurchases under the
$3 billion authorization on August 2, 2005 and as of
December 31, 2005 all authorized repurchases, including
$474 million from prior authorizations, were completed.

On January 31, 2006, the Board, through one of its
committees, authorized the repurchase of $1 billion of
Symantec common stock, without a scheduled expiration date. In
connection with this stock repurchase authorization, we entered
into Rule

10b5-1

trading plans intended to facilitate stock repurchases of



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

$125 million per quarter during fiscal 2007. We used
$154 million of the authorized amount to repurchase shares
in the open market in the March 2006 quarter and we intend to
use the remaining amount to make stock repurchases under Rule
10b5-1 trading plans and opportunistically in fiscal 2007.

In fiscal 2006, we repurchased 174 million shares at prices
ranging from $15.83 to $23.85 for an aggregate amount of
$3.6 billion. In fiscal 2005, we repurchased
eight million shares at prices ranging from $21.05 to
$30.77 per share, for an aggregate amount of
$192 million. In fiscal 2004, we repurchased
three million shares at prices ranging from $19.52 to
$20.82 per share, for an aggregate amount of
$60 million. As of March 31, 2006, $846 million
remained authorized for future repurchases.

Stock dividends

On October 19, 2004, our Board of Directors approved a
two-for-one stock split to be effected in the form of a stock
dividend. Stockholders of record at the close of business on
November 11, 2004 were issued one additional share of
common stock for each share owned as of that date. An additional
353 million shares resulting from the stock dividend were
issued in book-entry form on November 30, 2004.

On October 22, 2003, our Board of Directors approved a
two-for-one stock split to be effected in the form of a stock
dividend. Stockholders of record at the close of business on
November 5, 2003 were issued one additional share of common
stock for each share owned as of that date. An additional
154 million shares resulting from the stock dividend were
issued in book-entry form on November 19, 2003.

Increase to authorized shares

On June 24, 2005, our stockholders approved the adoption of
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which
increased the number of authorized shares of common stock to
3,000,000,000 from 1,600,000,000. The increase was sought in
order to carry out our acquisition of Veritas. On
September 15, 2004, our stockholders approved the adoption
of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which
increased the number of authorized shares of common stock to
1,600,000,000 from 900,000,000.

Note 10.

Adoption of Stockholder Rights Plan

On August 11, 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a
stockholder rights plan designed to ensure orderly consideration
of any future unsolicited acquisition attempt to ensure a fair
value of Symantec for our stockholders. In connection with the
plan, the Board of Directors declared and paid a dividend of one
preferred share purchase right for each share of Symantec common
stock outstanding on the record date, August 21,



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

1998. The rights are initially attached to Symantec common stock
and will not trade separately. If a person or a group, an
Acquiring Person, acquires 20% or more of our common stock, or
announces an intention to make a tender offer for 20% or more of
our common stock, the rights will be distributed and will
thereafter trade separately from the common stock.

If the rights become exercisable, each right (other than rights
held by the Acquiring Person) will entitle the holder to
purchase, at a price equal to the exercise price of the right, a
number of shares of our common stock having a then-current value
of twice the exercise price of the right. If, after the rights
become exercisable, we agree to merge into another entity or we
sell more than 50% of our assets, each right will entitle the
holder to purchase, at a price equal to the exercise price of
the right, a number of shares of common stock of such entity
having a then-current value of twice the exercise price.

We may exchange the rights at a ratio of one share of common
stock for each right (other than the Acquiring Person) at any
time after an Acquiring Person acquires 20% or more of our
common stock but before such person acquires 50% or more of our
common stock. We may also redeem the rights at our option at a
price of $0.001 per right at any time before an Acquiring
Person has acquired 20% or more of our common stock. The rights
will expire on August 12, 2008.

Note 11.

Employee Benefits

401(k) plan

We maintain a salary deferral 401(k) plan for all of our
domestic employees. This plan allows employees to contribute up
to 50% of their pretax salary up to the maximum dollar
limitation prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. We match 50%
of the employee’s contribution. The maximum match in any
given plan year is the lower of 3% of the employees’
eligible compensation or $6,000. Our contributions under the
plan were $14 million, $8 million, and $7 million
in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

Stock purchase plans

2002 Executive Officers’ Stock Purchase Plan

In September 2002, our stockholders approved the 2002 Executive
Officers’ Stock Purchase Plan and reserved
250,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder, of
which no shares are subject to adjustment pursuant to changes in
capital. The purpose of the plan is to provide executive
officers with a means to acquire an equity interest in Symantec
at fair market value by applying a portion or all of their
respective bonus payments towards the purchase price. Each
executive officer may purchase up to 10,000 shares in any
fiscal year. As of March 31, 2006, 25,413 shares have
been issued under the plan and 224,587 shares remain
available for future issuance. Shares reserved for issuance
under this plan have not been adjusted for the stock dividends.

1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In September 1998, our stockholders approved the 1998 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, and reserved 4.0 million
shares of common stock for issuance thereunder. In September
1999, the ESPP was amended by our stockholders to increase the
shares available for issuance by 6.1 million and to add an
“evergreen” provision whereby the number of shares
available for issuance increased automatically on January 1 of
each year (beginning in 2000) by 1% of our outstanding shares of
common stock on each immediately preceding December 31
during the term of the plan. In July 2004, the Board of
Directors eliminated this provision. As of March 31, 2006,
18.4 million shares remain available for issuance under the
plan.

Subject to certain limitations, our employees may elect to have
2% to 10% of their compensation withheld through payroll
deductions to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP.
Employees purchase shares of common stock at a price per share
equal to 85% of the fair market value on the purchase date at
the end of each six-month purchase period. For purchases prior
to July 1, 2005, employees purchased shares at a price



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value as of the
beginning of the two-year offering period or the end of the
six-month purchase period. The Board of Directors eliminated the
two-year offering period in March 2005, effective July 1,
2005. Under the ESPP, 3.9 million, 3.2 million, and
2.9 million shares were issued during fiscal 2006, 2005,
and 2004, respectively, representing $59 million,
$32 million, and $23 million in contributions,
respectively. As of March 31, 2006, a total of
20.2 million shares had been issued under this plan.

Stock award plan

2000 Director Equity Incentive Plan

In September 2000, our stockholders approved the
2000 Director Equity Incentive Plan and reserved
50,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder. In
September 2004, stockholders increased the number of shares of
stock that may be issued by 50,000. The purpose of this plan is
to provide the members of the Board of Directors with an
opportunity to receive common stock for all or a portion of the
retainer payable to each director for serving as a member. Each
director may elect to receive 50% to 100% of the retainer to be
paid in the form of stock. As of March 31, 2006, a total of
58,468 shares had been issued under this plan and
41,532 shares remained available for future issuance.

Stock option plans

We maintain stock option plans pursuant to which the Board of
Directors, or a committee of the Board of Directors, may grant
incentive and nonqualified stock options to employees, officers,
directors, consultants, independent contractors, and advisors to
us, or of any parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of Symantec. The
purpose of these plans is to attract, retain, and motivate
eligible persons whose present and potential contributions are
important to our success by offering them an opportunity to
participate in our future performance through awards of stock
options and stock bonuses. Under the terms of these plans, the
option exercise price may not be less than 100% of the fair
market value on the date of grant and options generally vest
over a four-year period. Options granted prior to October 2005
generally have a maximum term of ten years and options granted
thereafter generally have a maximum term of seven years.

2004 and 1996 Equity Incentive Plans

In September 2004, stockholders approved the terms of the 2004
Equity Incentive Plan and reserved 18.0 million shares for
issuance thereunder. An additional 9.5 million shares were
transferred to this plan from the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan
upon that plan’s expiration in March 2006. Under the 2004
Equity Incentive Plan, we may grant options, stock appreciation
rights, RSUs, or restricted stock awards to employees, officers,
directors, consultants, independent contractors, and advisors to
us, or of any parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of Symantec as
the Board of Directors or committee may determine. A maximum of
10% of the shares reserved under the plan may be granted in the
form of restricted stock awards. Under the terms of this plan,
the Compensation Committee determines whether an option will be
an incentive stock option or a non-qualified stock option. This
plan superseded the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan upon its
expiration. As of March 31, 2006, 25.8 million shares
remain available for future grant.

During fiscal 2006, we granted an aggregate of 200,000 RSUs to
two officers. The market value of the underlying common stock on
the dates of grant was $3 million, which was recorded in
Deferred stock-based compensation within Stockholders’
equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in fiscal 2006. The
deferred stock-based compensation is being amortized over the
three to four-year vesting periods.

On October 20, 2004, we issued 200,000 restricted shares of
common stock to our then-current Chief Financial Officer, at a
purchase price of $1,000 (representing the aggregate par value
at the time of issuance), vesting 50% at each anniversary date.
The market value of the common stock on the date of grant, less
the purchase price, was $6 million and was recorded in
Deferred stock-based compensation within Stockholders’
equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in fiscal 2005. Upon
the retirement of the former Chief Financial



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

Officer in December 2005, 100,000 shares were forfeited and
we reversed the related deferred stock-based compensation.

We recorded amortization of deferred stock-based compensation
related to restricted stock and restricted stock units issued
under the 2004 and 1996 Equity Incentive Plans of
$2 million and $1 million during fiscal 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

Assumed Veritas stock options

In connection with our acquisition of Veritas, we assumed each
outstanding option to purchase Veritas common stock with an
exercise price equal to or less than $49.00 as well as each
additional option required to be assumed by applicable law. Each
option assumed was converted into an option to purchase Symantec
common stock after applying the exchange ratio of
1.1242 shares of Symantec common stock for each share of
Veritas common stock. In total, we assumed and converted Veritas
options into options to purchase 66 million shares of
Symantec common stock. In addition, we assumed and converted all
outstanding Veritas RSUs into approximately 425,000 Symantec
RSUs, based on the exchange ratio.

The assumed options and RSUs retained all applicable terms and
vesting periods. In general, the assumed options vest over a
four-year period from the original date of grant. Options
granted prior to May 2004 generally have a maximum term of
10 years and options granted thereafter generally have a
maximum term of seven years. The assumed RSUs generally vest
over a three or four year period from the original date of grant.

Other stock option plans

Options remain outstanding under several other stock option
plans, including the 2001 Non-Qualified Equity Incentive Plan,
the 1999 Acquisition Plan, the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan, the
1988 Employee Stock Option Plan, and various plans assumed in
connection with acquisitions. No further options may be granted
under any of these plans.

Acceleration of stock option vesting

On March 30, 2006, we accelerated the vesting of certain
stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than
$27.00 per share that were outstanding on that date. We did
not accelerate the vesting of any stock options held by our
executive officers or directors. The vesting of options to
purchase approximately 6.7 million shares of common stock,
or approximately 14% of our outstanding unvested options, was
accelerated. The weighted average exercise price of the stock
options for which vesting was accelerated was $28.73. We
accelerated the vesting of the options to reduce future
stock-based compensation expense that we would otherwise be
required to recognize in our results of operations after
adoption of SFAS No. 123R. We adopted
SFAS No. 123R on April 1, 2006, which is the
beginning of our 2007 fiscal year. Because of system
constraints, it is not practicable for us to estimate the amount
by which the acceleration of vesting will reduce our future
stock-based compensation expense. The acceleration of the
vesting of these options did not result in a charge to expense
in fiscal 2006.

In January and March 2006, we accelerated the vesting of options
held by three former officers of Veritas upon their resignation
from Symantec. We accelerated the vesting of options to purchase
an aggregate of 728,106 shares and recorded a charge to
Stock-based compensation expense of $441,000 in connection with
the modification of these stock options.

Restructuring

As of March 31, 2006, we had a restructuring reserve of
$30 million, of which $20 million was included in
Other accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
$10 million was included in Other long-term liabilities in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The restructuring reserve
consists of $9 million related to a



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

restructuring reserve assumed from Veritas in connection with
the acquisition, $21 million related to restructuring
reserves established in fiscal 2006, and an insignificant amount
related to our fiscal 2002 restructuring plan. Restructuring
reserves established in fiscal 2006 include $9 million
related to our 2006 restructuring plan, $3 million related
to restructuring costs as a result of the Veritas acquisition,
and $9 million related to restructuring costs as a result
of our other acquisitions.

Restructuring expense

In fiscal 2006, we recorded $25 million of restructuring
costs, of which $18 million related to severance,
associated benefits, and outplacement services and
$7 million related to excess facilities. These
restructuring costs reflect the termination of 446 redundant
employees located in the United States, Europe, and Asia Pacific
and the consolidation of certain facilities in Europe and Asia
Pacific. In fiscal 2006, we paid $16 million related to
this restructuring reserve. We expect the remainder of the costs
to be paid by the end of fiscal 2018.

In fiscal 2005, we recorded $3 million of restructuring
charges, of which $2 million was for costs of severance,
related benefits, and outplacement services related to the
termination of 51 employees located in the U.S. and Europe due
to the consolidation and relocation of engineering and
development functions. In addition we recorded an increase to
the accrual relating to the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan of
$1 million due to the termination of a sublease agreement
for facilities in Eugene, Oregon. Substantially all of the costs
had been paid by March 31, 2005.

In fiscal 2004, we recorded $1 million of restructuring
charges for costs of severance, related benefits, and
outplacement services for a member of our senior management
team, as well as an increase to the accrual for excess
facilities in Eugene, Oregon in connection with our fiscal 2002
restructuring plan. Substantially all of the costs had been paid
by March 31, 2005.

The fiscal 2002 restructuring reserve consisted of the costs of
excess facilities in Europe and Eugene, Oregon, net of sublease
income. In fiscal 2006, we paid $2 million upon termination
of the remaining leases. Substantially all of the costs had been
paid by March 31, 2006.

Amounts related to restructuring expense are included in
Restructuring in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Acquisition-related restructuring

In connection with the Veritas acquisition on July 2, 2005,
we assumed a restructuring reserve of $53 million related
to the 2002 Veritas facilities restructuring plan. From the date
of the acquisition through March 31, 2006, we paid
$25 million related to this reserve. Also during this
period, we reduced this reserve by $19 million as we
returned some facilities to use and negotiated early lease
terminations on others for amounts less than originally accrued.
The remaining reserve amount of $9 million will be paid
over the remaining lease terms, ending at various dates through
2022. The majority of costs are currently scheduled to be paid
by the end of fiscal 2011.

With regard to the 2002 Veritas facilities restructuring plan,
our actual costs have varied and could continue to vary
significantly from our current estimates, depending, in part, on
the commercial real estate market in the applicable metropolitan
areas, our ability to obtain subleases related to these
facilities and the time period to do so, the sublease rental
market rates, and the outcome of negotiations with lessors
regarding terminations of some of the leases. Some of these
factors are beyond our control. Adjustments to the 2002 Veritas
facilities restructuring plan will be made if actual lease exit
costs or sublease income differ materially from amounts
currently expected.

In connection with the Veritas acquisition on July 2, 2005,
we recorded $7 million of restructuring costs, of which
$2 million related to excess facilities costs and
$5 million related to severance, associated benefits, and
outplacement services. These restructuring costs reflect the
termination of redundant employees and the



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

consolidation of certain facilities as a result of the Veritas
acquisition. In fiscal 2006, we paid $4 million related to
this reserve. We expect the remainder of the costs to be paid by
the end of fiscal 2012.

For information on the acquisition related costs incurred in
connection with the Veritas acquisition, see Note 3.

In connection with our other acquisitions in fiscal 2006, we
recorded $12 million of restructuring costs, of which
$8 million related to severance, associated benefits, and
outplacement services and $4 million related to excess
facilities costs. These restructuring costs reflect the
termination of redundant employees and the consolidation of
certain facilities as a result of our other acquisitions. In
fiscal 2006, we paid $3 million in connection with this
reserve. We expect the remainder of the costs to be paid by the
end of fiscal 2012.

Amounts related to acquisition-related restructuring are
reflected in the purchase price allocation of the applicable
acquisition.

Note 13.

Income Taxes

The components of the provision for income taxes are as follows:

Pretax income from international operations was
$451 million, $499 million, and $354 million for
fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

The difference between our effective income tax rate and the
federal statutory income tax rate as a percentage of income
before income taxes is as follows:



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

The principal components of deferred tax assets are as follows:

The valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets increased by
$59 million in fiscal 2006, of which approximately
$58 million is attributable to acquisition-related assets,
the benefit of which will reduce goodwill when and if realized.
The valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets increased by
an immaterial amount in fiscal 2005.

As of March 31, 2006, we have net operating loss
carryforwards attributable to various acquired companies of
approximately $485 million, which, if not used, will expire
between fiscal 2007 and 2025. These net operating loss
carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Internal
Revenue Code §382, but are expected to be fully realized.
In addition, we have foreign net operating loss carryforwards
attributable to various acquired foreign companies of
approximately $561 million, which, under current applicable
foreign tax law, can be carried forward indefinitely.

No provision has been made for federal or state income taxes on
$821 million of cumulative unremitted earnings of certain
of our foreign subsidiaries as of March 31, 2006, since we
plan to indefinitely reinvest these earnings. As of
March 31, 2006, the unrecognized deferred tax liability for
these earnings was $234 million.

In the March 2005 quarter, we repatriated $500 million from
certain of our foreign subsidiaries under provisions of the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the Jobs Act, enacted in
October 2004. We recorded a tax charge for this repatriation of
$54 million in the March 2005 quarter.

In May 2005, clarifying language was issued by the
U.S. Department of Treasury and the IRS with respect to the
treatment of foreign taxes paid on the earnings repatriated
under the Jobs Act and in September 2005, additional clarifying
language was issued regarding the treatment of certain
deductions attributable to the earnings repatriation. As a
result of this clarifying language, we reduced the tax expense
attributable to the repatriation by approximately
$21 million in fiscal 2006, which reduced the cumulative
tax charge on the repatriation to $33 million.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

The $500 million repatriation under the Jobs Act was deemed
to be distributed entirely from foreign earnings that had been
previously treated as indefinitely reinvested. However, this
distribution from previously indefinitely reinvested earnings
does not change our position going forward that future earnings
of certain of our foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely
reinvested.

On March 29, 2006, we received a Notice of Deficiency from
the IRS claiming that we owe additional taxes, plus interest and
penalties, for the 2000 and 2001 tax years based on an audit of
Veritas, which we acquired in July 2005. The incremental tax
liability asserted by the IRS with regard to the Veritas claim
is $867 million, excluding penalties and interest. The
Notice of Deficiency primarily relates to transfer pricing in
connection with a technology license agreement between Veritas
and a foreign subsidiary. We do not agree with the IRS position
and we intend to file a timely petition to the Tax Court to
protest the assessment. No payments will be made on the
assessment until the issue is definitively resolved. If, upon
resolution, we are required to pay an amount in excess of our
provision for this matter, the incremental amounts due would be
accounted for principally as additions to the cost of Veritas
purchase price. Any incremental interest accrued subsequent to
the date of the Veritas acquisition would be recorded as an
expense in the period the matter is resolved.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we made $90 million
of tax-related adjustments to the purchase accounting for
Veritas, consisting of $120 million of additional
pre-acquisition tax reserve-related adjustments, partially
offset by a $30 million reduction in other pre-acquisition
taxes payable. While we strongly disagree with the IRS over both
its transfer pricing methodologies and the amount of the
assessment, we have established additional tax reserves for all
Veritas pre-acquisition years to account for both contingent tax
and interest risk.

On March 30, 2006, we received notices of proposed
adjustment from the IRS with regard to an unrelated audit of
Symantec for fiscal years 2003 and 2004. The IRS claimed that we
owed an incremental tax liability with regard to this audit of
$110 million, excluding penalties and interest. The
incremental tax liability primarily relates to transfer pricing
matters between Symantec and a foreign subsidiary. For
information related to a proposed settlement of this IRS claim,
see Note 17.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we increased our tax
reserves by an additional $64 million in connection with
all open Symantec tax years (fiscal 2003 to 2006). Since these
reserves relate to licensing arising from acquired technology,
the additional accruals are primarily offset by deferred taxes.

We are as yet unable to confirm our eligibility to claim a lower
tax rate on a distribution made from a Veritas foreign
subsidiary prior to the acquisition. The distribution was
intended to be made pursuant to the Jobs Act, and therefore
eligible for a 5.25% effective U.S. federal rate of tax, in
lieu of the 35% statutory rate. We are seeking a ruling from the
IRS on the matter. Because we were unable to obtain this ruling
prior to filing the Veritas tax return in May 2006, we have paid
$130 million of additional U.S. taxes. Since this
payment relates to the taxability of foreign earnings that are
otherwise the subject of the IRS assessment, this additional
payment reduced the amount of taxes payable accrued as part of
the purchase accounting for pre-acquisition contingent tax risks.

Note 14.

Litigation

As described more fully in Note 13 above, we intend to file
a petition with the U.S. Tax Court prior to the end of June
2006, protesting an IRS claim for incremental taxes of
$867 million relating to transfer pricing in connection
with a technology license agreement between Veritas and a
foreign subsidiary.

Since the September quarter of 2002, Veritas has received
subpoenas issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or
SEC, in the investigation entitled

In the Matter of AOL/ Time
Warner.

The SEC has requested information regarding
transactions with AOL Time Warner, or AOL, and related
accounting and disclosure matters. Veritas’ transactions
with AOL, entered into in September 2000, involved a software
and services purchase by AOL at a stated value of
$50 million and the purchase by Veritas of advertising



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

services from AOL at a stated value of $20 million. In
March 2003, Veritas restated its financial statements for 2001
and 2000 to reflect a reduction in revenues and expenses of
$20 million, as well as an additional reduction in revenues
and expenses of $1 million related to two other
contemporaneous transactions with other parties in 2000 that
involved software licenses and the purchase of online
advertising services. In March 2005, the SEC charged AOL with
securities fraud pursuant to a complaint entitled

Securities
and Exchange Commission v. Time Warner, Inc.

In its
complaint, the SEC described certain transactions between AOL
and a “California-based software company that creates and
licenses data storage software” that appear to reference
Veritas’ transactions with AOL as described above, and
alleged that AOL aided and abetted that California-based
software company in violating Section 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act
Rule

10b-5.

In March 2004, Veritas announced its intention to restate its
financial statements for 2002 and 2001 and to revise previously
announced financial results for 2003. The decision resulted from
the findings of an investigation into past accounting practices
that concluded on March 12, 2004. In the first quarter of
2004, Veritas voluntarily disclosed to the staff of the SEC past
accounting practices applicable to its 2002 and 2001 financial
statements that were not in compliance with GAAP. In June 2004,
Veritas restated its financial statements for 2002 and 2001 and
reported revised financial results for 2003.

Prior to our acquisition of Veritas, Veritas had been in
discussions with the staff of the SEC regarding the SEC’s
review of these matters and, based on communications with the
staff, Veritas expected these discussions to result in a
settlement with the SEC in which we would be required to pay a
$30 million penalty. We would be unable to deduct the
$30 million penalty for income tax purposes, be reimbursed
or indemnified for such payment through insurance or any other
source, or use the payment to setoff or reduce any award of
compensatory damages to plaintiffs in related securities
litigation. Final settlement with the SEC is subject to
agreement on final terms and documentation, approval by
Symantec’s board of directors, and approval by the SEC
Commissioners. In the March quarter of 2005, Veritas recorded a
charge of $30 million in its consolidated statement of
operations, and a corresponding accrual in its balance sheet. As
of the filing of this annual report, the terms of the final
settlement are still under consideration by the SEC
Commissioners, and have not been approved. As part of our
accounting for the acquisition of Veritas, we recorded the
accrual of $30 million in Other accrued expenses in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. We intend to cooperate with the SEC
in its investigation and review of the foregoing matters.

On August 2, 2004, Veritas received a copy of an amended
complaint in

Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP v. AOL Time
Warner, et. al.

in which Veritas was named as a defendant.
The case was originally filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York in July 2003 against
Time Warner (formerly, AOL Time Warner), current and former
officers and directors of Time Warner and AOL, and Time
Warner’s outside auditor, Ernst & Young LLP. The
plaintiff alleges that Veritas aided and abetted AOL in alleged
common law fraud and also alleges that it engaged in common law
fraud as part of a civil conspiracy. The plaintiff seeks an
unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages. On
March 17, 2006, the parties entered into a Settlement
Agreement and Mutual Release resolving all claims in the
lawsuit. This action was dismissed by the Court with prejudice
on May 31, 2006.

On July 7, 2004, a purported class action complaint
entitled

Paul Kuck, et al. v. Veritas Software
Corporation, et al.

was filed in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware. The lawsuit alleges
violations of federal securities laws in connection with
Veritas’ announcement on July 6, 2004 that it expected
results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended June 30,
2004 to fall below earlier estimates. The complaint generally
seeks an unspecified amount of damages. Subsequently, additional
purported class action complaints have been filed in Delaware
federal court, and, on March 3, 2005, the Court entered an
order consolidating these actions and appointing lead plaintiffs
and counsel. A consolidated amended complaint, or CAC, was filed
on May 27, 2005, expanding the class period from
April 23, 2004 through July 6, 2004. The CAC also
named another officer as a defendant and added allegations that
Veritas and the named officers made false or misleading
statements in the company’s press releases and SEC filings
regarding the company’s



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

financial results, which allegedly contained revenue recognized
from contracts that were unsigned or lacked essential terms. The
defendants to this matter filed a motion to dismiss the CAC in
July 2005; the motion was denied in May 2006. The defendants to
this matter intend to defend this case vigorously.

We are also involved in a number of other judicial and
administrative proceedings that are incidental to our business.
Although adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur in one or
more of the cases, it is not possible to estimate the possible
loss or losses from each of these cases. The final resolution of
these lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, is not
expected to have a material adverse affect on our financial
condition or results of operations. We have accrued estimated
legal fees and expenses related to certain of these matters;
however, actual amounts may differ materially from those
estimated amounts.

Note 15.

Segment Information

Our operating segments are significant strategic business units
that offer different products and services, distinguished by
customer needs. As of March 31, 2006, we operated in six
operating segments:

In the quarter ended September 2005, we renamed the Enterprise
Administration segment to be the Storage and Server Management
segment and added the Data Protection segment. In the quarter
ended June 2005, we moved Managed Security Services from the
Services segment to the Enterprise Security segment and moved
the services-related revenue previously included in the Storage
and Server Management segment to the Services segment. Net
revenues for fiscal 2005 and 2004 have been reclassified to
conform to our current presentation. Specifically, we
reclassified $31 million and $27 million of Managed
Security Services revenue from the Services segment to the
Enterprise Security segment and $5 million and an
insignificant amount of services-related revenue from the
Storage and Server Management segment to the Services segment
for fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

Beginning in the June 2006 quarter, we will consolidate our
Enterprise Security, Data Protection, and Storage and Server
Management segments into two segments — the Security
and Data Management segment and the Data Center Management
segment.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting policies,
with the exception of the amortization of acquired product
rights, which is included entirely in our Other segment. There
are no intersegment sales. Our chief operating decision maker
evaluates performance based on direct profit or loss from
operations before income taxes not including nonrecurring gains
and losses, foreign exchange gains and losses, and miscellaneous
other income and expenses. The majority of our assets and
liabilities are not discretely allocated or reviewed by segment.
The depreciation and amortization of our property, equipment,
and leasehold improvements are allocated based on headcount,
unless specifically identified by segment.

Segment information

The following table presents a summary of our operating segments:


Net revenues for fiscal 2005 and 2004 have been reclassified to
    conform to current presentation. Specifically, we reclassified
    $31 million and $27 million of Managed Security
    Services revenue from the Services segment to the Enterprise
    Security segment and $5 million and an insignificant amount
    of services-related revenue from the Storage and Server
    Management segment to the Services segment for fiscal 2005 and
    2004, respectively.

Product revenue information

Net revenues from sales of our antivirus products within our
Consumer Products and Enterprise Security segments represented
34%, 55%, and 58% of our total net revenues for fiscal 2006,
2005, and 2004, respectively. Net revenues from sales of our
Norton Internet security product within our Consumer Products
segment represented 15%, 18%, and 12% of our total net revenues
during fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Net revenues
from sales of our storage and server management products within
our Storage and Server Management segment represented 12% of our
total revenues during fiscal 2006.

Note 16.

Cumulative Adjustment to Net Revenues and Deferred Revenue

In August 2004, during a review of our revenue maintenance
application used to calculate the amount of deferred revenue for
our consumer products, we discovered an error in the unit
renewal prices manually entered into the application. The unit
renewal prices used to calculate the deferred revenue did not
reflect the correct subscription renewal prices for foreign
currency sales, which serves as the basis for our deferral. As a
result, the deferred revenue from these consumer products was
understated and the portion of revenue from these products that
was recognized at the time of sale was overstated. The
cumulative overstatement of revenue for periods prior to the
three months ended June 30, 2004 totaled approximately
$20 million. The effect of the error was not material to
any prior period. To correct this error, we recorded the
cumulative $20 million as a reduction in Net revenues in
the Consolidated Statements of Income and a corresponding
$20 million increase in Current deferred revenue in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets during the three-month period ended
June 2004. Substantially all of the $20 million of current
deferred revenue was recognized as revenue during fiscal 2005.

Subsequent Events

In April 2006, we purchased two buildings in Cupertino,
California, for a total purchase price of $81 million.
These buildings are currently leased to a third party.

From April 1 through May 31, 2006, we repurchased
8.2 million shares at prices ranging from $15.93 to
$17.74 per share for an aggregate amount of
$136 million. As of May 31, 2006, $710 million
remained authorized for future repurchases.

On March 30, 2006, we received notices of proposed
adjustment from the IRS with regard to an audit of Symantec for
fiscal years 2003 and 2004. The IRS claimed that we owed an
incremental tax liability with regard to this audit of
$110 million, excluding penalties and interest. The
incremental tax liability primarily relates to transfer pricing
matters between Symantec and a foreign subsidiary. On
June 2, 2006, we reached an agreement in principle with the
IRS to settle the IRS claims relating to this audit for
$36 million, excluding interest. The consolidated financial
statements presented in this annual report reflect adequate
accruals to address this settlement amount. We anticipate that
we will finalize this settlement with the IRS before the end of
June 2006. For further discussion, see Note 13.
