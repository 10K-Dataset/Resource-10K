BUSINESS OVERVIEW

We currently view our business in five operating segments: Enterprise
Security, Enterprise Administration, Consumer Products, Services and Other. For
financial information related to our operating segments, see Note 16 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form

10-K.

Enterprise Security

Our Enterprise Security segment focuses on providing Internet security
technology, global response and services necessary for organizations to manage
their information security needs. Our comprehensive solutions offer products to
protect gateways, servers, and clients (desktop PCs, laptops, mobile devices
and PDAs) with virus protection and filtering, firewall security and virtual
private networking, or VPN, intrusion detection, and security management. In
addition, we have expanded our technology offerings to include integrated
solutions at the gateway and client levels, combining several of our individual
technology solutions, and early warning solutions. At the gateway level, our
products run on Windows NT ®, Solaris®, and Linux® platforms. Our
products at the server level operate on Windows NT, UNIX, Linux and other key
server platforms. At the client level, our products run on the Windows®



platform. Our Enterprise Security segment represented approximately 42%, 42%
and 33% of net revenues during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Virus Protection and Filtering

Our virus protection and filtering technologies combine multi-tier protection
against viruses with the management of Internet communications for sensitive
content or misuse of data. Users of our virus protection and filtering products
are able to take action to protect their enterprise from risks associated with
using Internet resources. This includes scanning or monitoring data that
enters, leaves or travels inside the organization, as well as detecting and
eliminating malicious code that may be introduced into a company’s network. Our
virus protection and e-mail and Internet content filtering technologies protect
gateways, servers and clients at multiple entry points from known and unknown
threats. Products and services providing protection from virus attacks
represent the most well-known and largest market component of the enterprise

security area.

Symantec AntiVirus™

offers the flexibility of a bundled, multi-tiered
antivirus solution to protect the enterprise’s network, including Internet
gateways, desktops, file and print servers, mail servers and firewalls.
Symantec AntiVirus also enables corporations to keep their virus definitions up
to date by automatically downloading virus definitions through LiveUpdate™,
created by Symantec™ Security Response.

Symantec AntiVirus™

Scan Engine provides fast, scalable, and reliable virus
protection for traffic served through, or stored on, network infrastructure
devices.

Firewalls/VPNs

Firewalls provide protection against unwanted intrusion while enabling the flow
of approved traffic. VPN solutions are designed to enable employees and
business partners to remotely access an enterprise network in a secure, cost
effective manner. We offer firewall and VPN solutions that protect throughout
the network, including at Internet gateways, gateways to sensitive internal
networks and at client devices.

Symantec™ Enterprise Firewall

, a gateway software firewall product, protects
enterprise assets and business transactions. As a comprehensive full inspection
firewall, Symantec Enterprise Firewall enables fast, but controlled

Security Management

At the gateway and server level, our policy compliance management products find
system vulnerabilities and help to ensure security policy compliance to
proactively reduce business risk. The initial step to reduce corporate risk is
to effectively measure compliance to a business’ security policy and detect
vulnerabilities where critical information resides. It is important to
understand the effectiveness of a security policy in order to properly define,
manage and enforce business policies and assess possible threats.

SALES AND MARKETING

In addition to our direct sales force, we license our enterprise and consumer
products through our distributor, corporate reseller, value-added reseller and
system integrator channels.

We sell our consumer products to individuals and small offices/home offices
around the world through a multi-tiered distribution network. Our products are
available to customers through channels that include: distributors, retailers,
direct marketers, Internet-based resellers or “e-tailers,” original equipment
manufacturers, educational institutions and Internet service providers. We also
sell some of our products and product upgrades through direct mail/e-mail and
over the Internet, in conjunction with channel partners.

We maintain distribution relationships with major independent distributors. Our
indirect sales force works closely with our major distributor and reseller
accounts to manage the flow of orders, inventory levels and sales to customers.
We also work closely with them to execute channel marketing promotions and
other cooperative marketing activities.

Our agreements with distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be
terminated by either party at any time without cause. These distributors are
not within our control and are not obligated to purchase products from us. They
also distribute other vendors’ product lines.

Distributors that accounted for more than 10% of net revenues included Ingram
Micro Inc. (26%, 23% and 26% during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively)
and Tech Data Group (15% and 11% during fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively).

Our marketing activities include:

For our consumer products, we typically offer two types of rebate programs
within most countries: volume incentive rebates to channel partners and
promotional rebates to end-users. The distributor or reseller earns a volume
incentive rebate primarily based upon their sale of products to end-users. From
time to time, we also make rebates available to individual users of various
products acquired through major retailers. We regularly offer upgrade rebates
to existing customers purchasing a new version of a product. Both volume
incentive rebates and end-user rebates are accrued as an offset to revenue when
revenue is originally recorded.

INTERNATIONAL SALES

Revenues from sales outside of the United States represented approximately 49%,
47% and 48% of our net revenues during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Our international revenues consisted of sales primarily in the
Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, region and sales from these regions
collectively represented approximately 30%, 27% and 27% of our net revenues
during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Additional financial
information regarding our international sales is provided in Note 16 to Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The majority of our net revenues from EMEA are derived from sales by affiliates
of our major United States distributors. Additionally, we sell our products
through authorized distributors, which may be restricted to specified
territories. For most of our consumer products, we translate the documentation,
software and packaging into the local language and prepare marketing programs
for each local market.

We have marketing offices in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada,
China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary,
India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the



Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South
Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and the
United Kingdom. These local offices facilitate our marketing and distribution
in international markets. Our international operations are subject to various
risks common to international operations, including but not restricted to:

engineers, virus hunters and global technical support teams that work in tandem
to provide extensive coverage for enterprises and consumers. Symantec Security
Response provides customers with comprehensive, global, 24x7 Internet security
expertise to guard against today’s blended Internet threats, which are threats
that are multi-faceted in their operating methods and effects.

Symantec Security Response addresses blended threats by providing a thorough
analysis of Internet security threats, evaluating how threats work together,
then offering recommendations on protection. This allows us to respond to
complex security threats in a more holistic, preventive manner. A Symantec

Symantec Security Response not only provides time-sensitive security advisories
using web updates, but also provides alerting services, technical support and
media alerts. Symantec Security Response is committed to educating the general
public about key security threats and trends through published white papers and
speaking engagements worldwide.

Research Centers

The research centers for Symantec Security Response are focused on collecting
and analyzing the latest malware threats, from network security threats and
vulnerabilities to viruses and worms. When a new threat or vulnerability is
discovered, Symantec Security Response experts provide rapid emergency
response, focusing on communication with customers and delivery of security
updates for our security products. Research centers are located around the
world, including the United States, Asia Pacific, Australia and Europe.

To ensure that customers are utilizing the most recent technologies available

including Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin,
Portuguese and Spanish.

Enterprise Security Support

Our enterprise security support program offers annual support contracts to all
enterprise customers worldwide. Our standard annual support contracts provide
1) unlimited hot-line service delivered by telephone, fax, e-mail and over the
Internet; 2) immediate patches for severe problems; 3) periodic software
updates; 4) access to our technical knowledge base and FAQ facility; and 5) an
invitation to the annual user group meeting. Inclusive in these standard



annual
support contracts are virus definitions and intrusion detection signatures
created by Symantec Security Response. Customers may augment their standard
annual support contract with services such as 24x7 telephone and web support,
advanced alerting services, additional designated callers (contacts) and
additional language support, as well as a Technical Account Manager, assigned
to work closely with an organization and act as a focal point for all issues.

Consumer Product Support

Our consumer product support program provides free self-help online services to
all consumer customers worldwide, as well as free e-mail support. A team of
product experts, editors and language translators are dedicated to maintaining
the robustness of the online knowledge base. Generally, telephone product
support is provided for a fee. For customers that subscribe to them, the latest
virus definitions and application bug fixes and/or patches for most of our
currently marketed and developed products are downloaded automatically through
LiveUpdate, created by Symantec Security Response.

We revise these fee-based support programs from time to time as customer
requirements change and as market trends dictate. These programs may vary
slightly by region.

RECENT ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

Acquisitions

Since our initial public offering on June 23, 1989, we have completed
acquisitions of 29 businesses.

Our recent acquisitions included:

•

Riptech, Inc., Recourse Technologies, Inc., SecurityFocus Inc., and
Mountain Wave, Inc. in the September 2002 quarter;

•

Lindner & Pelc Consult GmbH and Foster-Melliar Limited’s enterprise
security management division in the September 2001 quarter; and

•

AXENT Technologies, Inc. in the December 2000 quarter.

We accounted for each of these acquisitions as a purchase and, accordingly, we
have included the operating results of these businesses in our consolidated
financial statements subsequent to their respective dates of acquisition. See
Note 3 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion
of the above acquisitions. We also have acquired several other businesses in
the past, including Peter Norton Computing, Inc. on August 31, 1990. We
continue to use the Norton brand name for certain consumer products developed
and marketed by us.

In April 2003, we purchased certain assets related to Roxio Inc.’s
GoBack computer recovery software business. In addition, we
entered into an agreement in May 2003 to acquire Nexland, Inc., a technology
driven Internet security company whose Internet Protocol based networking
appliances are installed at enterprise branches and telecommuter offices
worldwide.

Divestitures

We divested our web access management product line on August 24, 2001. We have
included the operating results of this product line prior to disposition in our
Other segment.

For further discussion on our recent acquisitions and divestitures, see Note
3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PARTNERSHIPS, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS

We use a multiple product sourcing strategy that includes:

•

internal development;

•

licensing from third parties;

•

investment in companies; and

•

acquisitions of technologies, product lines or companies.

We develop software products that are designed to operate on a variety of
operating systems. We typically develop new products and enhancements of
existing products through focused product development groups. Each product
development group is responsible for its own design, development, documentation
and quality assurance. Our research and development expenditures for each of
the last three years are further discussed under “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Research and
Development Expenses”.



Independent contractors are used for aspects of the product development
process. In addition, elements of some of our products are licensed from third
parties.

We invest in companies with emerging technologies and companies that promote
the sale and use of our products and services. These investments are made in
lieu of an acquisition when timing is inappropriate or when the business models
and sectors fall out of our strategic requirements. We pursue investments which
we believe will be complementary and can enhance both financial returns and
market growth.

We use strategic acquisitions as necessary to provide certain technology,
people and products for our overall product and services strategy. We consider
both timeliness to market and potential market share growth when evaluating
acquisitions of technologies, product lines or companies. We have completed a
number of acquisitions of technologies, companies and products in the past, and
have also disposed of technologies and products. We may acquire and/or dispose
of other technologies, companies and products in the future. For further
discussion on our acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 3 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

COMPETITION

Our markets are intensely competitive and are subject to rapid changes in
technology. They are influenced by the constant change in Internet security
threats and the strategic direction of major software and operating system
providers, network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers, Internet
service providers, application service providers and key application software
vendors. Our competitiveness depends on our ability to deliver products that
meet our customers’ needs by enhancing our existing solutions and services and
offering reliable, scalable and standardized new solutions on a timely basis.
We have limited resources, and as a result, we must deploy our available
resources thoughtfully. The principal competitive factors in our Enterprise
Security and Administration and Consumer Products segments are quality,
employment of the most advanced technology, time to market, price, reputation,
financial stability, breadth of product offerings, customer support, brand
recognition, and sales and marketing teams. In our Services segment, the
principal competitive factors include technical capability, customer
responsiveness, price, ability to attract and retain talented and experienced
personnel, financial stability, and reputation within the industry.

In the enterprise security and administration market, we compete against many
companies who offer competing products to our technology solutions and
competing services to our response and support. In the area of antivirus and
filtering products, some of the companies we compete against are Computer
Associates, Network Associates, Sophos, Trend Micro, and WebSense. In addition,
Microsoft has announced its intent to sell stand-alone antivirus products. In
the area of firewall and VPN, some of the companies we compete against are
Checkpoint, Cisco, NetScreen, SonicWALL and Watchguard. In the area of
intrusion detection and security management, some of the companies we compete
against are Bindview, Internet Security Services and NetIQ. In the area of
remote management and cloning, some of the companies we compete against are
Altiris, Laplink and PowerQuest. In addition, we face indirect or potential
competition from operating system providers and network equipment and computer
hardware manufacturers, who provide or may provide various security solutions
and functions in their current and future products. These competitors have
significant advantages due to their ability to influence or control the
computing platforms, security layers and network tiers on or in which security
products operate. In addition, these competitors generally have significantly
greater financial, marketing or technological resources than we do. We believe
that our ability to compete in the enterprise security and administration
market going forward depends in part on providing simplified, solution-oriented
offerings that address multiple aspects of enterprise security.

Some of the companies that offer competing products to our Consumer Products
offerings include Internet Security Services, Kroll, Network Associates,
Norman, Panda, Trend Micro and ZoneLabs. With the recent outbreaks of viruses
and other Internet-based security threats, several other companies have entered
the market and may become significant competitors in the future.

Our Enterprise Security Services compete with companies such as Counterpane,
IBM, Internet Security Services and Ubizen.

Price competition is intense with most of our products and services. We expect
price competition to continue to increase and become even more significant in
the future, which may reduce our profit margins.

We also face competition from a number of other products that offer levels of
functionality different from those offered by our products, or that were
designed for a somewhat different group of end-users than those targeted by us.
Microsoft has added security features to new versions of its operating system
products that provide some of the same functions offered in our products, and
has recently announced the acquisition of antivirus technology, which
creates the possibility that it will



include antivirus functions in future
versions of its operating system products. In addition,
vendors of other operating systems, such as Red Hat® Linux, Solaris and
Unix-based operating systems, may also incorporate some of the advanced
utilities or other functionality offered in our products. While we plan to
continue to improve our products with a view toward providing enhanced
functionality over that provided in current and future operating systems, these
efforts may be unsuccessful and any improved products may not be commercially
accepted by users. We will also continue to attempt to cooperate with operating
system vendors to make our products compatible with those operating systems,
while at the same time, differentiating our utility products from features
included in those operating systems. Our efforts in this regard may be
unsuccessful.

The demand for some of our products, including those currently under
development, may decrease if, among other reasons:

•

Microsoft includes additional product features in future releases
of Windows;

•

hardware vendors, including Cisco, incorporate additional
server-based network management and security tools into network
operating systems; or

•

Microsoft, network equipment or
computer hardware manufacturers
license products from our competitors for inclusion in their operating
systems or products or develop or acquire technology or products that
provide functionality directly competitive with our product and service
offerings.

In addition, we compete with other computer software companies, operating
system providers and network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers for
access to retail distribution channels and for the attention of customers at
the retail level and in corporate accounts. We also compete with other software
companies, operating system providers and network equipment and computer
hardware manufacturers to acquire products or companies and to publish software
developed by third parties.

Some of our existing and potential competitors have greater financial,
marketing or technological resources than we do. We believe that competition in
the industry will continue to intensify as other major software companies
expand their product lines into additional product categories, and as operating
system providers and network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers
attempt to leverage their strengths at the computing platform, security layer
and network tier to compete more aggressively in the market for security
solutions.

MANUFACTURING

Our product development groups produce a set of master CD-ROMs or diskettes and
documentation for each product that are then duplicated or replicated and
packaged into products by our logistics organization. Purchasing of all raw
materials is done by Symantec personnel in our Cupertino, California and
Dublin, Ireland facilities for products manufactured in those areas. All of our
domestic manufacturing and order fulfillment is performed by an outside
contractor under the supervision of our domestic logistics organization. The
manufacturing steps that are subcontracted to outside organizations include the
replication of CD-ROMs, printing of documentation materials and retail boxes,
and assembly of the final packages. For most products distributed outside of
North and South America, our Dublin, Ireland manufacturing facility performs
diskette duplication, assembly of the final packages, and order fulfillment.
Our Dublin, Ireland manufacturing facility also subcontracts to outside
organizations for the replication of CD-ROMs and printing of documentation
materials and retail boxes.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We regard our software as proprietary. We attempt to protect our software
technology by relying on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret and
trademark laws, restrictions on disclosure and other methods. In particular, we
have a substantial number of registered trademarks and currently hold a
substantial number of patents in the United States, as well as patent holdings
in other countries, that expire at various times over the next twenty years. We
have also filed several other applications for patents and trademarks in order
to protect proprietary intellectual property that we believe are important to
our business. We also license some intellectual property from third parties for
use in our products.

We face a number of risks relating to our intellectual property, including
unauthorized use and unauthorized copying or “piracy” of our software
solutions. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property
rights, to protect trade secrets or trademarks or to determine the validity and
scope of the proprietary rights of others. Patents that have been issued to us
could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against
competitive products in every jurisdiction. Furthermore, other parties have
asserted and may, in the future, assert infringement claims against us. For
further discussion on our current litigation, see Note 15 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. These claims and any
litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights.



Litigation,
even if not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of
resources and management attention. In addition, third party licenses may not
continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.

EMPLOYEES

As of March 31, 2003, we employed approximately 4,300 people worldwide,
including approximately 2,200 in sales, marketing and related staff activities
(with over 600 employees in our direct sales force), 1,100 in product
development, 200 in services and 800 in management, manufacturing,
administration and finance. In connection with the relocation of our Leiden,
Netherlands operations to Dublin, Ireland in early fiscal year 2003, a group of
employees in the Leiden facility joined a union to negotiate the proposed terms
of the transfer of operations to our Dublin facility, focusing primarily on
severance benefits for employees that do not relocate to Dublin. Except for
these terminated employees, no other employees are represented by a labor
union. We believe that relations with our employees are good.

Statement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we include non-GAAP financial results
in our earnings press releases and presentations to investors. Our non-GAAP net
income and earnings per share presentations generally exclude acquisition
related charges, such as acquired in-process research and development and
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles, and certain other charges, such
as restructurings and site closures, as well as the tax effects of these items.
Our management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because
they provide supplemental information that facilitates comparisons to prior
periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate its financial
results, develop budgets and manage expenditures. These non-GAAP measures may
differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies and should not be
regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures.



Item 7:

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

OVERVIEW

Symantec provides a broad range of content and network security software and
appliance solutions to enterprises, individuals and service providers. We are a
leading provider of client, gateway and server security solutions for virus
protection, firewall and virtual private network, security management,
intrusion detection, Internet content and e-mail filtering, remote management
technologies and security services to enterprises and service providers around
the world. Founded in 1982, we have offices in 36 countries worldwide.

We have a 52/53-week fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references as of
and for the periods ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 reflect amounts as of
and for the periods ended March 28, 2003, March 29, 2002 and March 30, 2001,
respectively. The fiscal accounting years ended March 28, 2003, March 29, 2002
and March 30, 2001 each comprised 52 weeks of operations. The fiscal accounting
year ending April 2, 2004 will comprise of 53 weeks of operations, with the
extra week coming in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.

Revenue Recognition

We derive revenue primarily from sales of packaged software products, perpetual
software license agreements, product maintenance and services, and recognize
this revenue in accordance with Statement of Position, or SOP, 97-2,

Software
Revenue Recognition,

as modified by SOP 98-9, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
101,

Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements

, when the following conditions
have been met:

We sell packaged products, which primarily include consumer products, through a
multi-tiered distribution channel. We defer revenue on all distribution and
reseller channel inventory in excess of specified inventory levels in these
channels. We defer a portion of revenue for product bundled with content
updates. This deferred revenue is recognized ratably over the initial year that
such updates are provided. We offer the right of return of our products under
various policies and programs with our distributors, resellers and end-user
customers. We estimate and record reserves for end-user product returns and
channel and end-user rebates, and we account for these reserves as an offset to
revenue.

We enter into perpetual software license agreements mainly for our enterprise
security and enterprise administration products primarily through indirect
sales with distributors and resellers. The license agreements generally include
product maintenance agreements, for which the related revenue is deferred and
recognized ratably over the period of the agreements.

Our services include managed security services, consulting and education. We
recognize managed security services revenue ratably over the period that such
contracted services are provided. We recognize consulting services revenue as
services are performed or upon written acceptance from customers, if
applicable. We recognize education services revenue as services are performed.

In arrangements that include perpetual software licenses and maintenance and/or
services, and packaged products with content updates (“multiple elements”), we
allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor-specific
objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered elements, and
recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount
deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. Our deferred revenue consists
primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance and
consumer product content updates.

VSOE of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is
sold separately. We determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on
historical evidence of our stand-alone sales of these elements to third
parties. If VSOE does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance or
services, then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the
performance period.



Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make estimates,
assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported
amounts of net revenue, operating income and net income (loss), as well as on
the value of certain assets on our consolidated balance sheet. We believe that
the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies
described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated
financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting
policies. See “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” beginning on page 50
in the consolidated financial statements for more information about these
critical accounting policies, as well as descriptions of other significant
accounting policies. We have engaged in discussions with our audit committee of
the Board of Directors regarding the development, selection and disclosure of
our critical accounting policies.

Channel Revenue Deferrals

We defer revenue relating to products, primarily in our Consumer and Enterprise
Administration segments, that we have shipped into our distribution and
reseller channels to the extent that inventory levels are in excess of certain
specified inventory levels for these channels. We defer this revenue as an
offset to accounts receivable. We estimate the excess inventory in these
channels by analyzing channel inventory levels and distribution sell-through
trends obtained from our channel partners, as well as various historical trends
on a product basis. In addition, we consider other factors in assessing these
specified inventory levels, such as product seasonality, current market
conditions, economic trends, existing security threats and timing of new
product releases. On the same basis, we defer the associated cost of revenues
related to the channel revenue deferral. If we made different judgments or
utilized different estimates, material differences may result in the amount and
timing of our net revenues and cost of revenues for any period presented.

Reserves for Product Returns

End-users may return our products, primarily within our Consumer and Enterprise
Administration segments, through distributors and resellers or to us directly
for a full refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase.
Our estimated reserves for such end-user product returns, which are recorded as
an offset to revenue, are based primarily on historical trends. Our return
policy allows distributors and resellers, subject to certain contractual
limitations, to return purchased products in exchange for new products or for
credit towards future purchases. Product returns by distributors and resellers
principally relate to stock balancing and the replacement of obsolete products.
Channel revenue deferrals, as discussed above, are designed to take into
account any distributor and reseller stock balancing returns. In addition, we
fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels. We also
consider other factors such as the timing of upgrades and new versions of
products, current market conditions, economic trends and changes in technology.
If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates, material
differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any
period presented.

Reserves for Rebates

We estimate and record reserves as an offset to revenue for channel and
end-user rebates, related primarily to products within our Enterprise Security,
Enterprise Administration and Consumer segments. Our estimated reserves for
channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and resellers’
actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate
programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our reserves for end-user
rebates are estimated on the terms and conditions of the promotional program,
actual sales during the promotion, amount of actual redemptions received,
historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program and
the value of the rebate. We also consider current market conditions and
economic trends when estimating our reserve for rebates. If we made different
judgments or utilized different estimates, material differences may result in
the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potential
uncollectible trade receivables. We
review our trade receivables by aging category to identify specific customers
with known disputes or collectibility issues. We exercise judgment when
determining the adequacy of these reserves as we evaluate historical bad debt
trends, general economic conditions in the U.S. and internationally, and
changes in customer financial conditions. If we made different judgments or
utilized different estimates, material differences may result in additional
reserves for trade receivables, which would be reflected by charges in general
and administrative expenses for any period presented.

Impairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill

We evaluate goodwill for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial
Standards, or SFAS, No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

, which requires
that goodwill no longer be amortized and that goodwill be tested for



impairment
annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant. We performed
the initial goodwill impairment test required by SFAS No. 142 during the June
2002 quarter. We identified four reporting units, which represent our primary
operating segments (see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements of this Form 10-K), and determined that there was no impairment of
goodwill recorded upon implementation of SFAS No. 142. We completed our annual
goodwill impairment test during the March 2003 quarter and determined that
there was no impairment of goodwill. We will continue to test for impairment
during the fourth quarter of each year, or earlier if indicators of impairment
exist.

We also evaluate long-lived and intangible assets, including property,
equipment, leasehold improvements and acquired product rights, for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when
the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the
use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount.
Such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying
amount of the asset and its fair value. Significant judgment is required in the
forecasting of future operating results, which are used in the preparation of
projected cash flows. If we made different judgments or utilized different
estimates, material differences may result in write-downs of net long-lived and
intangible assets, which would be reflected by charges to our operating results
for any period presented.

Restructuring and Site Closures

During fiscal 2003 and 2002, we incurred expenses related to consolidating,
moving and relocating various groups or sites. In determining the charge
related to our excess facilities, certain estimates were used, such as the
ability to sublease the facilities, the terms of future subleases, broker
commissions, costs of tenant improvements and related exit costs. In developing
our estimates, we obtained information from third party leasing agents to
calculate anticipated third party sublease income and the vacancy period prior
to finding a sub-leasee. Market conditions will affect our ability to sublease
facilities on terms consistent with our estimates. Our ability to sublease
facilities ahead of schedule or the negotiation of lease terms resulting in
higher or lower sublease income than estimated will affect our accrual and the
related charge for restructuring, site closures and other expenses. Differences
between estimates of related broker commissions, tenant improvements and
related exit costs may increase or decrease our accrual upon final negotiation.
If we employed different assumptions regarding these various components of our
exit costs, the costs recorded for any period presented could vary materially
from those actually recorded.

Deferred Income Taxes

On a quarterly basis we evaluate our deferred tax asset balance for
realizability. To the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, we will
establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. Realization of
our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future U.S. taxable income and future
taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as our implementation
of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Our judgments regarding future
profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or
international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require
possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a
reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such
determinations are made.

Recent Events

During the September 2002 quarter, we acquired the following four
privately-held companies for approximately $375.2 million in cash:

Riptech, Inc., a provider of scalable, real-time managed security
services that protect clients through advanced outsourced security
monitoring and professional services.

Recourse Technologies, Inc., a provider of security threat management
solutions that detect, analyze and respond to both known and novel
threats, including intrusions, internal attacks and denial of service
attacks.

SecurityFocus Inc., a provider of enterprise security threat management
systems, providing global early warning of cyber attacks, customized and
comprehensive threat alerts, and countermeasures to prevent attacks
before they occur.

Mountain Wave, Inc., a provider of automated attack sensing and warning
software and services for real-time enterprise security operations
management.

As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded, as adjusted for revised
estimates related to certain liabilities, approximately $4.7 million for
acquired in-process research and development, $40.5 million for developed
technology and acquired product rights, $307.5 million for goodwill, $4.3
million for other intangibles, $19.3 million



for net deferred tax assets and
$7.6 million for tangible assets, net of liabilities. See Note 3 to the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the above
acquisitions.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following table sets forth each item from our consolidated statements of
operations as a percentage of net revenues and the percentage change in the
total amount of each item for the periods indicated.

*     Percentage change is not meaningful.

Net Revenues

Net revenues increased 31% to approximately $1.4 billion during fiscal 2003
from $1.1 billion during fiscal 2002 and 26% to $1.1 billion during fiscal 2002
from $853.6 million during fiscal 2001. The increase during fiscal 2003 as
compared to fiscal 2002 was due primarily to increased sales of our consumer
products and enterprise security products. The increased sales of our consumer
products and enterprise security products was largely attributable to
continuing growth in demand for our virus protection solutions from large
organizations as well as from small businesses and consumers. From a regional
standpoint, the increase was primarily due to growth in net revenues
internationally and, to a lesser extent, in the United States. Strength in
major foreign currencies during fiscal 2003 also positively impacted our
international revenue growth.

The increase during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was due primarily to
increased sales of our enterprise security products and a significant increase
in sales of our consumer products during the second half of fiscal 2002. The
increase in enterprise security products during fiscal 2002 was attributable to
a full year of sales related to



AXENT solutions as compared to approximately
three months during fiscal 2001. From a regional standpoint, this increase was
primarily due to growth in net revenues in the United States and to a lesser
extent in EMEA.

A significant portion of our deferred revenue balance of $331.1 million as of
March 31, 2002 contributed to our total net revenues during fiscal 2003. We
anticipate that our deferred revenue balance of $589.6 million as of March 31,
2003, will also be a significant portion of our net revenues during the first
quarter of fiscal 2004.

Our Enterprise Security segment provides organizations with Internet security
technology, global response and services to manage their information security
needs. Our Enterprise Security segment represented approximately 42%, 42% and
33% of net revenues during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net
revenues increased approximately $138.6 million, or 30%, during fiscal 2003 as
compared to fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to strong growth in
sales of our virus protection and firewall/VPN product solutions. Net revenues
increased $172.2 million, or 61%, during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal
2001. The increase was primarily due to our first full year of sales of
intrusion detection, security management and firewall product solutions, as a
result of our acquisition of AXENT in December 2000, and in particular,
significant growth in sales of virus protection product solutions.

Our Enterprise Administration segment offers products that enable companies to
be more effective and efficient within their information technology
departments. Our Enterprise Administration segment represented approximately
15%, 21% and 27% of net revenues during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Net revenues decreased approximately $7.5 million, or 3%, during
fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 and decreased $8.1 million, or 4%,
during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. These decreases were primarily
due to a decrease in sales of our pcAnywhere product, partially offset by
growth in our Ghost Corporate Edition product. We anticipate net revenues from
this segment to comprise a smaller percentage of our overall revenues going
forward.

Our Consumer Products segment provides security and problem-solving products to
individual users, home offices and small businesses. Our Consumer Products
segment represented approximately 41%, 35% and 39% of net revenues during
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net revenues increased approximately
$194.1 million, or 52%, during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. This
increase was primarily related to stronger than expected consumer and small
business spending, which contributed to the increase in sales of our Norton
AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security products. Our electronic distribution
channel, including original equipment manufacturer subscription renewals, also
contributed to the increase in sales during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal
2002. Net revenues increased by approximately $45.8 million, or 14%, during
fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. This increase was primarily related to
an increase in sales of our Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security
products, mostly as a result of strong consumer and small business spending,
and an increase in the renewal subscription pricing of our antivirus products.
This increase was offset by a decline in sales of our Winfax and Macintosh
products.
We do not expect our Consumer Product net revenues to grow at as high a rate
during fiscal 2004 as during fiscal 2003.

Our Services segment provides information security solutions that incorporate
best-of-breed technology, security expertise and global resources. Our Services
segment represented approximately 2%, 1% and less than 1% of net revenues
during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net revenues increased
approximately $15.5 million, or 142%, during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal
2002. This increase was primarily related to sales from our managed security
services, which represented approximately $13.8 million of net revenues during
fiscal 2003. Net revenues increased approximately $8.6 million, or 378%, during
fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001, due primarily to the increase in demand
for our consulting services.

Our Other segment is comprised of sunset products and products nearing the end
of their life cycle and represented less than 1% of net revenues during each of
the fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001.

International

Net revenues outside of the United States represented approximately 49%, 47%
and 48% of net revenues during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
International net revenues increased by approximately $188.2 million, or 37%,
during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. This increase in net revenues
was primarily the result of sales growth in EMEA and to a lesser extent in
Japan, primarily from increased sales of our enterprise security and consumer
products. International net revenues increased by approximately $91.6 million,
or 22%, during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001. This increase in net
revenues was the result of increased sales in EMEA and Asia Pacific, primarily
from increased sales of our enterprise security and consumer products.



Strength in major foreign currencies during fiscal 2003, as compared to the
average major foreign currency rates during fiscal 2002, positively impacted
our international revenue growth by approximately $65.5 million. Weakness in
major foreign currencies during fiscal 2002, as compared to the average major
foreign currency rates during fiscal 2001, negatively impacted our
international revenue growth by approximately $14.0 million. We are unable to
predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by
changes in foreign currency rates. If international sales become a greater
proportion of our total sales in the future, changes in foreign exchange rates
may have a potentially greater impact on our revenues and operating results.

Gross Margin

Gross margin represents net revenues less cost of revenues. Cost of revenues
consists primarily of manufacturing expenses, costs for producing manuals and
CDs, packaging costs, royalties paid to third parties under publishing
contracts, costs of services, fee-based technical support costs and
amortization of acquired product rights.

As a percentage of net revenues, gross margin remained flat at approximately
82% during fiscal year 2003 and 2002 and was 84% during 2001. The decline in
gross margins during fiscal 2003 and 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was mostly
driven by increased amortization of acquired product rights from our four
acquisitions in September 2002 and our acquisition of AXENT in December 2000,
along with an increase in fee-based technical support costs related to
increased enterprise sales. In addition, the costs associated with services
increased with the corresponding increase in services revenue; and our services
typically generate lower gross margins than our software products.

Acquired Product Rights

Acquired product rights are comprised of purchased product rights,
technologies, databases and revenue related order backlog and contracts from
acquired companies. During fiscal 2003, we recorded approximately $40.1
million, net in acquired product rights related primarily to our acquisitions
of Riptech, Recourse, SecurityFocus and Mountain Wave, and during fiscal 2001,
we recorded approximately $86.2 million in acquired product rights in
connection with our acquisition of AXENT.

During fiscal 2003, amortization of acquired product rights totaled
approximately $32.1 million, of which $30.4 million and $1.8 million was
recorded in cost of revenues and income, net of expense, from sale of
technologies and product lines, respectively. During fiscal 2002, amortization
of acquired product rights totaled approximately $32.2 million, of which $31.1
million and $1.1 million was recorded in cost of
revenues and income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product
lines, respectively. During fiscal 2001, amortization of acquired product
rights totaled $17.3 million and was recorded in cost of revenues.

For further discussion on acquired product rights and related amortization, see
Note 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Research and Development Expenses

We charge research and development expenditures to operations as incurred. As a
percentage of net revenues, research and development expenses were 14% during
fiscal 2003 and remained flat at 15% during fiscal 2002 and 2001. Research and
development expenses increased 20% to approximately $197.3 million during
fiscal 2003 from $164.0 million during fiscal 2002 and 29% to $164.0 million
during fiscal 2002 from $126.7 million during fiscal 2001. The increase in
research and development expenses during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002
was primarily a result of increased headcount, salary increases, increased
infrastructure related expenditures and increased research and development
expenses associated with the companies that we acquired during fiscal 2003. The
increase in research and development expenses during fiscal 2002 as compared to
fiscal 2001 was primarily a result of salary increases and other employee
related expenses, infrastructure related expenditures and a full year of AXENT
related research and development expenses as compared to approximately three
months during fiscal 2001.

Sales and Marketing Expenses

Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 38% during
fiscal 2003 and remained flat at 40% during fiscal 2002 and 2001. Sales and
marketing expenses increased 23% to approximately $525.0 million during fiscal
2003 from $426.0 million during fiscal 2002 and 25% to $426.0 million during
fiscal 2002 from $341.5 million during fiscal 2001. The increase in sales and
marketing expenses during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily
a result of increased headcount, salary increases, higher commission expenses
due to the increase in sales, increased advertising and promotion expenses,
increased travel and entertainment expenses and increased sales and marketing
expenses associated with the companies that we acquired during fiscal 2003. The
increase in sales and marketing expenses during fiscal 2002 as compared to
fiscal 2001 was primarily related to Enterprise Security segment hiring, salary
and commission increases, outside services for consultants and contractors,



infrastructure related expenditures, and a full year of AXENT related sales and
marketing expenses as compared to approximately three months during fiscal
2001.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained
flat at 5% for each of the fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001. General and
administrative expenses increased 35% to approximately $74.4 million during
fiscal 2003 from $55.1 million during fiscal 2002 and 22% to $55.1 million
during fiscal 2002 from $45.1 million during fiscal 2001. The increase in
general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal
2002 was primarily a result of increased headcount, salary increases, increased
infrastructure related expenditures, increased legal fees, increased travel and
entertainment expenses and increased general and administrative expenses
associated with the companies that we acquired during fiscal 2003. The increase
in general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal
2001 was primarily due to AXENT related general and administrative expenses,
salary increases, legal fees, infrastructure related expenditures and bad debt
expense, offset by a reduction of other general and administrative expenses.

Amortization of Goodwill and Other Intangibles from Acquisitions

Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles from acquisitions decreased 99%
to approximately $2.8 million during fiscal 2003 from $199.0 million during
fiscal 2002. This decrease was due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on April 1,
2002, under which the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets deemed
to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized, but are subject to an annual
impairment test. Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles from
acquisitions increased 173% to approximately $199.0 million during fiscal 2002
from $72.8 million during fiscal 2001. This increase was related primarily to
the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with the
acquisition of AXENT in December 2000.

Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses

Acquired in-process research and development was $4.7 million during fiscal
2003, due to the Riptech, SecurityFocus and Recourse acquisitions in the
September 2002 quarter. We recorded no acquired in-process research and
development charges during fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2001, we acquired AXENT
and wrote off approximately $22.3 million of acquired in-process research and
development associated with this acquisition. These write-offs were necessary
because the acquired technologies had not yet reached technological feasibility
and there were no alternative uses.

The efforts required to develop the acquired in-process technology principally
related to the completion of all planning, design, development and testing
activities that are necessary to establish that the product or service can be
produced to meet its design specifications including features, functions and
performance. We expect the acquired in-process technology to be developed into
commercially feasible products. However, there are no assurances that this will
occur. If we fail to complete these products in their entirety, or in a timely
manner, we may not continue to attract new users, we may be unable to retain
our existing users and the value of the other intangible assets may become
impaired.

We determined the fair value of the acquired in-process technology for each of
the purchases by estimating the projected cash flows related to these projects
and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products. We
discounted the resulting cash flows back to their net present values. We based
the net cash flows from such projects on our analysis of the respective markets
and estimates of revenues and operating profits related to these projects.

A valuation specialist used our estimates to establish the amount of acquired
in-process research and development to be written off for these acquisitions
during fiscal 2003 and 2001. Actual spending on these product development
projects since our acquisition of the companies discussed below did not differ
materially from the original assumptions and projections discussed in prior
filings.

Riptech

The in-process technology acquired in the Riptech acquisition consisted
primarily of research and development related to the fourth generation of its
Caltarian technology, which provides real-time information protection through
around-the-clock monitoring, analysis and response. We plan to integrate this
technology into our managed security services.



SecurityFocus

The in-process technology acquired in the SecurityFocus acquisition consisted
primarily of research and development related to new versions of DeepSight
Threat Management System and DeepSight Analyzer products, which are threat
management systems that provide early warnings of attack, as well as
countermeasures to defend these attacks. We plan to integrate this technology
into our security management products.

Recourse

The in-process technology acquired in the Recourse acquisition consisted
primarily of research and development related to new versions of ManHunt, a
network intrusion detection system. We plan to integrate this technology into
our intrusion detection products.

AXENT

The in-process technology acquired in the AXENT acquisition consisted primarily
of research and development related to the next generation of ESM, Intruder
Alert, Raptor Firewall, Webthority and other projects. AXENT’s research and
development was focused on providing more robust features in its development of
these next generation products. We have added these projects to our product
offerings, with the exception of Webthority, which was divested with our web
access management product line in August 2001.

Restructuring, Site Closures and Other

Restructuring, site closures and other were approximately $11.1 million, $20.4
million and $3.7 million during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
During fiscal 2003, we recorded approximately $8.7 million for costs of
severance, related benefits and outplacement services primarily associated with
the relocation of our Leiden, Netherlands operations to Dublin, Ireland, the
relocation of certain development,
sales and finance activities, the outsourcing of our North American and
European consumer support functions, the realignment of certain worldwide
marketing efforts, and the reduction in operations in San Antonio, Texas. As a
result, we terminated 424 employees. In addition, we recorded approximately
$3.5 million for exit costs associated with the consolidation of certain
facilities in the United States. These expenses were offset by a net reduction
in expenses of approximately $1.1 million, due primarily to revised estimates
of certain fiscal 2002 facility related expenses.

During fiscal 2002, we incurred expenses related to consolidating smaller sites
into a larger facility in Newport News, Virginia, consolidating most of our
United Kingdom facilities to Maidenhead, UK, consolidating our European support
functions by moving our Leiden, Netherlands facility to Dublin, Ireland and
relocating our North American support group to Springfield, Oregon. As a
result, we recorded approximately $17.8 million for exit costs, including $12.8
million in rent and related exit costs remaining on the abandoned facilities
and $5.0 million in related abandoned fixed asset and leasehold improvement
write-offs. In addition, we recorded approximately $2.6 million for costs of
severance, related benefits and outplacement services, as we reorganized
various operating functions, including former AXENT operations, and terminated
87 employees.

During fiscal 2001, we reorganized various operating functions, including a
portion of our operations in Toronto. We terminated 60 employees and ten
members of our senior management, and as a result, we recorded approximately
$3.7 million for costs of severance, related benefits, outplacement services
and abandonment of certain equipment.

For further discussion on restructuring, site closures and other, see Note 13
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Litigation Judgment

During the March 2002 quarter, we accrued litigation expenses of approximately
$3.1 million for post-judgment interest and other costs related to a judgment
by a Canadian court on a decade-old copyright action assumed by us as a result
of our acquisition of Delrina Corporation. For further discussion on our
current litigation, see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
of this Form 10-K. There was no corresponding accrual during fiscal 2003 or
fiscal 2001.

Operating Income

Operating income was approximately $341.5 million, $8.0 million and $109.6
million during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The primary factor in
the increase between fiscal 2002 and 2003 was our adoption of SFAS No. 142. As
a result, in fiscal 2003, we recorded no amortization of goodwill, compared
with a charge of $196.8 million during fiscal 2002. In addition, strength in
major foreign currencies during fiscal 2003, as compared to the average major
foreign currency rates during fiscal 2002, positively impacted our operating
income growth by approximately $19.9 million. Weakness in major foreign
currencies during fiscal 2002, as compared to the average major foreign



currency rates during fiscal 2001, negatively impacted our operating income
growth by approximately $12.1 million. We are unable to predict the extent to
which operating income in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign
currency rates.

Interest Income, Interest Expense and Other Expense, Net

Interest income was approximately $37.7 million, $31.7 million and $33.3
million during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase was due
to higher average invested cash balances during fiscal 2003 as compared to
fiscal 2002. Although interest income was relatively flat during fiscal 2002
and fiscal 2001, average cash balances were higher during fiscal 2002 as
compared to fiscal 2001, which was offset by a decrease in average interest
rates.

Interest expense was approximately $21.2 million and $9.2 million during fiscal
2003 and 2002, respectively, nearly all of which was related to the issuance of
$600.0 million of 3% convertible subordinated notes in October 2001. Interest
expense was not significant during fiscal 2001.

Other expense, net of approximately $1.3 million and $0.6 million during fiscal
2003 and 2002, respectively, was primarily comprised of net losses from
non-functional currency transactions. Other
expense, net was approximately $22.5 million during fiscal 2001 and consisted
primarily of impairment charges on our equity investments.

Income, Net of Expense, From Sale of Technologies and Product Lines

Income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines was
approximately $6.9 million, $15.5 million and $20.4 million during fiscal 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. During fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, income, net of
expense, from sale of technologies and product lines was related primarily to
royalty payments received, in connection with the divestiture of our ACT!
product line in December 1999, from Interact Commerce Corporation, which
subsequently merged with The Sage Group plc. During fiscal 2003, this royalty
income was offset by the write-off of approximately $2.7 million of developed
technology related to the web access management products that were divested in
the September 2001 quarter.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate on income before taxes was approximately 32%, 162% and
55% during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The higher effective tax
rate in fiscal 2002 and 2001 reflects the non-deductibility of acquired
in-process research and development and substantially all of the goodwill
amortization.

Realization of our net deferred tax asset at March 31, 2003 is dependent
primarily upon future U.S. taxable income and our implementation of tax
planning strategies. We believe it is more likely than not that the net
deferred tax assets will be realized based on historical earnings and expected
levels of future taxable income as well as the implementation of tax planning
strategies.

Levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and
uncertainties discussed in the Business Risk Factors set forth in this Item 7.
An additional valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets may be
necessary if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net
deferred tax assets will not be realized. We will assess the need for an
additional valuation allowance on a quarterly basis.

We project our effective tax rate to be 32% for fiscal 2004. This projection,
however, is subject to change due to potential tax law changes and fluctuations
in the geographic distribution of earnings.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal source of liquidity is our cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments as well as the cash that we generate over time from our operations.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased $330.6 million to
approximately $1.7 billion at the end of fiscal 2003 from $1.4 billion at the
end of fiscal 2002. This increase is primarily due to cash provided by
operations, net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sales of common
stock through our employee stock purchase plan. The cash provided by these
factors was partially offset by cash paid for the companies we acquired during
fiscal 2003, capital expenditures and the repurchase of common stock.

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 was
approximately $583.9 million, $511.2 million and $324.5 million, respectively.
During fiscal 2003, net cash provided by operating activities was comprised
primarily of net income of approximately $248.4 million, net non-cash related
expenses of $140.9 million, and an increase in liabilities, net of assets, of
$194.6 million. During fiscal 2002, net cash provided by operating activities
was comprised of net non-cash related expenses of approximately $339.4 million
and an increase in liabilities, net of assets, of $199.9 million, offset by a
net loss of approximately $28.2 million. During fiscal 2001,



net cash provided
by operating activities was comprised of non-cash related expenses of
approximately $157.4 million, net income of $63.9 million, and an increase in
liabilities, net of assets, of $103.2 million.

Net trade accounts receivable increased $60.4 million to approximately $149.7
million as of March 31, 2003 from $89.2 million as of March 31, 2002. The
increase in net trade accounts receivable was primarily due to higher sales in
the month of March 2003 compared to the month of March 2002 and an unusually
low net trade accounts receivable balance at March 31, 2002 as compared to the
prior six quarter-end balances. In prior quarters, we had generated a larger
percentage of net revenues during the last month of each quarter.

Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 was
approximately $756.6 million, $869.3 million and $24.2 million, respectively.
During fiscal 2003, net cash used in investing activities was comprised
primarily of approximately $367.5 million in acquisition related costs, $194.8
million in net purchases of marketable securities and other investments and
$192.2 million of capital expenditures. During the March 2003 quarter, we
exercised our option to purchase four of our facilities, previously accounted
for as operating leases, for approximately $123.9 million. During fiscal 2002,
net cash used in investing activities was comprised primarily of approximately
$721.7 million in net purchases of marketable securities and other investments,
and $140.9 million of capital expenditures. During fiscal 2001, net cash used
in investing activities was comprised primarily of approximately $73.4 million
of capital expenditures and other investing activities, offset by $60.2 million
in net proceeds from sales of marketable securities and other investments and
$37.4 million in acquired AXENT cash balances.

Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2003 and 2002 was
approximately $73.4 million and $514.1 million, respectively, and net cash used
in financing activities during fiscal 2001 was $198.3 million. During fiscal
2003, net cash provided by financing activities was comprised primarily of
approximately $137.7 million in net proceeds from the exercise of stock options
and sales of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan, offset by
$64.3 million for repurchases of common stock. During fiscal 2002, net cash
provided by financing activities was comprised primarily of approximately
$584.6 million in net proceeds from the issuance of 3% convertible subordinated
notes in October 2001 and $133.9 million in net proceeds from exercise of stock
options and sales of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan,
offset by approximately $204.4 million for repurchases of common stock. During
fiscal 2001, net cash used in financing activities was comprised primarily of
approximately $244.4 million for repurchases of common stock, offset by $46.4
million in net proceeds from exercise of stock options and sales of common
stock through our employee stock purchase plan.

On January 16, 2001, the Board of Directors replaced an earlier stock
repurchase program with a new authorization to repurchase up to $700.0 million
of Symantec’s common stock, not to exceed 30.0 million shares, with no
expiration date. As of March 31, 2003, we had repurchased a total of 21.9
million shares under this program at prices ranging from $17.78 to $29.97 per
share, for an aggregate amount of approximately $513.2 million. During fiscal
2003, we repurchased 2.2 million shares at prices ranging from $27.93 to $29.97
per share, for an aggregate amount of approximately $64.3 million. During
fiscal 2002, we repurchased 9.6 million shares at prices ranging from $17.78 to
$24.50 per share, for an aggregate amount of approximately $204.4 million.
During fiscal 2001, we repurchased 10.0 million shares at prices ranging from
$23.04 to $25.58 per share, for an aggregate amount of approximately $244.4
million.

On October 24, 2001, we completed a private offering of $600.0 million of 3%
convertible subordinated notes due November 1, 2006, the net proceeds of which
were approximately $584.6 million. The notes are convertible into shares of
Symantec common stock by the holders at any time before maturity at a
conversion price of $34.14 per share, subject to certain adjustments. During
fiscal 2003, an immaterial principal amount of our notes were converted into
shares of our common stock. We may redeem the remaining notes on or after
November 5, 2004, at a redemption price of 100.75% of stated principal during
the period November 5, 2004 through October 31, 2005 and 100% thereafter.
Interest is paid semi-annually, commencing May 1, 2002.

On April 17, 2003, we purchased certain assets related to Roxio Inc.’s GoBack
computer recovery software business for approximately $13.0 million.

Also on May 13, 2003, we entered into an agreement to acquire Nexland, Inc., a
technology driven Internet security company whose Internet Protocol based
networking appliances are installed at enterprise branches and telecommuter
offices worldwide, for approximately $19.6 million. We expect to complete the
acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.

The above table assumes that the convertible subordinated notes will be paid in
cash upon maturity and excludes the balance of our current liabilities.

We believe that existing cash and short-term investments, cash generated from
operating results and cash from the subordinated convertible debenture offering
will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next year.

NEWLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

On April 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to
have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an
annual impairment test. Other intangibles will continue to be amortized over
their useful lives. In addition, SFAS No. 142 required acquired
workforce-in-place to be reclassified as goodwill.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we ceased the amortization of goodwill and
recharacterized acquired workforce-in-place (and the related deferred tax
liability) as goodwill on April 1, 2002. We also performed the initial goodwill
impairment test required by SFAS No. 142 during the June 2002 quarter. We
identified four reporting units, which represent our primary operating segments
as indicated in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this
Form 10-K, and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill recorded
upon implementation of SFAS No. 142. We completed our annual goodwill
impairment test during the March 2003 quarter and determined that there was no
impairment of goodwill. We will continue to test for impairment during the
fourth quarter of each year, or earlier if indicators of impairment exist.

As a result of the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill existing as
of March 31, 2002, the application of SFAS No. 142 resulted in an increase in
our results of operations of approximately $198.4 million during fiscal 2003.
At March 31, 2003, we had goodwill of approximately $833.4 million.

On April 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121,

Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed Of

and elements of APB No. 30,

Reporting the Results of Operations –
Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and Extraordinary,
Unusual, and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.

SFAS No. 144
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposal of
long-lived assets. The adoption of this statement did not have a material
impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities

. SFAS No. 146 requires that the liability for
a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the
liability is incurred rather than when a commitment is made to an exit or
disposal plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should
initially be measured and recorded at fair value. SFAS No. 146 became effective
for exit or disposal activities that were initiated after December 31, 2002.
The adoption of this statement may result in recognizing the cost of future
restructuring activities, if any, over a period of time rather than in the
reporting period that the plan of restructuring is adopted.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others.

Under this Interpretation, a liability shall be
recognized for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing or
modifying guarantees and indemnification agreements after December 31, 2002.
Certain of the software licenses that we have granted contain provisions that
indemnify licensees of the software from damages and costs resulting from
claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual property rights of
a third party. We have historically received only a limited number of requests
for indemnification under these provisions and have not been required to make
material payments pursuant to these provisions. Accordingly, we have not
recorded a liability related to these indemnification provisions. As of March
31, 2003, we had no liability associated with any of our indemnification
agreements on our balance sheet.



In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51,

that provides
guidance for determining when a primary beneficiary should
consolidate a variable interest entity that functions to support the activities
of the primary beneficiary. The effective date of Interpretation No. 46 is the
first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003 for variable interest
entities acquired before February 1, 2003 and immediately to variable interest
entities created after January 31, 2003. In the March 2003 quarter, we
purchased four of our facilities that were classified as operating leases under
synthetic lease transactions by purchasing the land and buildings for
approximately $17.9 million and $106.0 million, respectively. As such, we had
no interest in any variable interest entities as of March 31, 2003.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

, which provides
guidance for classification and measurement of certain financial instruments
with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 is effective
for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and
otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning
after June 15, 2003. The adoption of this statement will not have an impact on
our financial position or results of operations.

BUSINESS RISK FACTORS

There is uncertainty as to whether or not we will be able to sustain the growth
rates in sales of our products, particularly in consumer antivirus protection
products.

During fiscal 2003 and the second half of fiscal 2002, we
experienced a higher than expected rate of growth in sales of our consumer
antivirus protection products, and we expect that we will not be able to
sustain this high growth rate on a consistent basis. We believe that consumer
antivirus sales have been spurred by a number of factors over the past six
quarters, including increased broadband connection, increased awareness of
security threats to consumer systems, particularly the well-publicized Code
Red, Nimda, Klez, Opaserv, Yaha, Bugbear, Lovegate and Slammer threats and a
reaction from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The impact of these
factors is likely to diminish over time, and it is possible that growth rates
in sales of antivirus protection products may decline.

Our efforts to develop and sell appliances and integrated solutions involve
risk.

We have recently begun selling appliances in which our software is
embedded with hardware. Because of our limited experience with the manufacture
of appliances, and because our appliances generate lower gross margins than our
software products, our efforts to develop and sell appliances may not be as
successful as we anticipate. In addition, our strategy for future growth
includes integrating our various security technologies, management, customer
service and support into a single enterprise security solution. We have begun
implementing this strategy by selling integrated solutions, such as Symantec
Gateway Security and Symantec Client Security. Our integrated solutions may not
achieve market acceptance and may not be able to compete with solutions either
currently in the market or introduced in the future. If we are unable to
achieve market acceptance or compete effectively with solutions of our
competitors, our future net revenues and operating results could be adversely
affected.

Economic and political conditions and conditions affecting the network security
market in particular may have a negative impact on our revenues and margins.

The market for our products depends on economic conditions affecting the
broader network security, Internet infrastructure and related markets. More
generally, the slowdown in the U.S. economy may hurt consumer demand for our
products. On the enterprise side, the continued slowdown in corporate earnings
and tightening of corporate budgets may cause potential customers to delay or
cancel security projects, reduce their overall or security-specific information
technology budgets, or reduce or cancel orders for our products. Further, in
this environment, customers may experience financial difficulty, cease
operations or fail to budget for the purchase of our products. This, in turn,
may lead to longer sales cycles, price pressures and collection issues, causing
us to realize lower revenues and margins. In addition, the terrorist acts of
September 11, 2001 and the fall-out of the war in the Middle East have created
an uncertain economic and political environment in many parts of the world, and
we cannot predict the impact of these events, or of any related military
action, on our customers or business.

We face risks associated with our foreign operations.

A significant portion of
our manufacturing costs and operating expenses result from transactions outside
of the United States, often in foreign currencies. Our international sales have
been increasing as a percentage of our total sales and, for the first time
during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, comprised slightly more
than 50% of our total sales. In fiscal
year 2003, our operating results have been positively affected by changes in
foreign currency rates. Our future operating results will continue to be
subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates, especially if international
sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales, and we may be
negatively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future.
Our operating results could also be adversely affected by general uncertainty
with each country’s political and



economic structure. In addition, governmental
regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain any required export
approval of our technologies, particularly our encryption technologies, could
impede our international sales. In light of recent terrorist activity and
political and military instability internationally, governments could enact
additional regulation or restrictions on the use, import or export of
encryption technologies. Additional regulation of encryption technologies could
delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public
networks for secure communications. This might decrease demand for our products
and services.

In addition, the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) could
have an adverse impact on our operations in Asia. If there is a significant
spread of SARS beyond Asia, other aspects of our operations could be negatively
impacted.

Demand for our products is subject to seasonal trends.

Although there is no
assurance this trend will continue, our sales of consumer products over the
last seven years have been seasonal, with higher sales generally in our
December and March quarters. In addition, we anticipate that sales of
enterprise security products may be higher in the March quarter in the future,
as our sales force attempts to close transactions before the end of our fiscal
year. To the extent seasonality makes it more difficult to predict our revenues
and value our business, our stock price may suffer and the volatility of our
stock may increase.

Introduction and integration of new products and technology may adversely
affect our financial results.

We have recently introduced new products,
including newly acquired products and products incorporating newly acquired
technology from our acquisitions. Examples of these products include ManHunt,
Symantec Decoy Server (formerly ManTrap), DeepSight Threat Management System
and DeepSight Alert Services. These products may not achieve market acceptance
and/or may not be able to compete with products either currently in the market
or introduced in the future. If these products do not achieve market success,
we may not achieve operating results that investors and analysts expect and, as
a result, the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected.

Increased reliance on sales of enterprise licenses may result in greater
fluctuations in, or otherwise adversely affect, our financial results.

Sales
of enterprise licenses through our Enterprise Security segment represent a
major portion of our business. Enterprise licensing arrangements involve a
longer sales cycle than sales through other distribution channels, require
greater investment of resources in establishing the enterprise relationship,
may involve greater pricing pressure and sometimes result in lower operating
margins. In recent quarters, the number of higher dollar-value enterprise
license contracts has increased and our reliance on such contracts in the
future may result in increased uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues. In
addition, the timing of the execution of volume licenses, or their nonrenewal
by large customers, could cause our results of operations to vary significantly
from quarter to quarter and could have a material adverse impact on our results
of operations.

We are dependent upon certain partners to distribute our products and we would
be adversely affected if these relationships terminate or diminish.

A large
portion of our enterprise sales is made through value-added and other
resellers, and a large portion of our consumer sales is made through the retail
distribution channel. Reliance on these channels subjects us to events that
cause unpredictability in demand. This increases the risk that we may not plan
effectively for the future, which could result in adverse operating results in
future periods. Our distribution partners may also offer our competitors’
products. Their decisions to sell our products are partly a function of
pricing, terms and special promotions offered by our competitors and other
factors that we do not control and cannot predict. Our agreements with partners
are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated by them or by us without
cause. We would be adversely affected if companies in our partner program chose
to sell greater amounts of competitive offerings relative to the amount they
sell of our offerings.

In addition, one of the channels through which we sell our consumer products is
original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, who bundle our antivirus and other
products with their PCs. We continuously seek to establish new OEM
relationships and, conversely, are subject to OEMs who bundle our software
with their products deciding either to discontinue bundling third party
security software or to switch to a competitor’s product. When we lose an OEM
relationship, our consumer sales could be adversely affected unless and until
we are able to establish new relationships of similar significance.

Some distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past.
Distribution partners may experience financial difficulties in the future. If
these partners do experience financial difficulties, we may experience reduced
sales or increased write-offs, which would adversely affect our operating
results.



We have grown, and may continue to grow, through acquisitions, which give rise
to a number of risks that could have adverse consequences for our future
operating results.

We completed four acquisitions during the September 2002
quarter, have announced two additional acquisitions during fiscal 2004, and
will likely pursue future acquisitions. Integrating acquired businesses has
been and will continue to be a complex, time consuming and expensive process.
To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our technology systems in
the acquired operations and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired
operations. Our success in completing the integration of acquired businesses
may impact the market acceptance of such acquisitions, and our willingness to
acquire additional businesses in the future. Further, the difficulties of
integrating acquired businesses could disrupt our ongoing business, distract
our management focus from other opportunities and challenges, and increase our
expenses and working capital requirements. Our recent acquisitions have
resulted in, and acquisitions we complete in the future may also cause us to
recognize, substantial amounts of goodwill that will be subject to an annual,
or if events require, a more frequent impairment test and other intangible
assets that will be amortized and also subject to impairment testing. In
addition, acquisitions may result in substantial restructuring and other
related expenses and write-offs of acquired in-process research and development
costs. Further, we may need to issue equity or incur additional debt to finance
future acquisitions, which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders or
could increase our leverage. Any of these and other factors could harm our
ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired operations
or to realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition.

Our markets are competitive and our operating results and financial condition
could be adversely affected if we are unable to anticipate or react to this
competition.

Our markets are competitive. If we are unable to anticipate or
react to this competition, our operating results could be adversely affected by
reducing our sales or the prices we can charge for our products. Many of our
competitors have significantly lowered, and may continue to lower, the price of
their products and we may have to do the same to remain competitive. Our
ability to remain competitive depends, in part, on our ability to enhance our
products or develop new products that are compatible with new hardware and
operating systems. We have no control over, and limited insight into,
development efforts by third parties with respect to new hardware and operating
systems, and we may not respond effectively or timely to such changes in the
market. In addition, we have limited resources and we must make strategic
decisions as to the best allocation of our resources to position ourselves for
changes in our markets. We may from time to time allocate resources to projects
or markets that do not develop as rapidly or fully as we expect. We may fail to
allocate resources to third party products, to markets or to business models
that are more successful than we anticipate.

The trend toward consolidation in the software industry could impede our
ability to compete effectively.

Consolidation is underway among companies in
the software industry as firms seek to offer more extensive suites of software
products and broader arrays of software and integrated software and hardware
solutions. Changes resulting from this consolidation may negatively impact our
competitive position. In addition, to the extent that we seek to expand our
product lines and skills and capacity through acquisitions, the trend toward
consolidation may result in our encountering competition, and paying higher
prices, for acquired businesses.

Operating system providers, and network equipment and computer hardware
manufacturers are becoming substantial competitors in the market for security
solutions.

These competitors generally have significantly greater financial,
marketing or technological resources than we do, and may leverage their
strengths at the computing platform, security layer and network tier levels to
compete more aggressively in the market for security solutions. Continued
development, acquisition, or licensing of security solutions technology or
products rights by one or more of these competitors could negatively impact our
competitive position in the market for security solutions.

For example, the continued inclusion of security, remote access or virus
protection tools in new operating systems and hardware packages could adversely
affect our sales. In particular, the inclusion of features by Microsoft in
future editions of Windows which directly compete with our products may
decrease or delay the demand for certain of our products, including those
currently under development. Additionally, as hardware vendors incorporate
security functions in the network equipment or integrate security within their
network and system management products, the demand may decrease for some of our
products, including those currently under development.

Piracy of our software may have a significant impact on our net revenues.

Although we are unable to determine the extent of piracy of our software
products, software piracy may depress our net revenues. While this would
adversely affect domestic revenue, revenue loss is believed to be even more
significant outside of the United States, particularly in countries where laws
are less protective of intellectual property rights. We engage in efforts to
educate consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and to educate
lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property
rights are protected, and we cooperate with the Business Software Alliance in
their efforts to combat piracy. However, such continued efforts may not be
successful in preventing piracy of our products from occurring.



Our software products and web site may be subject to intentional disruption.

Although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional
disruptions, such as software viruses specifically designed to impede the
performance of our products, we expect to be an ongoing target of such
disruptions. Similarly, experienced computer programmers, or hackers, may
attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our web site and
misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services.
Uninterrupted online availability of our web site is becoming increasingly
important as online subscription renewals comprise a larger portion of our
revenues. Our activities could be substantially disrupted, and our reputation
and future sales harmed, if these efforts are successful.

Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results have affected our stock price
in the past and could affect our stock price in the future.

If our quarterly
operating results or our predictions of future operating results fail to meet
the expectations of analysts and investors, the trading price of shares of our
common stock and of the notes could be negatively affected. Our quarterly
operating results have varied substantially in the past and may vary
substantially in the future depending upon a number of factors, including:

Any such volatility may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the
future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our common stock or
securities convertible or exercisable into our common stock.

In addition to the foregoing factors, the risk of quarterly fluctuations is
increased by the fact that a significant portion of our net revenues has
historically been generated during the last month of each fiscal quarter. Most
resellers tend to make a majority of their purchases at the end of a fiscal
quarter. In addition, many enterprise customers negotiate site licenses near
the end of each quarter. Our reliance on a large portion of revenue occurring
at the end of the quarter and the increase in the dollar value of transactions
that occur at the end of a quarter can result in increased uncertainty relating
to quarterly revenues. Due to this end-of-period buying pattern, forecasts may
not be achieved, either because expected sales do not occur or because they
occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us. In addition,
these factors increase the chances that our results could diverge from the
expectations of investors and analysts.

We continue to make substantial changes to our information systems that could
disrupt our business.

During fiscal 2002, we began implementing Oracle 11i and
a new customer relationship management system. We completed the worldwide
implementation of Oracle 11i in the September 2002 quarter. The first four
phases of the CRM implementation occurred in June 2001, February 2002, June
2002 and
November 2002, with the remaining implementation phase scheduled for the first
quarter of fiscal 2004. These types of transitions frequently prove disruptive
to the underlying business of an enterprise and may cause us to incur higher
costs than we anticipate. Failure to manage a smooth transition to the new
systems and the ongoing operations and support of the new systems could
materially harm our business operations.

We must effectively adapt to changes in the dynamic technological environment.

We are increasingly focused on the Internet security market, which, in turn is
dependent on further acceptance and increased use of the Internet. The
following critical issues concerning the use of the Internet remain unresolved
and may affect the market for our products and the use of the Internet as a
medium to distribute or support our software products and the functionality of
some of our products: security; reliability; cost; ease of use; accessibility;
quality of service; and potential tax or other government regulations.

In addition, new technologies, such as wireless devices, are gaining
acceptance. We must adapt to these changing technological demands. If we are
unable to timely assimilate changes brought about by the Internet and wireless
based environments, our future net revenues and operating results could be
adversely affected.

The results of our research and development efforts are uncertain.

We will
need to continue to incur significant research and development expenditures in
future periods as we strive to remain competitive. The length of our product
development cycle for new products and product enhancements has frequently been
greater than we originally expected, and we are likely to experience delays in
future product development. In addition, a portion of



our development efforts
has not been technologically successful and certain products have not achieved
market acceptance. As a result, the products we are currently developing or may
develop in the future may not be technologically successful, achieve market
acceptance or compete effectively with products of our competitors.

Product returns may negatively affect our net revenues.

Product returns can
occur when we introduce upgrades and new versions of products or when
distributors or retailers have excess inventories, subject to various
contractual limitations. Our return policy allows distributors, subject to
these contractual limitations, to return purchased products in exchange for new
products or credit towards future purchases. End-users may return our products
for a full refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase.
Future returns could exceed the reserves we have established for product
returns, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

We depend on internal communications systems that may be disrupted.

Our order
management and product shipping centers are geographically dispersed. A
business disruption could occur as a result of natural disasters or the
interruption in service by communications carriers. If our communications
between these centers are disrupted, particularly at the end of a fiscal
quarter, we may suffer an unexpected shortfall in net revenues and a resulting
adverse impact on our operating results. Communication outages, Internet
connectivity disruptions, and/or increased volumes of electronic distribution
transactions may also cause delays in customer access to our Internet-based
services or product sales.

We are subject to litigation that could adversely affect our financial results.

From time to time, we may be subject to claims that we have infringed the
intellectual property rights of others, or other product liability claims, or
other claims incidental to our business. We are currently involved in a number
of lawsuits. We intend to defend all of these lawsuits vigorously. However, it
is possible that we could suffer an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these
cases. Depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable resolutions of
these lawsuits, our future results of operations or cash flows could be
materially adversely affected in a particular period.

Although infringement claims may ultimately prove to be without merit, they are
expensive to defend and may consume our resources or divert our attention from
day-to-day operations. If a third party alleges that we have infringed their
intellectual property rights, we may choose to litigate the claim and/or seek
an appropriate license from the third party. If we engage in litigation and the
third party is found to have a valid patent claim against us and a license is
not available on reasonable terms, our business, operating results and
financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

We must attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace.

We believe
that our future success will depend in part on our ability to recruit and
retain highly skilled management, sales, marketing and technical personnel. To
accomplish this, we believe that we must provide personnel with a competitive
compensation package, including stock options. Increases in shares available
for issuance under our stock options plans require stockholder approval in many
cases, and institutional stockholders, or stockholders generally, may not
approve future increases. Additionally, the accounting industry has recently
determined that corporations will include a compensation expense in their
statement of operations relating to the issuance of employee stock options.
This will most likely become effective in calendar year 2004. As a result, we
may decide to issue fewer stock options and may be impaired in our efforts to
attract and retain necessary personnel. Conversely, issuing a comparable number
of stock options could adversely impact our results of operations.

Our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be adequately
protected from all unauthorized uses.

We regard our software and underlying
technology as proprietary. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a
combination of confidentiality agreements and copyright, patent, trademark and
trade secret laws. Third parties may copy aspects of our products or otherwise
obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or develop
similar technology independently. All of our products are protected by
copyright laws, and we have a number of patents and patent applications
pending. We may not achieve the desired protection from, and third parties may
design around, our patents. In addition, existing copyright laws afford limited
practical protection. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not
offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the
United States, and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products. Any
legal action that we may bring to protect proprietary information could be
expensive and may distract management from day-to-day operations.

Our inabilities to timely distribute our products and services over the
Internet, and security patches and updated virus definitions via our LiveUpdate
feature in particular, could adversely affect our business.

Our ability to
maintain and increase the speed with which we provide services to consumers and
to increase the scope of these services is limited by and dependent upon the
speed and reliability of the Internet. As we incorporate the



LiveUpdate
technology into more of our products, we are increasingly reliant on the
Internet as a means to distribute our security patches and updated virus
definitions to our customers. Accordingly, if we, or our customers, are unable
to utilize the Internet due to a failure of technology, infrastructure or other
reasons, our ability to provide services may suffer, which could lead to a
decrease in revenues.

Our products are complex and are operated in a wide variety of computer
configurations, which could result in errors or product failures.

Because we
offer very complex products, undetected errors, failures or bugs may occur when
they are first introduced or when new versions are released. Our products often
are installed and used in large-scale computing environments with different
operating systems, system management software and equipment and networking
configurations, which may cause errors or failures in our products or may
expose undetected errors, failures or bugs in our products. In the past, we
have discovered software errors, failures and bugs in certain of our product
offerings after their introduction and have experienced delays or lost revenues
during the period required to correct these errors. Our customers’ computer
environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and
non-standard configurations that make pre-release testing for programming or
compatibility errors very difficult and time-consuming. Despite testing by us
and by others, errors, failures or bugs may not be found in new products or
releases after commencement of commercial shipments. Errors, failures or bugs
in products released by us could result in negative publicity, product returns,
loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products or claims by customers or
others. In addition, if an actual or perceived breach of network security
occurs in one of our end customer’s security systems, regardless of whether the
breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of the
effectiveness of our products could be harmed. Because the techniques used by
computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally
are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to
anticipate these techniques. Alleviating any of these problems could require
significant expenditures of our capital and resources and could cause
interruptions, delays or cessation of our product licensing, which could cause
us to lose existing or potential customers and would adversely affect results
of operations.

Most of our license agreements with customers contain provisions designed to
limit our exposure to potential product liability claims. It is possible,
however, that these provisions may not prove effective in limiting our
liability.

Increased utilization and costs of our technical support services may adversely
affect our financial
results.

Like many companies in the software industry, technical support costs
comprise a significant portion of our operating costs and expenses. Over the
short term, we may be unable to respond to fluctuations in customer demand for
support services, including periods of high customer usage in which delays may
be experienced. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support
services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors.
Further, customer demand for these services could cause increases in the costs
of providing such services and adversely affect our operating results.

Over the past year, we have outsourced our North American and European consumer
support functions. As such, we are highly dependent on the on-going business
success of the companies with whom we have contracted to provide these
services. If these companies experience financial difficulties, do not maintain
sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts or
otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts, the
level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted,
which could materially harm our relationships with these customers.



Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in market prices,
interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates. We use certain derivative
financial instruments to manage these risks. All financial instruments used are
in accordance with our global investment policy and global foreign exchange
policy. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

We also hold equity interests in six privately-held companies. These
investments were recorded at cost, and are classified as other long-term assets
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are inherently risky and
we could lose our entire initial investment in these companies. As of March 31,
2003, these investments had a carrying value of approximately $10.5 million.

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY

We consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with an original
maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. All of our cash equivalents
and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale as of the
balance sheet dates. These securities are reported at fair market value and any
unrealized gains and losses are included as a component in stockholders’ equity
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our cash equivalents and
short-term investments consist primarily of corporate securities, taxable
auction rate securities, US government and government-sponsored securities,
money market funds and asset backed securities.

The following table presents the fair value and hypothetical changes in fair
market values of the financial instruments held as of March 31, 2003 that are
sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions):

The modeling technique used above measures the change in fair market value
arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes
reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of minus 75
basis points, minus 25 basis points, plus 50 basis points, plus 100 basis
points and plus 150 basis points, which are representative of the movements in
the United States Federal Funds Rate, Euro Area ECB Rate and Canada Overnight
Rate.

During October 2001, we issued $600.0 million of 3% convertible subordinated
notes. The notes pay interest semi-annually and mature on November 1, 2006. As
of March 31, 2003, we had approximately $600.0 million principal amount of
notes outstanding.

EXCHANGE RATE SENSITIVITY

We conduct business in 30 international currencies through our worldwide
operations. We believe that the use of foreign exchange forward contracts
should reduce the risks that arise from conducting business in international
markets.

We hedge risks associated with certain foreign currency cash, investments,
receivables and payables in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign
currency fluctuations on these assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies. Foreign exchange forward contracts as of March 31, 2003 were as

We believe that these foreign exchange forward contracts do not subject us to
undue risk from the movement of foreign exchange rates because gains and losses
on these contracts are offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and
liabilities. All contracts have a maturity of no more than 35 days. Gains and
losses are accounted for as other expense, net each period. We regularly review
our hedging program and may make changes as a result of this review.

Item 9: Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
Financial Disclosure

In September 2002, we dismissed Ernst & Young LLP as our independent auditors
and engaged KPMG LLP as our new independent auditors to audit our financial
statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003. We filed a current report
on Form 8-K on September 23, 2002, reporting these events.

The report of Ernst & Young LLP for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2002 and
2001 contained no adverse opinions, disclaimer of opinion or qualification or
modification as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

We have had no disagreements with our accountants on any accounting or
financial disclosures.

Item 14: Controls and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

The Securities and
Exchange Commission defines the term “disclosure controls and procedures”
to mean a company’s controls and other procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it
files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the Commission’s rules and forms. Our chief executive officer and our
chief financial officer, based on their evaluation of the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures within 90 days before the filing
date of this report, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective for this purpose.

(b)

Changes in Internal Controls.

There were no significant changes in our
internal controls or, to our knowledge, in other factors that could
significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of the evaluation
referenced above.

flow for the year ended March 31, 2003. Our audit also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) for the year ended March
31, 2003. These consolidated financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and schedule based on our
audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Symantec
Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flow for the year then ended in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also,
in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule for the year ended
March 31, 2003, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein.

As described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 142 (“SFAS No. 142”),

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

, as of April 1, 2002. As described in Note 4, these consolidated
financial statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures
required by SFAS No. 142. In our opinion, the disclosures for 2002 and 2001 in
Note 4 are appropriate. As described in Note 16, the disclosures in
the notes to the 2002 and 2001 consolidated financial statements relating to reportable segments have
been restated. We audited the adjustments that were applied to restate the disclosures for
reportable segments reflected in the 2002 and 2001 consolidated financial
statements. In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been
properly applied. As described in Note 17, the consolidated financial
statements as of March 31, 2002 and for each of the years in the two
year period then ended have been revised to reflect the
reclassification of certain amounts to achieve comparability with the 2003
financial statement presentation. In our opinion, the reclassifications for
2002 and 2001 are appropriate. However, we were not
engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2002 or 2001
consolidated financial statements of Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries
other than with respect to such aforementioned disclosures and
reclassifications, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other
form of assurance on the 2002 or 2001 consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole.

SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Symantec Corporation (“we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Symantec Corporation and
all of its subsidiaries) provides a broad range of content and network security
software and appliance solutions to enterprises, individuals and service
providers. We are a leading provider of client, gateway and server security
solutions for virus protection, firewall and virtual private network, security
management, intrusion detection, Internet content and e-mail filtering, remote
management technologies and security services to enterprises and service
providers around the world. Founded in 1982, we have offices in 36 countries
worldwide.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Symantec Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

During the three years ended March 31, 2003, we acquired:

•

Riptech, Inc., Recourse Technologies, Inc., SecurityFocus Inc., and
Mountain Wave, Inc. in the September 2002 quarter;

•

Lindner & Pelc Consult GmbH and Foster-Melliar Limited’s enterprise
security management division in the September 2001 quarter; and

•

AXENT Technologies, Inc. in the December 2000 quarter.

Each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly,
their operating results have been included in our consolidated financial
statements since their respective dates of acquisition.

We divested our web access management product line on August 24, 2001. This
product line is included in the results of operations prior to disposition and
is included in our Other segment.

See Note 3 for further discussion.

Fiscal Years

We have a 52/53-week fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references as of
and for the periods ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 reflect amounts as of
and for the periods ended March 28, 2003, March 29, 2002 and March 30, 2001,
respectively. The fiscal accounting years ended March 28, 2003, March 29, 2002
and March 30, 2001 each comprised 52 weeks of operations. The fiscal accounting
year ending April 2, 2004 will comprise of 53 weeks of operations.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using
the exchange rate on the balance sheet dates. The translation adjustments
resulting from this process are included as a component of stockholders’ equity
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Revenues and expenses are
translated using average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of net
income (loss).

Revenue Recognition

We derive revenue primarily from sales of packaged products, perpetual license
agreements, product maintenance and services, and recognize this revenue in
accordance with Statement of Position, or SOP, 97-2,

Software Revenue
Recognition,

as modified by SOP 98-9, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,

Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements

, when the following conditions have
been met:



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

We sell packaged products, which primarily include consumer products, through a
multi-tiered distribution channel. We defer revenue on all distribution and
reseller channel inventory in excess of specified inventory levels in these
channels. We defer a portion of revenue for product bundled with content
updates. This deferred revenue is recognized ratably over the initial year that
such updates are provided. We offer the right of return of our products under
various policies and programs with our distributors, resellers and end-user
customers. We estimate and record reserves for end-user product returns and
channel and end-user rebates, and we account for these reserves as an offset to
revenue.

We enter into perpetual software license agreements mainly for our enterprise
security and enterprise administration products primarily through indirect
sales with distributors and resellers. The license agreements generally include
product maintenance agreements, for which the related revenue is deferred and
recognized ratably over the period of the agreements.

Our services include managed security services, consulting and education. We
recognize managed security services revenue ratably over the period that such
contracted services are provided. We recognize consulting services revenue as
services are performed or upon written acceptance from customers, if
applicable. We recognize education services revenue as services are performed.

In arrangements that include perpetual software licenses and maintenance and/or
services and packaged products with content updates (“multiple elements”), we
allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor-specific
objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered elements, and
recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount
deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. Our deferred revenue consists
primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance and
consumer product content updates.

VSOE of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is
sold separately. We determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on
historical evidence of our stand-alone sales of these elements to third
parties. If VSOE does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance or
services, then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the
performance period.

Cash Equivalents, Short-term Investments and Restricted Investments

We consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with an original
maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Primarily all of our cash
equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale as
of the balance sheet dates. These securities are reported at fair market value
and any unrealized gains and losses are included as a component in
stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Realized
gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on
available-for-sale securities are included in other expense, net. The cost of
securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. Restricted
investments, previously serving as collateral for our synthetic lease
arrangements, no longer existed as of March 31, 2003, because we exercised our
option to purchase the related four facilities during the March 2003 quarter.

Trade Accounts Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not
interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for
potentially uncollectible trade receivables. We also review our trade
receivables by aging category to identify specific customers with known
disputes or collectibility issues. We exercise judgment when determining the
adequacy of these reserves as we evaluate historical bad debt trends, general
economic conditions in the U.S. and internationally, and changes in customer
financial conditions.

Equity Investments

We have equity investments in privately held companies for business and
strategic purposes. These investments are included in other long-term assets
and are accounted for under the cost method as we do not have significant
influence over the investee. Under the cost method, the investment is recorded
at its initial cost and is periodically reviewed for impairment. We regularly
review our investment’s actual and forecasted operating results, financial
position and liquidity, and business and industry factors in assessing whether
a decline in value of an equity investment has occurred that is other than
temporary. When such a decline in value is identified, the fair value of the
equity investment is estimated based on the preceding factors and an impairment
loss is recognized in other expense, net.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

Derivative Financial Instruments

We utilize some natural hedging to mitigate our foreign currency exposures and
we manage certain residual exposures through the use of one-month forward
foreign exchange contracts. We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts
with high-quality financial institutions primarily to minimize currency
exchange risks associated with certain balance sheet positions. Gains and
losses on the contracts are included in other expense, net in the period that
gains and losses on the underlying transactions are recognized, and generally
offset. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts approximates cost
due to the short maturity periods.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is principally
determined using currently adjusted standards, which approximate actual cost on
a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory consistsof raw materials and finished
goods.

Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements

Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, net of
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is
provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
respective assets as follows:

•

computer hardware and software – three to five years;

•

office furniture and equipment – three to five years;

•

leasehold improvements - the shorter of the lease term or seven years; and

•

buildings - twenty five to thirty years.

Acquired Product Rights

Acquired product rights are comprised of purchased product rights,
technologies, databases and revenue related order backlog and contracts from
acquired companies. Acquired product rights are stated at cost less accumulated
amortization. Amortization of acquired product rights is provided on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets,
generally one to five years, and is included in cost of revenues or income, net
of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines. On April 1, 2002, we
adopted Statement of Financial Standards, or SFAS, No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangibles.

As a result, the net balance of workforce-in-place, that was
previously included in acquired product rights, was reclassified to goodwill
and was no longer amortized, but subjected to an annual impairment test.

Goodwill

Goodwill is recorded through acquisitions. For acquisitions completed prior to
July 1, 2001, goodwill was stated at cost less accumulated amortization through
March 31, 2002. Amortization in each case was provided on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful life of the respective goodwill, generally four to
five years, and was included in operating expenses. On April 1, 2002, we ceased
the amortization of goodwill, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, and will test
goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if events and circumstances
warrant. See Note 4 for further discussion.

Long-Lived and Intangible Assets

On April 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

SFAS No. 144 requires that long-lived and
intangible assets, including property, equipment, leasehold improvements and
acquired product rights, be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the
undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. Such impairment
loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the
asset and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of would be separately
presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount
or fair value less costs to sell, and no longer depreciated. The assets and
liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented
separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance
sheet. The adoption of this standard did not have an effect on our financial
position or our operating results.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is
computed using the liability method, under which deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting
and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the periods. Diluted net income (loss) per
share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the
periods. Potentially dilutive common shares include the assumed conversion of
all of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes and assumed exercising of
options, if dilutive in the period. Potentially dilutive common shares are
excluded in net loss periods, as their effect would be antidilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method
in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion, or APB, No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and to nonemployees using the fair
value method in accordance with SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

. In addition, we apply applicable provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Interpretation No. 44,

Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation

, an interpretation of APB No.
25. Our stock plans are described in Note 12. No employee stock-based
compensation cost is reflected in net income (loss) related to options granted
under those plans for which the exercise price was equal to the market value of
the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income (loss) and net income
(loss) per share as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation for each of the three years
ended March 31, 2003:

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Our product revenues are concentrated in the software industry, which is highly
competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes in the
industry or customer requirements, or the emergence of competitive products
with new capabilities or technologies, could adversely affect operating
results. In addition, a significant portion of our revenues and net income
(loss) is derived from international sales and independent agents and
distributors. Fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies,
changes in local regulatory or economic conditions, piracy or nonperformance by
independent agents or distributors could adversely affect operating results.

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments and trade
accounts receivable. Our investment portfolio is diversified and consists of
investment grade securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit
risk exposure to any one issuer and in any one country. We are exposed to
credit risks in the event of default by the issuers to the extent of the amount
recorded on the balance sheet. The credit risk in our trade accounts receivable
is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process, reasonably short
collection terms and the geographical dispersion of sales transactions. We
maintain reserves for potential credit losses and such losses have been within
management’s expectations.

Legal Expenses

We accrue estimated legal expenses for lawsuits only when both of the
conditions of SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies,

are met. Costs for
external attorney fees are accrued when the likelihood of the incurrence of the
related costs is probable and management has the ability to estimate such
costs. If both of these conditions are not



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

met, management records the related
legal expenses when incurred. Amounts accrued by us are not discounted. The
material assumptions used to estimate the amount of legal expenses include:

Newly Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

On April 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to
have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an
annual impairment test. Other intangibles will continue to be amortized over
their useful lives. In addition, SFAS No. 142 required acquired
workforce-in-place to be reclassified as goodwill.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we ceased the amortization of goodwill and
recharacterized acquired workforce-in-place (and the related deferred tax
liability) as goodwill on April 1, 2002. We also performed the initial goodwill
impairment test required by SFAS No. 142 during the June 2002 quarter. We
identified four reporting units, which represents our primary operating
segments as indicated in Note 16, and determined that there was no impairment
of goodwill recorded upon implementation of SFAS No. 142. We completed our
annual goodwill impairment test during the March 2003 quarter and determined
that there was no impairment of goodwill. We will continue to test for
impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, or earlier if indicators of
impairment exist.

As a result of the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill existing as
of March 31, 2002, the application of SFAS No. 142 resulted in an increase in
our results of operations of approximately $198.4 million during fiscal 2003.
At March 31, 2003, we had goodwill of approximately $833.4 million.

On April 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121,

Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed Of

and elements of APB No. 30,

Reporting the Results of Operations –
Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and Extraordinary,
Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.

SFAS No. 144
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and disposal of
long-lived assets. The adoption of this statement did not have a material
impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities

. SFAS No. 146 requires that the liability for
a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the
liability is incurred rather than when a commitment is made to an exit or
disposal plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should
initially be measured and recorded at fair value. SFAS No. 146 became effective
for exit or disposal activities that were initiated after December 31, 2002.
The adoption of this statement may result in recognizing the cost of future
restructuring activities, if any, over a period of time rather than in the
reporting period that the plan of restructuring is adopted.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others.

Under this Interpretation, a liability shall be
recognized for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing or
modifying guarantees and indemnification arrangements after December 31, 2002.
Certain of the software licenses that we have granted contain provisions that
indemnify licensees of the software from damages and costs resulting from
claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual property rights of
a third party. We have historically received only a limited number of requests
for indemnification under these provisions and have not been required to make
material payments pursuant to these provisions. Accordingly, we have not
recorded a liability related to these indemnification provisions. As of March
31, 2003, we had no liability associated with any of our indemnification
agreements on our balance sheet.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51,

that provides
guidance for determining when a primary beneficiary should consolidate a
variable interest entity that functions to support the activities of the
primary beneficiary. The effective date of
Interpretation No. 46 is the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003
for variable interest entities acquired before February 1, 2003 and immediately
to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. In the March



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

2003 quarter, we purchased four of our facilities that were classified as
operating leases under synthetic lease transactions by purchasing the land and
buildings for approximately $17.9 million and $106.0 million, respectively. As
such, we had no interest in any variable interest entities as of March 31,
2003.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

, which provides
guidance for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31,
2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period
beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of this statement will not have an
impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Reclassifications

Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current presentation format with no impact on net income (loss).

Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures

During the September 2002 quarter, we acquired four privately-held companies
for a total of approximately $375.2 million in cash. We expect that the
acquisition of these emerging technologies will strengthen our competitive
position in the enterprise security solutions and managed security services
markets. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included
in our operations as of the dates of acquisition. These acquired companies are
included in our Enterprise Security segment, with the exception of Riptech,
which is included in our Services segment.

Riptech

On August 19, 2002, we acquired Riptech, Inc., a provider of scalable,
real-time managed security services that protect clients through advanced
outsourced security monitoring and professional services, for $145.0 million.
Under the transaction, we recorded approximately $2.1 million for acquired
in-process research and development, $12.2 million for developed technology,
$0.5 million for acquired product rights, including revenue related order
backlog and contracts, $117.8 million for goodwill, $8.0 million for net
deferred tax assets and $7.6 million for tangible assets, net of liabilities.
We also accrued approximately $3.2 million in acquisition related expenses,
which included financial advisory, legal and accounting fees, duplicative sites
and severance costs, of which $0.9 million remains as an accrual as of March
31, 2003.

The amounts allocated to developed technology and acquired product rights will
be amortized to cost of revenues over their useful lives of five years and one
year, respectively.

During the December 2002 quarter, we revised estimates related to certain
liabilities, and as a result, we decreased the purchase price and goodwill by
$0.9 million.

Recourse

On August 19, 2002, we acquired Recourse Technologies, Inc., a provider of
security threat management solutions that detect, analyze and respond to both
known and novel threats, including intrusions, internal attacks and denial of
service attacks, for approximately $135.3 million. Under the transaction, we
recorded approximately $1.0 million for acquired in-process research and
development, $19.0 million for developed technology, $109.3 million for
goodwill, $2.2 million for other intangibles, $9.1 million for net deferred tax
assets and $1.9 million for liabilities, net of tangible assets. We also
accrued approximately $3.3 million in acquisition related expenses, which
included financial advisory, legal, tax and accounting fees, duplicative sites
and severance costs, of which $1.0 million remains as an accrual as of March
31, 2003.

The amount allocated to developed technology will be amortized to cost of
revenues over the useful life of four years. The amount allocated to other
intangibles will be amortized to operating expenses over its useful life of one
year.

During the December 2002 quarter, we revised estimates related to certain
liabilities, and as a result, we decreased the purchase price and goodwill by
$0.2 million.

SecurityFocus

On August 5, 2002, we acquired SecurityFocus, Inc., a provider of enterprise
security threat management systems, providing global early warning of cyber
attacks, customized and comprehensive threat alerts, and countermeasures to
prevent attacks before they occur, for approximately $74.9 million. Under the
transaction, we recorded approximately $1.6 million for acquired in-process
research and development, $3.5 million for developed technology, $3.3 million
for acquired product rights, including database and revenue related order
backlog and contracts, $64.3 million for goodwill, $2.1 million for other
marketing related intangibles, $0.5 million for net deferred tax assets and
$1.2 million for tangible assets, net of liabilities. We also accrued
approximately $1.7 million in acquisition related expenses, which included
legal, tax and accounting fees, duplicative site and fixed asset expenses, and
severance costs, of which $0.9 million remains as an accrual as of March 31,
2003.

The amounts allocated to developed technology and acquired product rights will
be amortized to cost of revenues over their useful lives of one to four years.
The amount allocated to other intangibles will be amortized to operating
expenses over its useful life of four years.

During the December 2002 quarter, we revised estimates related to certain
liabilities, and as a result, we decreased the purchase price and goodwill by
$37,000.

Mountain Wave

On July 2, 2002, we acquired Mountain Wave, Inc., a provider of automated
attack sensing and warning software and services for real-time enterprise
security operations management, for $20.0 million. Under the transaction, we
recorded approximately $2.0 million for developed technology, $17.3 million for
goodwill, $1.7 million for net deferred tax assets and $0.4 million for
liabilities, net of tangible assets. We also accrued approximately $0.7 million
in acquisition related expenses, which included legal and accounting fees, as
well as duplicative site and severance costs. As of March 31, 2003, all costs
have been paid with the exception of an immaterial amount for outplacement
services and duplicative site costs.

The amount allocated to developed technology will be amortized to cost of
revenues over its useful life of five years.

A portion of the purchase price for each acquisition was placed into escrow and
may be returned to us in the event of a breach by the sellers of certain
general representations, warranties, covenants or agreements. The escrows are
scheduled to be settled within one year of the acquisition dates, subject to
extension in the event of disputes, and any funds returned to Symantec under
the terms of the escrow will result in a reduction to goodwill at that time.

The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price, adjusted
for revised estimates related to certain liabilities, for each of the
acquisitions during the September 2002 quarter (in thousands):

In connection with these four acquisitions, we wrote off a total of $4.7
million of acquired in-process research and development, because the acquired
technologies had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative
uses. The efforts required to develop the acquired in-process technology
principally relate to the completion of all planning, design, development and
test activities that are necessary to establish that the product or service can
be produced to meet its design specifications, including features, functions
and performance.

We determined the fair value of the acquired in-process technology for each of
the purchases by estimating the projected cash flows related to these projects
and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products. We
discounted the resulting cash flows back to their net present values. We based
the net cash flows from such projects on our analysis of the respective markets
and estimates of revenues and operating profits related to these projects.

Acquisition of Lindner & Pelc

On August 30, 2001, we purchased 100% of the outstanding shares of Lindner &
Pelc Consult GmbH, a security services and implementation company in Berlin,
Germany, for approximately $2.2 million. The transaction was accounted for as a
purchase and we recorded approximately $2.1 million in goodwill. Under the
terms of the agreement, we may also be liable for contingency payments based on
targeted future sales through September 2004. The maximum aggregate amount of
such contingency payments is approximately $2.0 million. During the June 2002
quarter, $0.7 million was recorded as compensation expense, as it was
determined that this amount of the contingency payments will be paid under the
agreement. The amount was paid during the December 2002 quarter.

Acquisition of Foster-Melliar’s Enterprise Security Management Division

On July 11, 2001, we acquired the enterprise security management division of
Foster-Melliar Limited, an IT services company located in Johannesburg, South
Africa. We paid approximately $1.5 million for these assets and the IT services
business. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase and we recorded
approximately $1.5 million of goodwill. Under the terms of the agreement, we
may also be liable for contingency payments based on targeted future sales
through fiscal year 2004. The maximum aggregate amount of such contingency
payments is $1.5 million. During the March 2003 and March 2002 quarters, an
amount of $0.5 million each was recorded as goodwill and

compensation expense,
respectively, as it was determined that these amounts of the contingency
payments will be paid under the agreement. An amount of $0.5 million remains as
an accrual as of March 31, 2003.

Acquisition of AXENT

On December 18, 2000, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of AXENT
Technologies, Inc. by issuing approximately 29,056,000 shares of our common
stock to AXENT shareholders. We also assumed all of the outstanding AXENT
employee stock options valued at approximately $87.0 million. A valuation
specialist used our estimates to establish the amount of acquired in-process
research and development. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase. The
acquisition was initially recorded during fiscal 2001 for approximately $924.7
million and was allocated as follows (in thousands):

During fiscal 2001, we also accrued approximately $18.3 million in acquisition
related expenses, which included financial advisory, legal and accounting,
duplicative site and fixed assets, and severance costs. These acquisition
related expenses were paid by the end of the December 2001 quarter.

After filing the pre-acquisition tax returns of AXENT during the December 2001
quarter, we identified additional tax losses and other beneficial tax
attributes available from the pre-acquisition periods of AXENT. As a result, we
recorded additional deferred tax assets of $5 million attributable to these
carryforward tax benefits, with a corresponding offset to goodwill.

During the September 2001 quarter, we divested the web access management
product line that we acquired with our acquisition of AXENT. As a result, we
wrote off approximately $0.8 million of net workforce-in-place related to this
product line (see

Divestiture of Web Access Management Product Line)

.

During the June 2001 quarter, we resolved certain pre-acquisition contingencies
related to the acquisition of AXENT, and as a result, we increased the purchase
price and goodwill by $4.5 million. The amount allocated to tradename,
workforce-in-place, developed technology and goodwill is being amortized over
their useful lives of four years. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we
recharacterized acquired workforce-in-place (and the related deferred tax
liability) as goodwill and ceased the amortization of goodwill on April 1,
2002. The unearned compensation related to the options assumed as part of the
acquisition is being amortized over the remaining vesting period.

Pro Forma.

The following unaudited pro forma information for fiscal 2003, 2002
and 2001 were as if the Riptech acquisition had occurred at the beginning of
each fiscal period presented. The pro forma information excludes approximately
$1.7 million (pre-tax) of amortization related to developed technology and
other intangible assets associated with the Riptech acquisition for fiscal
2003. In addition, the pro forma information excludes approximately $2.1
million (pre-tax) of acquired in-process research and development associated
with the Riptech acquisition for fiscal 2003. The pro forma information
excludes approximately $196.8 million (pre-tax) and $2.8 million (pre-tax) of
amortization related to goodwill and workforce-in-place, respectively,
associated with non-related acquisitions for fiscal 2002.

The pro forma information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and
is not indicative of what operating results would have been if the acquisition
had taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2002 or of future operating results.
Financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for Recourse was
not available due to insufficient record-keeping during the interim and annual
periods in fiscal 2002 and interim periods in 2003 and, as such, has not been
included in this pro forma information. Pro forma information for SecurityFocus
and Mountain Wave was not presented, as the SecurityFocus and Mountain Wave
acquisitions were deemed not significant.

Divestiture of the Web Access Management Product Line

On August 24, 2001, we sold assets and transferred liabilities and employees
related to our web access management product line to PassGo Technologies, Ltd
for approximately $1.1 million in cash, resulting in a pre-tax gain of
approximately $0.4 million on the divestiture, which was recorded in income,
net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

We also entered into an exclusive license and option agreement with PassGo
whereby they licensed our web access management technology products. In
consideration for the license, PassGo is required to pay us quarterly royalties
based on their net revenue starting at 30% and declining to 10% over a
four-year period. Because the royalties are not guaranteed and the quarterly
amounts to be received are not determinable until earned, we are recognizing
these royalties as payments are due. PassGo has an option to purchase the
technology at a price starting at $18.8 million and declining to $3.3 million
over a four-year period. These payments, if any, will be recorded in income,
net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines.

During fiscal 2003 and 2002, we recorded approximately $1.8 million and $1.1
million for the amortization of the developed technology related to the web
access management products in income, net of expense, from sale of technologies
and product lines. During the December 2002 quarter, we also wrote off
approximately $2.7 million of developed technology related to the web access
management products due to impairment.

Divestiture of ACT! Product Line

On December 31, 1999, we licensed substantially all of the ACT! product line
technology to Interact Commerce Corporation for a period of four years. In
addition, we sold the inventory and fixed assets related to the ACT! product
line to Interact. In consideration for the license and assets, Interact
transferred to us 623,247 shares of its unregistered common stock, valued at
approximately $20.0 million. During the March 2001 quarter, Interact entered
into a plan to merge with The Sage Group plc and we recorded a loss of
approximately $12.5 million as other expense on the Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Operations related to the other than temporary decline in value
of our investment in Interact. As a result of the merger, we received
approximately $7.5 million upon the surrender of the Interact shares in July
2001.

In addition to the shares received from Interact, Interact is required to pay
us quarterly royalty payments for four years. Interact will pay these royalties
based on future revenues set forth in the license, up to an aggregate maximum
of $57.0 million. Because the royalties are not guaranteed and the quarterly
amounts to be received are not determinable until earned, we are recognizing
these royalties as payments are due. We recorded approximately $10.5 million,
$15.5 million and $19.3 million of royalty payments during fiscal 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively, in income, net of expense, from sale of technologies
and product lines. At the end of the four-year period, Interact has the
exclusive option, for a period of 30 days, to purchase the licensed technology
from us for $60 million less all royalties paid to us to date.

Other Royalties and Transition Fees

In accordance with individual transition agreements, PassGo, and Interact paid
us royalties and/or fees for invoicing, collecting receivables, shipping and
other operational and support activities. We recorded approximately $0.8
million, $0.7 million and $0.8 million for these royalties and/or fees during
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, in income, net of expense, from sale
of technologies and product lines.

Divestiture of Electronic Forms

During September 1996, we sold our electronic forms software product line and
related tangible assets to JetForm Corporation, payable in installments through
the June 2000 quarter. We received installment payments from JetForm
of approximately $0.4 million during fiscal 2001. Due to the uncertainty
regarding the ultimate collectibility of these installments, we recognized the
related amounts as payments were due and collectibility was assured from
JetForm. Installment payments from JetForm were recorded in income, net of
expense, from sale of technologies and product lines.

Note 4. Goodwill, Acquired Product Rights and Other Intangible Assets

With the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we ceased the amortization of goodwill and
recharacterized acquired workforce-in-place (and the related deferred tax
liability) as goodwill on April 1, 2002. Accordingly, there was no amortization
of goodwill and acquired workforce-in-place during fiscal 2003.

The following table presents a reconciliation of previously reported net income
(loss) and net income (loss) per share to the amounts adjusted for the
exclusion of the amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce-in-place, net
of the related income tax effect:

For fiscal year 2003 and 2002, net income per share (diluted), as adjusted is
calculated using the if-converted method. Under this method, the numerator
excludes the interest expense from the 3% convertible subordinated notes, net
of income tax, of $14.4 million and $6.2 million for fiscal year 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis. We performed the initial
goodwill impairment test required by SFAS No. 142 during the June 2002 quarter
and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill recorded upon
implementation of SFAS No. 142. We also completed our annual goodwill
impairment test during the March 2003 quarter and determined that there was no
impairment of goodwill. We will continue to test for impairment during the
fourth quarter of each year, or earlier if indicators of impairment exist. In
connection with the September 2002 quarter acquisitions, we recorded
approximately $308.7 million of goodwill. Subsequently during the December 2002
quarter, we recorded goodwill adjustments of $1.2 million due to revised
estimates related to certain liabilities.

Acquired product rights and other intangible assets subject to amortization were as follows:

During fiscal 2003, we recorded approximately $42.7 million of product rights,
offset by a write-off of $2.7 million of developed technology related to the
web access management products that were divested during fiscal 2002. During
fiscal 2002, we recorded approximately $1.1 million of non-acquisition acquired
product rights, which was offset by a write-off of $0.8 million of net
workforce-in place related to the divestiture of our web access management
product line.

During fiscal 2003, amortization expense for acquired product rights was
approximately $32.1 million, of which $30.4 million and $1.8 million was
recorded in cost of revenues and income, net of expense, from sale of
technologies and product lines, respectively. During fiscal 2002, amortization
expense for acquired product rights was approximately $32.2, of which $31.1
million and $1.1 million was recorded in cost of revenues and income, net of
expense, from sale of technologies and product lines, respectively. During
fiscal 2001, amortization expense for acquired product rights was approximately
$17.3 million and was recorded in cost of revenues.

Amortization expense for other intangible assets (customer base, tradenames and
marketing-related assets) was $2.8 million, $2.1 million and $1.4 million
during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The estimated annual amortization expense for acquired product rights is $32.7
million, $23.7 million, $10.0 million, $5.6 million and $1.1 million for fiscal
year 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, based upon existing
acquired product rights. The estimated annual amortization expense for other
intangible assets is $2.6 million, $1.5 million, $0.5 million and $0.2 million
for fiscal year 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively, based upon existing
other intangible assets.

Note 5. Investments

Cash Equivalents, Short-term Investments and Trading Investments

All cash equivalents and short-term investments were classified as
available-for-sale securities, except for our trading securities. We maintain a
trading asset portfolio in connection with our executive deferred compensation
arrangements that consists of marketable equity securities, which had a fair
value of approximately $1.9 million and $1.1 million as of March 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively. Any activity related to these trading assets has a
corresponding effect on the carrying value of the related deferred compensation
liability. These trading assets have not been separately disclosed on the
balance sheet due to their immaterial amounts and were instead included in the
following tabular disclosures.

The estimated fair value of the cash equivalents and short-term investments consisted of the following:

Fair values of cash equivalents, short-term investments and trading assets
approximate cost primarily due to the short-term maturities of the investments
and the absence of changes in security credit ratings.

As of March 31, 2003 and 2002, we held no publicly traded equity securities. As
of March 31, 2001, equity securities of approximately $7.5 million consisted of
623,247 shares of Interact. During the March 2001 quarter, Interact entered
into a plan to merge with The Sage Group plc and we recorded a loss of
approximately $12.5 million as other expense related to the other than
temporary decline in value of our investment in Interact. As a result of the
merger, we received approximately $7.5 million upon the surrender of the
Interact shares in July 2001.

Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were reported as a
component of stockholders’ equity and were approximately $1.7 million and $0.7
million as of March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Unregistered Equity Investments

As of March 31, 2003 and 2002, we held equity investments with a carrying value
of approximately $10.5 million in six privately held companies and $8.4 million
in three privately held companies, respectively. These investments were
recorded at cost as we do not have significant influence over the investee and
are classified as other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

During the September 2002 and March 2001 quarters, we recognized a decline in
value of approximately $0.8 million and $12.6 million, respectively, determined
to be other than temporary on certain privately held investments. Also during
the March 2001 quarter, we recorded a gain of approximately $0.9 million on
another investment, as a result of this privately held company being acquired
by another entity. This investment was acquired as a result of our acquisition
of AXENT. The other than temporary decline in value and gain on investments
were recorded as other expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued

Derivative Financial Instruments

During the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements, we did not
use any derivative instrument for trading purposes. We utilize some natural
hedging to mitigate our exposures and we manage certain residual balance sheet
exposures through the use of one-month forward foreign exchange contracts. We
enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions
primarily to minimize currency exchange risks associated with certain balance
sheet positions. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts
approximates cost due to the short maturity periods. As of March 31, 2003, the
notional amount of our forward foreign exchange contracts was approximately
$67.3 million, all of which mature in 35 days or less. We do not hedge our
foreign currency translation risk.

Note 6. Convertible Subordinated Notes

On October 24, 2001, we completed a private offering of $600.0 million of 3%
convertible subordinated notes due November 1, 2006, the net proceeds of which
were approximately $584.6 million. The notes are convertible into shares of our
common stock by the holders at any time before maturity at a conversion price
of $34.14 per share, subject to certain adjustments. During fiscal 2003, an
immaterial principal amount of our notes were converted into shares of our
common stock. We may redeem the remaining notes on or after November 5, 2004,
at a redemption price of 100.75% of stated principal during the period November
5, 2004 through October 31, 2005 and 100% thereafter. Interest is paid
semi-annually and we commenced making these payments on May 1, 2002. Debt
issuance costs of approximately $15.8 million, related to the notes, is
amortized on a straight-line basis through November 1, 2006. We have reserved
approximately 17.6 million shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion
of the notes.

Note 7. Commitments

We lease certain of our facilities and equipment under operating leases that
expire at various dates through 2018. We currently sublease some space under
various operating leases that will expire at various dates through 2013.

thereafter, respectively.

Rent expense charged to operations totaled approximately $28.8 million, $25.2
million and $22.9 million during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In March 2003, we terminated our operating lease obligations for four
facilities located in Cupertino, California, Springfield, Oregon, and Newport
News, Virginia by purchasing the land and buildings for approximately $17.9
million and $106.0 million, respectively.

Note 8. Stock Split

On December 14, 2001, the Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split
of Symantec’s common stock effected as a stock dividend, which became effective
as of January 31, 2002 to stockholders of record on January 17, 2002. Based on
the number of shares outstanding on January 17, 2002, the stock dividend
resulted in the issuance of approximately 70.7 million additional shares of
Symantec’s common stock. All Symantec share and per share amounts in prior
periods have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the stock dividend.

Note 9. Common Stock Repurchases

On January 16, 2001, the Board of Directors replaced an earlier stock
repurchase program with a new authorization to repurchase up to $700.0 million
of Symantec common stock, not to exceed 30.0 million shares, with no expiration
date. As of March 31, 2003, we had repurchased a total of 21.9 million shares
under this program at prices ranging from $17.78 to $29.97 per share, for an
aggregate amount of approximately $513.2 million. During fiscal 2003, we
repurchased 2.2 million shares at prices ranging from $27.93 to $29.97 per
share, for an aggregate amount of approximately $64.3 million. During fiscal
2002, we repurchased 9.6 million shares at prices ranging from $17.78 to $24.50
per share, for an aggregate amount of approximately $204.4 million. During
fiscal 2001, we repurchased 10.0 million shares at prices ranging from $23.04
to $25.58 per share, for an aggregate amount of approximately $244.4 million.

The components of net income (loss) per share were as follows:

During fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, approximately 0.7 million, 13.8 million and
8.3 million shares, respectively, issuable from assumed exercise of options
were excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share, as
the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

During fiscal 2002, approximately 7.6 million shares issuable upon conversion
of the 3% convertible subordinated notes were excluded from the computation of
diluted net income (loss) per share, as their effect would have been
anti-dilutive.

Note 11. Adoption of Stockholder Rights Plan

On August 11, 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan
designed to ensure orderly consideration of any future unsolicited acquisition
attempt to ensure fair value of us for our stockholders.

In connection with the plan, the Board of Directors declared and paid a
dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of Symantec
common stock outstanding on the record date, August 21, 1998. Each right
entitles the holder, under certain circumstances, to purchase from us one
two-thousandth of a share of our Series A Junior



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued

Participating Preferred Stock,
par value $0.01 per share, at a price of $150.00 per one one-thousandth of a
share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment.

The rights are initially attached to Symantec common stock and will not trade
separately. If a person or a group, an Acquiring Person, acquires 20% or more
of our common stock, or announces an intention to make a tender offer for 20%
or more of our common stock, the rights will be distributed and will thereafter
trade separately from the common stock.

If the rights become exercisable, each right (other than rights held by the
Acquiring Person) will entitle the holder to purchase, at a price equal to the
exercise price of the right, a number of shares of our common stock having a
then-current value of twice the exercise price of the right. If, after the
rights become exercisable, we agree to merge into another entity or we sell
more than 50% of our assets, each right will entitle the holder to purchase, at
a price equal to the exercise price of the right, a number of shares of common
stock of such entity having a then-current value of twice the exercise price.

We may exchange the rights at a ratio of one share of common stock for each
right (other than the Acquiring Person) at any time after an Acquiring Person
acquires 20% or more of our common stock but before such person acquires 50% or
more of our common stock. We may also redeem the rights at our option at a
price of $0.001 per right at any time before an Acquiring Person has acquired
20% or more of our common stock. The rights will expire on August 12, 2008.

Note 12. Employee Benefits

401(k) Plan

We maintain a salary deferral 401(k) plan for all of our domestic employees.
This plan allows employees to contribute up to 20% of their pretax salary up to
the maximum dollar limitation prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. We match
100% of the first $500 of employees’ contributions and then 50% of the
employees’ contribution. The maximum employer match in any given plan year is
3% of the employees’ eligible compensation. Our contributions under the plan
were approximately $3.9 million, $4.1 million and $3.0 million during fiscal
2003, 2002 and 2001.

Restricted Shares

During fiscal 1999, we issued 200,000 restricted shares to our current CEO for
a purchase price of $0.005 per share, vesting 50% at each anniversary date,
with the first anniversary date being April 14, 2000. Unearned compensation
equivalent to the market value of the common stock on the date of grant, less
par, was charged to stockholders’ equity and was amortized into compensation
expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting term. As of March 31, 2003,
there were 200,000 shares fully vested and outstanding.

Stock Purchase Plans

In September 2002, our stockholders approved the 2002 Executive Officers’ Stock
Purchase Plan and reserved 250,000 shares of common stock for issuance. The
purpose of the plan is to provide executive officers with a convenient means to
acquire an equity interest in Symantec at fair market value by applying a
portion or all of their respective bonus payments towards the purchase price.
Each executive officer may purchase up to 10,000 shares in any fiscal year. As
of March 31, 2003, no shares have been issued under the plan.

In September 1998, our stockholders approved the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan and reserved a total of 1.0 million shares of common stock for issuance.
The plan was subsequently amended by our stockholders on September 15, 1999, to
increase the shares available for issuance by approximately 1.5 million shares
and to add an “evergreen” provision whereby the number of shares available for
issuance increases automatically on January 1 of each year (beginning in 2000)
by 1% of our outstanding shares of common stock on each immediately preceding
December 31 during the term of the plan, provided that the aggregate number of
shares issued over the term of the plan does not exceed 16.0 million shares. A
total of approximately 8.1 million shares of common stock has been reserved
under the plan including an automatic increase of approximately 1.5 million,
1.4 million, 1.5 million and 1.2 million shares on January 1, 2003, 2002, 2001,
and 2000 respectively. Subject to certain limitations, our employees may
purchase, through payroll deductions of 2% to 10% of their compensation, shares
of common stock at a price per share that is the lesser of 85% of the fair
market value as of the beginning of the offering period or the end of the
purchase period. As of March 31, 2003, approximately 2.6 million shares had
been issued and 5.5 million shares remain available under the plan.

Stock Award Plans

In September 2000, our stockholders approved the 2000 Directors Equity
Incentive Plan and reserved 50,000 shares of common stock for issuance under
this plan. The purpose of this plan is to provide the members of the Board of
Directors with an opportunity to receive common stock for all or a portion of
the retainer payable to each director
for serving as a member. Each director may elect to receive 50% to 100% of the
retainer to be paid in the form of stock. As of March 31, 2003, a total of
approximately 22,000 shares had been issued under this plan.

In January 1995, the Board of Directors approved the terms of the 1994 Patent
Incentive Plan. The purpose of this plan is to increase awareness of the
importance of patents to our business and to provide employees with incentives
to pursue patent protection for new technologies that may be valuable to us.
Our executive officers are not eligible for awards under the 1994 Patent
Incentive Plan, and no employee is eligible to receive more than 100,000 shares
of common stock at any time during the term of the plan. The Board of Directors
reserved 800,000 shares of common stock for issuance under this plan. As of
March 31, 2003, a total of approximately 59,000 shares had been issued under
this plan.

Stock awards issued under these stock award plans are recorded as compensation
expense.

Stock Option Plans

We maintain stock option plans pursuant to which an aggregate total of
approximately 83.0 million shares of common stock have been reserved for
issuance as incentive and nonqualified stock options to employees, officers,
directors, consultants, independent contractors and advisors to us, or of any
parent, subsidiary or affiliate of Symantec as the Board of Directors or
committee may determine. The purpose of these plans is to attract, retain and
motivate eligible persons whose present and potential contributions are
important to our success by offering them an opportunity to participate in our
future performance through awards of stock options and stock bonuses. Under the
terms of these plans, the option exercise price may not be less than 100% of
the fair market value on the date of grant and the options have a maximum term
of ten years and generally vests over a four-year period.

In January 2001, the Board of Directors approved the terms of the 2001
Non-Qualified Equity Incentive Plan, under which we grant options to employees,
officers, directors, consultants, independent contractors and advisors to us,
or of any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of Symantec as the Board of Directors
or committee may determine. Options awarded to insiders, defined as officers,
directors or other persons subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, may not exceed in the aggregate fifty (50%) percent of all shares that
are available for grant under the plan and employees of the company who are not
insiders must receive at least fifty (50%) percent of all shares that are
available for grant under the plan. The terms of this plan are similar to those
of our 1996 Equity Incentive Plan, except that it was adopted, and may be
amended, without stockholder approval. The Board of Directors reserved 6.0
million shares of common stock for issuance under the plan. As of March 31,
2003, approximately 1.7 million options were outstanding under this plan.

In December 2000, as a result of our acquisition of AXENT, we assumed all
outstanding AXENT stock options. Each AXENT stock option assumed by us is
exercisable for one share of Symantec common stock for each one share of AXENT
common stock that was previously subject to the option, at the same exercise
price. Each option is otherwise subject to the same terms and conditions as the
original grant and generally vests over four years and expires ten years from
the date of grant. No further options may be granted under the AXENT plans. As
of March 31, 2003, approximately 452,000 options were outstanding.

In July 1999, the Board of Directors approved the terms of the 1999 Acquisition
Plan. Options awarded to officers may not exceed in the aggregate thirty (30%)
percent of all shares that are available for grant under the plan. The terms of
this plan are similar to those of our 1996 Equity Incentive Plan, except that
it was adopted, and may be amended, without stockholder approval. The Board of
Directors reserved 1.0 million shares of common stock for issuance under the
plan. As of March 31, 2003, approximately 213,000 options were outstanding
under this plan.

In accordance with the employment agreement dated April 11, 1999 between our
current CEO and Symantec, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of a
non-qualified stock option to acquire 400,000 shares of common stock to the
CEO. The option was granted at 100% of the fair market value on the date of
grant, has a term life of ten years and vests over a five-year period. As of
March 31, 2003, all 400,000 options were outstanding.

On December 20, 1999 a non-qualified option to acquire 40,000 shares was
approved for grant to the CEO and was deemed granted on January 1, 2000. The
option was granted at 100% of the fair market value on the date of grant,



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued

has a
term life of ten years and vests 25% on the first anniversary of the date of
grant and 2.0833% each month thereafter. As of March 31, 2003, all 40,000
options were outstanding.

In May 1996, our stockholders approved the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan and
subsequently approved amendments to increase the number of shares of common
stock reserved for issuance under the plan to a total of approximately 48.9
million shares, including approximately 6.4 million, 7.2 million and 4.8
million shares approved on September 12, 2002, September 12, 2001 and December
15, 2000, respectively. As of March 31, 2003, approximately 20.7 million
options were outstanding under this plan.

As of March 31, 2003, of the approximately 24.6 million shares reserved under
the 1988 Employee Stock Option Plan, which was superseded by the 1996 Equity
Incentive Plan, approximately 111,000 options remain outstanding. Furthermore,
of the 900,000 shares reserved under the 1993 Directors Stock Option Plan,
31,000 options remain outstanding. No further options may be granted under
these plans.

These options will expire if not exercised by specific dates through March

ranged from $2.81 to $40.19.

We elected to follow APB No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, in
accounting for our employee stock options because the alternative fair value
accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

, requires the use of option valuation models that were not
developed for use in valuing employee stock options. Under APB No. 25, because
the exercise price of our employee stock options generally equals the market
price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is
recognized in our consolidated financial statements.

Pro forma information regarding net income (loss) and net income (loss) per
share is required by SFAS No. 123. This information is required to be
determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options, including
shares issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, collectively called
“options,” granted subsequent to March 31, 1995 under the fair value method of
that statement. The fair value of options granted during fiscal 2003, 2002 and
2001 reported below has been estimated at the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model assuming no expected dividends and the
following weighted average assumptions:

The weighted average estimated fair values of employee stock options granted
during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $22.36, $20.66 and $12.70
per share, respectively. The weighted average estimated fair value of employee
stock purchase rights granted under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 were approximately $17.85, $14.56 and $10.53,
respectively.

For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of the options
was amortized to expense over the options’ vesting period, for employee stock
options, and the six-month purchase period, for stock purchases under the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Options assumed as a result of our acquisition of
AXENT were not included in the estimated fair value. Shares purchased through
the AXENT Purchase Plan subsequent to the closing date of the AXENT acquisition

During the March 2003 quarter, we recorded approximately $3.4 million for the
costs of severance, related benefits and outplacement services primarily
associated with the relocation of certain development, sales and finance
activities and the realignment of certain worldwide marketing efforts. As a
result, we terminated 122 employees. In addition, we recorded approximately
$3.0 million for exit costs associated with the consolidation of certain
facilities in the United States. As of March 31, 2003, we had an accrual of
approximately $3.2 million outstanding related to severance, benefits and
outplacement services, and $1.5 million related to rent and related exit costs
of the facilities.

During the September 2002 quarter, we recorded approximately $0.7 million for
the costs of severance, related benefits and outplacement services associated
with the reduction in operations of our San Antonio, Texas site. As a result,
we terminated 51 employees. As of March 31, 2003, all costs have been paid with
the exception of an immaterial amount related to outplacement service charges.

During the June 2002 quarter, we recorded approximately $6.1 million for costs
of severance, related benefits, outplacement services and abandonment of
certain fixed assets primarily associated with the restructuring and relocation
of our Leiden, Netherlands operations to Dublin, Ireland and the outsourcing of
our North American and European consumer support functions. As a result of this
relocation, we terminated 251 employees. This estimate was subsequently revised
in the September 2002 quarter, resulting in a reduction in severance, related
benefits and outplacement services accrual by approximately $0.9 million. As of
March 31, 2003, we had an accrual of approximately $0.1 million outstanding
related to severance, related benefits and outplacement service charges.

During the March 2002 quarter, we recorded approximately $8.1 million for exit
costs associated with the expansion of our Newport News, Virginia site to a
larger facility in Newport News, consolidation of most of our United Kingdom
facilities to Maidenhead, UK, and relocation of our Leiden, Netherlands
operations to Dublin, Ireland, in efforts to consolidate our European support
functions. These costs included approximately $5.8 million in rent remaining on
the abandoned facilities and related exit costs, and $2.3 million in related
abandoned fixed asset and leasehold improvement write-offs. These estimates
were subsequently revised in the March 2003, December 2002 and September 2002
quarters, resulting in a net reduction in the facility related accrual by
approximately $0.3 million, ($0.4) million and ($1.2) million, respectively. As
of March 31, 2003, we had an accrual of approximately $2.8 million outstanding
related to rent and exit costs of the facilities.

Also during the March 2002 quarter, we recorded approximately $1.0 million for
the costs of severance, related benefits and outplacement services, as we
reorganized various operating functions. As a result, we terminated 29
employees. As of September 30, 2002, all costs had been paid with the exception
of an immaterial amount for related outplacement services.

During the December 2001 quarter, we recorded approximately $9.4 million for
exit costs associated with the relocation of our North American support group
from Eugene, Oregon to an expanded facility in Springfield, Oregon. These costs
included approximately $6.7 million in rent remaining on the abandoned
facilities in Eugene, Oregon and related exit costs, and $2.7 million in
related abandoned leasehold improvement write-offs. These estimates were
subsequently revised in the September 2002 quarter, resulting in an increase in
the facility related accrual by approximately $0.2 million. As of March 31,
2003, we had an accrual of approximately $4.4 million outstanding related to
rent and related exit costs of the facilities.

During the June 2001 quarter, we recorded approximately $2.0 million for the
costs of employee severance, related benefits, outplacement services and
abandonment of certain facilities primarily related to various restructurings
as we continued the integration of AXENT into our operations. As a result, we
terminated 58 employees. These
severance, related benefits, and outplacement costs were paid by the end of the
September 2001 quarter. As of December 31, 2002, all costs have been paid with
the exception of an immaterial amount related to the abandoned facilities.

the costs of severance, related benefits and outplacement services. In
addition, we provided approximately $1.2 million for costs of severance and
related benefits for six members of our senior management due to a realignment
of certain responsibilities. These severance, related benefits, and
outplacement costs were paid by the end of the September 2001 quarter.

During the December 2000 quarter, we reduced a portion of our operations in
Toronto, thereby terminating 10 employees, and recorded approximately $400,000
for the costs of severance, related benefits and abandonment of certain
equipment. In addition, approximately $900,000 was provided for costs of
severance and related benefits for four members of our senior management due to
a realignment of certain responsibilities. These severance and related benefits
were paid by the end of the March 2001 quarter.

The exit plans associated with each of the reductions in workforce and facility
closures above specifically identified all the significant actions, including:

•

the names of individuals who would not continue employment with us;

•

the termination dates and severance packages for each terminating employee;

•

the date we would vacate the facilities which were under existing operating leases; and

•

the specific excess equipment, furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements to be disposed.

Employee severance and outplacement was primarily comprised of severance
packages for employees who were terminated as a result of the restructurings.
As part of each restructuring, we specifically identified those individuals who
would not continue employment with us. The severance periods ranged from one to
six months. The total cost of the severance packages was accrued and included
in a restructuring charge after the identified employees had their severance
packages communicated to them. Additionally, we accrued estimated costs
associated with outplacement services to be provided to terminating employees,
as these costs have no future economic benefit to us. The remaining accrual as
of March 31, 2003 was primarily for outstanding severance, benefits and
outplacement costs and will be paid by the first quarter of fiscal 2004.

Excess facilities and equipment included 1) remaining lease payments associated
with building leases subsequent to their abandonment dates, 2) net of estimated
sublease income, and/or 3) estimated lease termination costs. The cash outlays
for these leases are to be made over the remaining term of each lease, unless a
lease termination payment is required. In addition, we wrote off the carrying
value of site-specific equipment, furniture, fixtures and leasehold
improvements, which would no longer be utilized. The accrual as of March 31,
2003 relates primarily to the remaining lease payments, net of estimated
sublease income, which will be paid over the remaining lease term subsequent to
the abandonment of each facility through fiscal year 2007.

SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued

Realization of a significant portion of approximately $100.3 million of net
deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future
taxable income and the implementation of tax planning strategies. We believe it
is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized based
on historical earnings, expected levels of future taxable income in the U.S.
and certain foreign jurisdictions, and the implementation of tax planning
strategies. The valuation allowance remained unchanged during fiscal 2003 and
2002.

As of March 31, 2003, we have tax credit carryforwards of approximately $8.7
million that expire in fiscal 2004 through 2008. In addition, we have net
operating loss carryforwards attributable to various acquired companies of
approximately $111.4 million that expire in fiscal 2011 through 2022. These net
operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Internal
Revenue Code §382, but are expected to be fully realized.

Pretax income from international operations was approximately $225.4 million,
$168.4 million and $144.9 million for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

No provision has been made for federal or state income taxes on approximately
$490.6 million of cumulative unremitted earnings of certain of our foreign
subsidiaries as of March 31, 2003, since we plan to indefinitely reinvest these
earnings. As of March 31, 2003, the unrecognized deferred tax liability for
these earnings was approximately $127.6 million.

Note 15. Litigation

On March 28, 2003, Ronald Pearce filed a lawsuit on behalf of himself and
purportedly on behalf of the general public of the United States and Canada in
the California Superior Court, Santa Clara County, alleging violations of
California Business and Professions Code section 17200 and false advertising in
connection with our WinFax Pro product. The complaint seeks damages and
injunctive and other equitable relief, as well as costs and attorney fees. We
intend to defend the action vigorously.

On February 27, 2003, PowerQuest Corporation filed a lawsuit against us in the
United States District Court, District of Utah, alleging that our Ghost product
infringes a patent owned by them. The complaint seeks damages and injunctive
relief. We intend to defend the action vigorously.

On February 7, 2003, Cathy Baker filed a lawsuit against us, Microsoft and two
retailers in the California Superior Court, Marin County, purportedly on behalf
of the general public of California and of a class of certain purchasers of
software products. An amended complaint filed in May 2003 adds Greg Johnson as
plaintiff and Adobe Systems and another retailer as defendants. The complaint
alleges that our refund policies violate consumer warranty and unfair business
practice laws. The lawsuit seeks damages, rescission and injunctive relief, as
well as costs and attorney fees. We intend to defend the action vigorously.

On November 29, 2002, William Pereira filed a purported class action lawsuit
against a local retailer and us in the Supreme Court of New York, New York
County, alleging breach of contract and deceptive business practices in
connection with rebates offered by us. The complaint was served March 26, 2003.
The complaint seeks damages, costs and attorney fees. We intend to defend the
action vigorously.

On June 14, 2002, Hark Chan and Techsearch LLC filed a lawsuit against us in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of California,
alleging that unspecified products sold on CD-ROM with Internet hyperlinks
and/or with the LiveUpdate feature infringe a patent owned by Techsearch.
Subsequently, IP Innovation LLC was added as a plaintiff. The lawsuit requests
damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorney fees. We intend to defend the
action vigorously.

In May 2002, Craig Hughes filed a lawsuit in Utah state court, purportedly on
behalf of a class of persons located in Utah who he asserts received
unsolicited commercial email from us. The complaint alleges violation of Utah’s
recently enacted Unsolicited Commercial Email Act. The lawsuit requests
damages, costs and attorney fees. In January 2003, the parties to the lawsuit
submitted to the court a stipulated request for dismissal.

On December 23, 1999, Altiris Inc. filed a lawsuit against us in the United
States District Court, District of Utah, alleging that unspecified Symantec
products including Norton Ghost Enterprise Edition, infringed a patent owned by
Altiris. The lawsuit requests damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorney
fees. In October 2001, a stipulated judgment of non-infringement was entered
following the court’s ruling construing the claims of the Altiris patent, and
in February 2003, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the
judgment and remanded the case. We intend to defend the action vigorously.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued

In July 1998, the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division) ruled that we
should pay a total of approximately $4.7 million for damages, plus interest, to
Triolet Systems, Inc. and Brian Duncombe in a decade-old copyright action, for
damages arising from the grant of a preliminary injunction against them. The
damages were awarded following the court’s ruling that evidence presented later
in the case showed the injunction was not warranted. We inherited this case
through our acquisition of Delrina Corporation, which was the plaintiff in this
lawsuit. Our appeal of the decision was denied, and our request for further
review of that decision was also denied. We recorded a charge of approximately
$5.8 million during the June 1998 quarter, representing the unaccrued portion
of the judgment plus costs, and an additional charge of approximately $3.1
million for post-judgment interest and other costs during the March 2002
quarter. In January 2003, we paid the judgment, interest and costs of
approximately $7.4 million. We expect to pay the remaining accrued balance of
costs upon further determination by the court. As of March 31, 2003, we believe
that we have adequately accrued for both the damages and costs.

In October 1997, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for
the District of Utah on behalf of PowerQuest Corporation, against Quarterdeck,
which we acquired in March 1999. The complaint alleges that Quarterdeck’s
partitioning software, included in Partition-It and Partition-It Extra
Strength, violated a patent held by PowerQuest. In January 1998, PowerQuest
obtained a second patent relating to partitioning and has amended its complaint
to allege infringement of that patent as well. The plaintiff has added us as a
defendant and seeks an injunction against distribution of the Partition-It and
Partition-It Extra Strength products and monetary damages. We intend to defend
the action vigorously.

On September 15, 1997, Hilgraeve Corporation filed a lawsuit in the United
States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, against us, alleging that
unspecified Symantec products infringe a patent owned by Hilgraeve. The lawsuit
requests damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorney fees. In March 2000,
the court granted our summary judgment motions and dismissed the case. In
September 2001, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the
summary judgment and ordered the case returned to the District Court. We intend
to defend the action vigorously.

Over the past few years, it has become common for software companies, including
us, to receive claims of patent infringement. At any given time, we are
evaluating claims of patent infringement asserted by several parties, with
respect to certain of our products. The outcome of any related litigation or
negotiation could have a material adverse impact on our future results of
operations or cash flows.

We are also involved in a number of other judicial and administrative
proceedings that are incidental to our business. We intend to defend all of the
aforementioned pending lawsuits vigorously. Although adverse decisions (or
settlements) may occur in one or more of the cases, and it is not possible to
estimate the possible loss or losses from each of these cases, the final
resolution of these lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected
to have a material adverse affect on our financial condition. Depending,
however, on the amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution of these
lawsuits, it is possible that our future results of operations or cash flows
could be materially adversely affected in a particular period. We have accrued
certain estimated legal fees and expenses related to certain of these matters;
however, actual amounts may differ materially from those estimated amounts.

The total amount of legal and settlement expenses accrued as of the respective
year-ends, and the amounts expensed for the years then ended, were as follows:

Balance as of March 31, 2003

$6.4 million

Amount expensed during fiscal 2003

$11.8 million

Balance as of March 31, 2002

$12.5 million

Amount expensed during fiscal 2002

$9.0 million

Balance as of March 31, 2001

$  8.4 million

Amount expensed during fiscal 2001

$3.4 million

The legal expenses accrued by us are deemed probable because the lawsuits have
been filed, management has determined its plans of action with regards to the
cases and, accordingly, knows that it will incur legal expenses related to the
particular lawsuit. Utilizing the assumptions noted in

Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

under

Legal Expenses

, management is able to estimate a
minimum amount of legal fees to be incurred in these lawsuits.

Note 16. Segment Information

Our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer
different products and services, distinguished by customer needs. We have five
operating segments: Enterprise Security, Enterprise Administration, Consumer
Products, Services and Other.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued

The Enterprise Security segment focuses on providing Internet security
technology, global response and services necessary for organizations to manage
their information security needs. The Enterprise Administration segment offers
products that enable companies to be more effective and efficient within their
information technology departments. The Consumer Products segment focuses on
delivering our security and problem-solving products to individual users, home
offices and small businesses. The Services segment is focused on providing
information security solutions that incorporate best-of-breed technology,
security expertise and global resources. The Other segment is comprised of
sunset products and products nearing the end of their life cycle. Also included
in the Other segment are all indirect costs, general and administrative
expenses, amortization of goodwill (through March 31, 2002) and other
intangible assets, debt issuance costs and other assets and charges, such as
acquired in-process research and development, legal judgments and settlements
and restructuring and site closures which are not charged to the other
operating segments.

We shifted our focus to these operating segments during fiscal 2000, with
additional realignment in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001. Due to this change, we
have presented the fiscal 2002 and 2001 segment information to conform to our
current segments. In addition, we have appropriately presented the
amortization of other intangible assets by segment for fiscal 2002.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting polices, with the exception of the
amortization of acquired product rights, which is included entirely in our
Other segment. There are no intersegment sales. Our chief operating decision
maker evaluates performance based on direct profit or loss from operations
before income taxes not including nonrecurring gains and losses, foreign
exchange gains and losses and miscellaneous other income and expenses. The
majority of our assets and liabilities are not discretely allocated or reviewed
by segment. The depreciation and amortization of our property, equipment and
leasehold improvements are allocated based on headcount, unless specifically
identified by segment.

Note 17. Reclassifications of Previously Reported Financial Information

We have reclassified certain previously reported amounts to conform to the
current presentation format with no impact on net income (loss).

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we recharacterized acquired workforce-in-place
and the related deferred tax liability as goodwill. For comparative purposes,
we have reclassified the related balances as of March 31, 2002 in the
consolidated balance sheet and in Note 1, Note 4 and Note 16 (

Geographical

.

We also reclassified from other accrued expenses to other long-term obligations
the long-term portion of certain lease payments related to facilities abandoned
during the March 2002 quarter. We have reclassified the related balances as of
March 31, 2002 in the consolidated balance sheet.

Subsequent to March 31, 2002, we revised our methodology for allocating certain
costs, including the allocation of technical support costs between sales and
marketing expenses and cost of revenues and the allocation of certain general
and administrative expenses between cost of revenues and operating expenses. As
a result, we have reclassified the related balances for the years ended March
31, 2002 and 2001 in the consolidated statements of operations and in Note 2.

complete the acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.
