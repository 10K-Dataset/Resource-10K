PART I

Item 1.

Business

Symantec is a global leader in providing security, storage and
    systems management solutions to help businesses and consumers
    secure and manage their information. We provide customers
    worldwide with software and services that protect, manage and
    control information risks related to security, data protection,
    storage, compliance, and systems management. We help our
    customers manage cost, complexity and compliance by protecting
    their IT infrastructure as they seek to maximize value from
    their IT investments.

We deliver a comprehensive and diverse set of security and
    availability products and services to large enterprises,
    governments, small and medium-sized businesses, and consumers on
    a worldwide basis. Our delivery network includes direct, inside,
    and channel sales resources that support our ecosystem of more
    than 44,000 partners worldwide, as well as various relationships
    with original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, Internet service
    providers, or ISPs, and retail and online stores. We operate in
    three geographic regions: Americas, which includes United
    States, Canada, and Latin America; EMEA, which includes Europe,
    Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific Japan (APJ).

We operate primarily in two growing, diversified markets within
    the software sector: the security market and the storage
    software market. The security market includes products that
    protect consumers and enterprises from threats to endpoint
    devices, computer networks, and electronic information. Over the
    past several years, we have seen security threats continue to
    evolve from traditional viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other
    vulnerabilities, and more recently from threats such as phishing
    (attacks that use spoofed websites and emails designed to record
    keystrokes or to deceive recipients into divulging personal
    financial data), email fraud, and identity theft. We have also
    seen security rise to a top priority for enterprises as
    information security is increasingly linked to regulatory
    compliance. This evolution is a key driver of our research and
    development and acquisition strategies, as we strive to
    differentiate our solutions from the competition and address our
    customers’ changing needs.

The storage software market includes products that manage,
    archive, protect, and recover business-critical data. We believe
    that the security and storage software markets are converging as
    customers increasingly require our help in mitigating their risk
    profiles and managing their storage solutions in order to secure
    and manage their most valuable asset — their
    information. The worldwide storage software market consists of
    storage management, server and application management, backup
    and archiving, and infrastructure software products and
    services. Key drivers of demand in this market include the
    ever-increasing quantity of data being collected, the need for
    data to be protected, recoverable, and accessible at all times,
    and the need for a growing number of critical applications to be
    continuously available and highly performing.

Other factors driving demand in these markets include the
    increase in the number of Internet users, computing devices, and
    companies conducting business online, the continuous automation
    of business processes, the on-going desire of organizations to
    manage their overall IT risk, the increasing pressure on
    companies to lower storage and server management costs while
    simultaneously increasing the utilization, availability levels,
    and performance of their existing IT infrastructure, and the
    increasing importance of document retention and regulatory
    compliance solutions.

In the ever-changing threat landscape and increasingly complex
    IT environment for consumers and enterprises alike, we believe
    product differentiation will be the key to sustaining market
    leadership. Thus, we continually work to enhance the features
    and functionality of our existing products, extend our product
    leadership, and create innovative solutions for our customers.
    We focus on generating profitable and sustainable growth through
    internal research and development, licensing from third parties,
    and acquisitions of companies with leading technologies.

Business
    Developments and Highlights

During fiscal 2008, we took the following actions to support our
    business:

•

We developed and launched several new products and integrated
    new feature functionality into new versions of products across
    our offerings. As a result, customers are leveraging our broader
    product portfolio to help them secure and manage their critical
    asset — information. Some of the new offerings in our
    enterprise



business include: an integrated single agent to manage endpoint
    protection that incorporates compliance functionality; a single
    solution for centralized, end-to-end management of backup
    environments as well as adding data de-duplication and
    continuous disk-based backup capability; data protection for
    archiving that includes a simple, easy-to-manage online storage
    option via our software-as-a-service platform; a standardized
    storage management solution for heterogeneous environments that
    simplifies data center infrastructure; an integrated data loss
    prevention solution that combines endpoint and network-back
    technology to prevent the loss of confidential data wherever it
    is used or stored; and, the integration of endpoint security and
    Windows-based backup, which includes process workflow and
    automation functionality, based on the Altiris web
    services-based architecture. In our consumer business, we
    delivered stronger protection against web-based attacks as well
    as password and identity management tools.

•

We formed a joint venture with Huawei, Technologies Co., Ltd to
    develop and manufacture security and storage appliances for
    global telecommunications carriers and enterprise customers. See
    Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
    this annual report for more information.

•

We completed three acquisitions during fiscal 2008, Altiris,
    Inc., Vontu, Inc., and Transparent Logic Technologies, Inc. In
    addition, during fiscal 2009, we acquired AppStream, Inc. These
    acquisitions add new products as well as enhance our product
    portfolio with additional features and capabilities. See
    Note 4 and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in this annual report for more information.

•

We sold the Application Performance Management (APM) business
    because we determined that APM was not a focus area that aligned
    with our long-term strategic direction. See Note 6 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report
    for more information.

•

We reduced our cost structure in order to better align expenses
    with revenue expectations.

•

We made the following key additions and changes to our executive
    management team:

•

We announced the appointment of Enrique Salem as Chief Operating
    Officer responsible for product development, sales, services,
    marketing and IT. Mr. Salem will be focusing on improving
    operations by leveraging our broad portfolio of technology and
    services across the businesses, while ensuring the sales and
    services teams are executing on our product initiatives.

•

We realigned the enterprise product groups to improve cross
    product line collaboration and drive better operating results.
    The enterprise product line leaders of the Security and
    Compliance group and Storage and Server Management group report
    directly to Mr. Salem.

•

Greg Hughes was named Chief Strategy Officer responsible for
    strategy and corporate development. Mr. Hughes will be
    focusing on emerging growth areas, such as our Symantec
    Protection Network, our software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform,
    as well as identifying and investing in new business models and
    go-to-market strategies.

•

We repurchased 81 million shares of our common stock for an
    aggregate amount of $1.5 billion.

Founded in 1982, Symantec has grown to approximately
    $5.9 billion in revenue in fiscal 2008, positioning
    Symantec as the fourth largest independent software company in
    the world based on revenue. We have operations in more than 40
    countries and our principal executive offices are located at
    20330 Stevens Creek Blvd., Cupertino, California 95014. Our
    telephone number at that location is

(408) 517-8000.

Operating
    Segments and Products

Our operating segments are significant strategic business units
    that offer different products and services, distinguished by
    customer needs. During most of fiscal 2008, we had six operating
    segments: Consumer Products, Security and Data Management, Data
    Center Management, Services, Altiris, and Other. The Other
    segment is comprised of sunset products and products nearing the
    end of their life cycle and also includes general and
    administrative expenses; amortization of acquired product
    rights, other intangible assets, and other assets; charges, such
    as acquired in-process research and development, patent
    settlements, stock-based compensation, and restructuring; and
    certain indirect costs that are not charged to the other
    operating segments.

During the March 2008 quarter, we modified our segment reporting
    structure in line with business operational changes associated
    with Enrique Salem’s promotion to Chief Operating Officer
    in January 2008. The following changes have been made to our
    segment reporting structure:

•

The Security and Data Management segment was renamed the
    Security and Compliance segment.

•

The Altiris segment, in its entirety, moved into the Security
    and Compliance segment.

•

The Data Center Management segment was renamed the Storage and
    Server Management segment. We also moved the Backup Exec
    products to the Storage and Server Management Group from the
    Security and Data Management segment.

•

There were no changes to net revenues in the Consumer Products,
    Services, or Other segments.

The revised segment structure as noted above has been reflected
    in our financial results for all periods presented in this
    annual report.

Consumer
    Products

Our Consumer Products segment provides suites and services that
    include Internet security, PC tuneup, and backup for individual
    users and home offices. Our

functionality, which automatically updates these products with
    the latest technology, malware protection, antispyware
    definitions, antiphishing and antispam blacklists, parental
    control databases, and many other types of security and
    application data.

During fiscal 2008, the growth in our consumer business was
    driven by the evolving threat landscape, including malicious
    threats and crimeware, and increased demand for products that
    secure sensitive online consumer interactions, such as financial
    transactions, online backup and identity management. Our primary
    consumer products are: Norton

    Services provides a full range of programs, including technical
    training and security awareness training, to help customers
    optimize their Symantec solutions.

Sales and
    Channel Strategy

Consumer
    Products

We sell our consumer products and services to individuals and
    home offices globally through a multi-tiered network of
    distribution partners. Our strategy is to place our products in
    a variety of channels where consumers might consider purchasing
    security, PC tuneup and backup products.

Our products are available to customers through channels that
    include distributors, retailers, direct marketers,
    Internet-based resellers, OEMs, system builders, educational
    institutions, and ISPs. We separately sell annual content update
    subscriptions directly to end-users primarily through the
    Internet. We also sell some of our products and product upgrades
    in conjunction with channel partners through direct mail/email
    and over the Internet.

Sales in the Consumer Products business through our electronic
    distribution channel, which includes sales derived from OEMs,
    subscriptions, upgrades, online sales, and renewals, grew by
    $174 million in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. During fiscal
    2008, approximately 73 percent of revenue in the Consumer
    Products segment came from our electronic channels.

Enterprise
    Solutions

We sell and market our products and related services to
    enterprise customers both directly and through a variety of
    indirect sales channels, which include value-added resellers, or
    VARs, large account resellers, or LARs, distributors, system
    integrators, or SIs, and OEMs. Our enterprise customers include
    many leading global corporations, small and medium-sized
    businesses, and many government agencies around the world. Some
    of our sales efforts are targeted to senior executives and IT
    department personnel who are responsible for managing a
    company’s IT initiatives.

Our primary method of demand generation for enterprise customers
    is through our direct sales force. We ended fiscal 2008 with
    approximately 9,200 individuals in our sales and services team.
    Account managers are responsible for customer relationships and
    opportunity management and are supported by product and services
    specialists.

We complement our direct sales efforts with indirect sales
    channels such as resellers, VARs, LARs, distributors, and SIs,
    primarily to address the small to medium-sized enterprise
    market. We sell our products through authorized distributors in
    more than 40 countries throughout the world. Our top distributor
    during fiscal 2008 was Ingram Micro, Inc.

Another important element of our Enterprise Solutions strategy
    involves our relationships with OEM partners that incorporate
    our products into their products, bundle our products with their
    products, or serve as authorized resellers of our products.

Marketing
    and Advertising

Our marketing expenditure relates primarily to advertising and
    promotion, which includes demand generation and brand
    recognition of our consumer and enterprise products. Our
    advertising and promotion efforts include, but are not limited
    to, electronic and print advertising, trade shows, collateral
    production, and all forms of direct marketing. We also invest in
    cooperative marketing campaigns with distributors, resellers,
    retailers, OEMs, and industry partners.



We invest in various retention marketing and customer loyalty
    programs to help drive renewals and encourage customer advocacy
    and referrals. We also provide focused vertical marketing
    programs in targeted industries and countries.

We typically offer two types of rebate programs within most
    countries: volume incentive rebates to channel partners and
    promotional rebates to distributors and end-users. Distributors
    and resellers earn volume incentive rebates primarily based upon
    product sales to end-users. We also offer rebates to individual
    users who purchase products through various resale channels.

We regularly offer upgrade rebates to consumers purchasing a new
    version of a product. Both volume incentive rebates and end-user
    rebates are accrued as an offset to revenue.

Support

Symantec has centralized support facilities throughout the world
    that provide rapid, around-the-clock responses to a wide range
    of customer inquiries. We have support facilities with experts
    in technical areas associated with the products we produce and
    the operating environments in which these products are deployed
    by many of our customers. Our technical support experts provide
    customers with information on product implementation and usage,
    issue resolution, and countermeasures and identification tools
    for new threats. Support is available in multiple languages
    including Cantonese, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian,
    Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese, and Spanish. We believe
    that enhanced language support is an important element of our
    success and plan to continue our investments in the delivery of
    non-English technical support.

Symantec provides customers various levels of enterprise support
    offerings depending on their needs. Business Critical Services,
    our highest level of protection provides personalized, proactive
    support from technical experts for enterprises that require
    secure, uninterrupted access to their data and applications. Our
    enterprise security support program offers annual maintenance
    support contracts to enterprise customers worldwide, including
    content, upgrades, and technical support. Our standard technical
    support includes the following: unlimited hotline service
    delivered by telephone, fax, email, and over the Internet;
    immediate patches for severe problems; and, periodic software
    updates and access to our technical knowledge base and
    frequently asked questions.

Our consumer product support program provides self-help online
    services, phone, chat, and email support to consumers worldwide.
    A team of product experts, editors, and language translators are
    dedicated to maintaining the robustness of the online knowledge
    base. Generally, we use an outside vendor to provide telephone
    product support for a fee. Customers that subscribe to
    LiveUpdate receive automatic downloads of the latest virus
    definitions, application bug fixes, and patches for most of our
    consumer products.

Customers

Our solutions are used worldwide by individual and enterprise
    customers in a wide variety of industries, small, medium and
    large enterprises, as well as various governmental entities. In
    fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, one distributor, Ingram Micro,
    accounted for 10%, 11% and 13%, respectively, of our total net
    revenues. Our distributor arrangements with Ingram Micro consist
    of several non-exclusive, independently negotiated agreements
    with its subsidiaries, each of which cover different countries
    or regions. Each of these agreements is separately negotiated
    and is independent of any other contract (such as a master
    distribution agreement), and these agreements are not based on
    the same form of contract. None of these contracts was
    individually responsible for over 10 percent of our total
    net revenues in each of the last three fiscal years. In fiscal
    2008, 2007 and 2006, one reseller, Digital River, accounted for
    11%, 12% and 11%, respectively, of our total net revenues.

Research
    and Development

Research and development expenses, exclusive of in-process
    research and development associated with acquisitions, were
    $895 million, $867 million, and $682 million in
    fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. We believe that
    technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect
    to continue to commit substantial resources to research and
    development.



Symantec embraces a global R&D strategy with teams of
    engineers worldwide focused on product development, pure
    research and on tailoring our products to meet regional
    requirements. Conducting R&D close to our customers ensures
    that we have intimate knowledge of the markets we serve and a
    better link between our customers and our labs. Symantec strives
    to maintain long-term technological leadership by nurturing
    innovation, generating new ideas and developing next-generation
    technologies across all of our business.

Symantec Research Labs is a group designed to foster new
    technologies and products to help us maintain leadership in
    existing markets. The team focuses on short, medium, and
    long-term applied research, develops new products in emerging
    areas, participates in government-funded research projects, and
    partners with universities to conduct research to support
    Symantec’s needs.

Our Security Response experts, located at research centers
    throughout the world, are focused on collecting and analyzing
    the latest malware threats, ranging from network security
    threats and vulnerabilities to viruses and worms. All this data
    is collected through our Symantec Global Intelligence Network,
    which provides insight into emerging trends in attacks,
    malicious code activity, phishing, spam, and other threats. The
    Security Response team is also focused on developing new
    technologies and approaches to protecting customers’
    information and systems.

Independent contractors are used for various aspects of the
    product development process. In addition, elements of some of
    our products are licensed from third parties.

Acquisitions

Our strategic technology acquisitions are designed to enhance
    the features and functionality of our existing products, as well
    as extend our product leadership. We use strategic acquisitions
    to provide certain technology, people, and products for our
    overall product and services strategy. We consider both time to
    market and potential market share gains when evaluating
    acquisitions of technologies, product lines, or companies. We
    have completed a number of acquisitions of technologies,
    companies, and products in the past, and we have also disposed
    of technologies and products. We may acquire

and/or

dispose of other technologies, products and companies in the
    future.

During fiscal 2008, we completed the following acquisitions:

For further discussion of our acquisitions, see Notes 4 and
    20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this
    annual report.

Competition

Our markets are consolidating, are highly competitive, and are
    subject to rapid changes in technology. We are focused on
    integrating next generation technology capabilities into our
    solution set in order to differentiate ourselves from the
    competition. We believe that the principal competitive factors
    necessary to be successful in our industry also include, time to
    market, price, reputation, financial stability, breadth of
    product offerings, customer support, brand recognition, and
    effective sales and marketing efforts.



In addition to the competition we face from direct competitors,
    we face indirect or potential competition from retail,
    application providers, operating system providers, network
    equipment manufacturers, and other OEMs, who may provide various
    solutions and functions in their current and future products. We
    also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for
    the attention of customers at the retail level and in corporate
    accounts. In addition, we compete with other software companies,
    operating system providers, network equipment manufacturers and
    other OEMs to acquire technologies, products, or companies and
    to publish software developed by third parties. We also compete
    with other software companies in our effort to place our
    products on the computer equipment sold to consumers by OEMs.

The competitive environments in which each segment operates are
    described below.

Consumer
    Products

Some of the channels in which our consumer products are offered
    are highly competitive. Our competitors are sometimes intensely
    focused on customer acquisition, which has led such competitors
    to offer their technology for free, engage in aggressive
    marketing, or enter into competitive partnerships.

Our primary competitors in the Consumer Products segment are
    McAfee, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, and Trend Micro Inc. There
    are also several smaller regional security companies that we
    compete against primarily in the EMEA and APJ regions.

Security
    and Compliance

In the security and compliance markets, we compete against many
    companies that offer competing products to our technology
    solutions and competing services to our response and support
    services. Our primary competitors in the security market are
    Cisco Systems, Inc., McAfee, Microsoft, and Trend Micro. There
    are also several smaller regional security companies that we
    compete against primarily in the EMEA and APJ regions.

Storage
    and Server Management

The markets for storage and server management are intensely
    competitive. In the areas of data protection and storage and
    server management, our primary competitors are CA Inc.,
    CommVault Systems, Inc., EMC, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM
    Corp., Microsoft, Oracle Corp., and Sun Microsystems, Inc.

Services

We believe that the principal competitive factors for our
    services segment include technical capability, customer
    responsiveness, and our ability to hire and retain talented and
    experienced services personnel. Our primary competitors in the
    services segment are EMC, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and regional
    specialized consulting firms. In the managed security services
    business, our primary competitors are IBM and VeriSign, Inc.

Intellectual
    Property

Protective
    Measures

We regard some of the features of our internal operations,
    software, and documentation as proprietary and rely on
    copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws,
    confidentiality procedures, contractual arrangements, and other
    measures to protect our proprietary information. Our
    intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that
    enables us to gain recognition for our products, services, and
    technology and enhance our competitive position.

As part of our confidentiality procedures, we generally enter
    into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, distributors,
    and corporate partners, and we enter into license agreements
    with respect to our software, documentation, and other
    proprietary information. These license agreements are generally
    non-transferable and have a perpetual term. We also educate our
    employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to
    protect our facilities, equipment, and networks.



Trademarks,
    Patents, Copyrights, and Licenses

Symantec and the Symantec logo are trademarks or registered
    trademarks in the U.S. and other countries. In addition to
    Symantec and the Symantec logo, we have used, registered,

and/or

applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks
    to help distinguish our products, technologies, and services
    from those of our competitors in the U.S. and foreign
    countries and jurisdictions. We enforce our trademark, service
    mark, and trade name rights in the U.S. and abroad. The
    duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to
    country, and in the U.S. we generally are able to maintain
    our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for
    as long as the trademarks are in use.

We have a number of U.S. and foreign issued patents and
    pending patent applications, including patents and rights to
    patent applications acquired through strategic transactions,
    which relate to various aspects of our products and technology.
    The duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the
    country of issuance and for the U.S. is typically
    17 years from the date of issuance of the patent or
    20 years from the date of filing of the patent application
    resulting in the patent, which we believe is adequate relative
    to the expected lives of our products.

Our products are protected under U.S. and international
    copyright laws and laws related to the protection of
    intellectual property and proprietary information. We take
    measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary
    rights notices, and we actively enforce such rights in the
    U.S. and abroad. However, these measures may not provide
    sufficient protection, and our intellectual property rights may
    be challenged. In addition, we license some intellectual
    property from third parties for use in our products, and
    generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed
    intellectual property rights. While we believe that our ability
    to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is
    important to our success, we also believe that our business as a
    whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent,
    trademark, license, or other intellectual property right.

Seasonality

As is typical for many large software companies, our business is
    seasonal. Software license and maintenance orders are generally
    higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our
    first and second fiscal quarters. A significant decline in
    license and maintenance orders is typical in the first quarter
    of our fiscal year as compared to license and maintenance orders
    in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. In addition, we
    generally receive a higher volume of software license and
    maintenance orders in the last month of a quarter, with orders
    concentrated in the later part of that month. We believe that
    this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns
    and budget cycles, as well as the impact of compensation
    incentive plans for our sales personnel. Revenue generally
    reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than
    orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is
    shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition
    criteria are met, and because a significant portion of our
    in-period revenue is provided by the ratable recognition of our
    deferred revenue balance.

Employees

As of March 28, 2008, we employed more than
    17,600 people worldwide, approximately 53 percent of
    whom reside in the U.S. Approximately 6,200 employees
    work in sales and marketing; 5,200 in research and development;
    3,900 in support and services; and 2,300 in management,
    manufacturing, and administration.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

A description of the risk factors associated with our business
    is set forth below. The list is not exhaustive and you should
    carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before
    investing in our common stock.

If we
    are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services
    that achieve widespread market acceptance, or if we are unable
    to continually improve the performance, features, and
    reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our
    business model to keep pace with industry trends, our business
    and operating results could be adversely affected.

Our future success depends on our ability to respond to the
    rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or
    introducing new products, product upgrades, and services on a
    timely basis. We have in the past incurred, and will continue to
    incur, significant research and development expenses as we
    strive to remain competitive. New product development and
    introduction involves a significant commitment of time and
    resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges
    including:

•

Managing the length of the development cycle for new products
    and product enhancements, which has frequently been longer than
    we originally expected

•

Adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to
    technological developments by our competitors and customers

•

Extending the operation of our products and services to new
    platforms and operating systems

•

Entering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited
    experience

•

Managing new product and service strategies, including
    integrating our various security and storage technologies,
    management solutions, customer service, and support into unified
    enterprise security and storage solutions

•

Incorporating acquired products and technologies

•

Trade compliance issues affecting our ability to ship new
    products

•

Developing or expanding efficient sales channels

•

Obtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access
    from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to
    enable the development and deployment of interoperable products,
    including source code licenses for certain products with deep
    technical integration into operating systems

In addition, if we cannot adapt our business models to keep pace
    with industry trends, our revenue could be negatively impacted.
    In connection with our enterprise software offerings, we license
    our applications on a variety of bases, such as per server, per
    processor, or based on performance criteria such as per amount
    of data processed or stored. If enterprises continue to migrate
    towards solutions, such as virtualization, which allow
    enterprises to run multiple applications and operating systems
    on a single server and thereby reduce the number of servers they
    are required to own and operate, we may experience lower license
    revenues unless we are able to successfully change our
    enterprise licensing model or sell additional software to take
    into account the impact of these new solutions.

If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges,
    or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not
    technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance,
    our business and operating results could be adversely affected.

Fluctuations
    in demand for our products and services are driven by many
    factors, and a decrease in demand for our products could
    adversely affect our financial results.

We are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and
    services due to a variety of factors, including general economic
    conditions, competition, product obsolescence, technological
    change, shifts in buying patterns



and budget constraints of our actual and potential customers,
    levels of broadband usage, awareness of security threats to IT
    systems, and other factors. While such factors may, in some
    periods, increase product sales, fluctuations in demand can also
    negatively impact our product sales. If demand for our products
    declines, our revenues and gross margin could be adversely
    affected. For example, if the challenging economic conditions in
    the United States or other key markets continue or deteriorate
    further, we may experience slower or negative revenue growth and
    our business and operating results might suffer.

We
    operate in a highly competitive environment, and our competitors
    may gain market share in the markets for our products that could
    adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to
    decline.

We operate in intensely competitive markets that experience
    rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards,
    changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product
    introductions and improvements. If we are unable to anticipate
    or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new
    competitors gain market share in any of our markets, our
    competitive position could weaken and we could experience a drop
    in revenue that could adversely affect our business and
    operating results. To compete successfully, we must maintain a
    successful research and development effort to develop new
    products and services and enhance existing products and
    services, effectively adapt to changes in the technology or
    product rights held by our competitors, appropriately respond to
    competitive strategies, and effectively adapt to technological
    changes and changes in the ways that our information is
    accessed, used, and stored within our enterprise and consumer
    markets. If we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors
    or to changing technological and customer demands, we could
    experience a negative effect on our competitive position and our
    financial results.

Our traditional competitors include independent software vendors
    that offer software products that directly compete with our
    product offerings. In addition to competing with these vendors
    directly for sales to end-users of our products, we compete with
    them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the
    product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer
    hardware OEMs and ISPs. Our competitors could gain market share
    from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products
    with the products of our competitors or if they more actively
    promote our competitors’ products than our products. In
    addition, software vendors who have bundled our products with
    theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or
    other vendors’ software or may limit our access to standard
    product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products
    for their platform.

We face growing competition from network equipment and computer
    hardware manufacturers and large operating system providers.
    These firms are increasingly developing and incorporating into
    their products data protection and storage and server management
    software that competes at some levels with our product
    offerings. Our competitive position could be adversely affected
    to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality
    incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our
    products.

Another growing industry trend is the software-as-a-service
    (“SaaS”) business model, whereby software vendors
    develop and host their applications for use by customers over
    the Internet. This allows enterprises to obtain the benefits of
    commercially licensed, internally operated software without the
    associated complexity or high initial

set-up

and
    operational costs. Advances in the SaaS business model could
    enable the growth of our competitors and could affect the
    success of our traditional software licensing models. We have
    recently released our own SaaS offerings. However, it is
    uncertain whether our SaaS strategy will prove successful or
    whether we will be able to successfully incorporate our SaaS
    offering into our current licensing models. Our inability to
    successfully develop and market SaaS product offerings could
    cause us to lose business to competitors.

Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical,
    sales, marketing, or other resources than we do and consequently
    may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their
    products instead of ours. We also face competition from many
    smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the
    markets in which we compete.



If we
    fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively
    or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to
    their customers, our operating results could be adversely
    affected.

We sell our products to customers around the world through
    multi-tiered sales and distribution networks. Sales through
    these different channels involve distinct risks, including the
    following:

Direct Sales.

A significant portion of our
    revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our
    direct sales force to end-users. Special risks associated with
    this sales channel include:

•

Longer sales cycles associated with direct sales efforts

•

Difficulty in hiring, retaining, and motivating our direct sales
    force

•

Substantial amounts of training for sales representatives to
    become productive, including regular updates to cover new and
    revised products

Indirect Sales Channels.

A significant portion
    of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels,
    including distributors that sell our products to end-users and
    other resellers. This channel involves a number of risks,
    including:

•

Our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products
    to end-users

•

Our resellers and distributors are not subject to minimum sales
    requirements or any obligation to market our products to their
    customers

•

Our reseller and distributor agreements are generally
    nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause

•

Our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute
    competing products and may, from time to time, place greater
    emphasis on the sale of these products due to pricing,
    promotions, and other terms offered by our competitors

OEM Sales Channels.

A significant portion of
    our revenues is derived from sales through our OEM partners that
    incorporate our products into, or bundle our products with,
    their products. Our reliance on this sales channel involves many
    risks, including:

•

Our lack of control over the shipping dates or volume of systems
    shipped

•

Our OEM partners are generally not subject to minimum sales
    requirements or any obligation to market our products to their
    customers

•

Our OEM partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements
    with us and new terms may be less favorable due, among other
    things, to an increasingly competitive relationship with certain
    partners

•

Sales through our OEM partners are subject to changes in
    strategic direction, competitive risks, and other issues that
    could result in reduction of OEM sales

•

The development work that we must generally undertake under our
    agreements with our OEM partners may require us to invest
    significant resources and incur significant costs with little or
    no associated revenues

•

The time and expense required for the sales and marketing
    organizations of our OEM partners to become familiar with our
    products may make it more difficult to introduce those products
    to the market

•

Our OEM partners may develop, market, and distribute their own
    products and market and distribute products of our competitors,
    which could reduce our sales

If we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels
    successfully, these channels may conflict with one another or
    otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate, which could reduce
    our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our
    competitive position. Some of our distribution partners have
    experienced financial difficulties in the past, and if our
    partners suffer financial difficulties in the future, we may
    have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could
    adversely affect our operating results. In addition, reliance on
    multiple channels subjects us to



events that could cause unpredictability in demand, which could
    increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for
    the future, and could result in adverse operating results in
    future periods.

We
    have grown, and may continue to grow, through acquisitions that
    give rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect
    our future financial results.

We have in the past acquired, and we expect to acquire in the
    future, other businesses, business units, and technologies.
    Acquisitions can involve a number of special risks and
    challenges, including:

•

Complexity, time, and costs associated with the integration of
    acquired business operations, workforce, products, and
    technologies into our existing business, sales force, employee
    base, product lines, and technology

•

Diversion of management time and attention from our existing
    business and other business opportunities

•

Loss or termination of employees, including costs associated
    with the termination or replacement of those employees

•

Assumption of debt or other liabilities of the acquired
    business, including litigation related to the acquired business

•

The addition of acquisition-related debt as well as increased
    expenses and working capital requirements

•

Dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders

•

Increased costs and efforts in connection with compliance with
    Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

•

Substantial accounting charges for restructuring and related
    expenses, write-off of in-process research and development,
    impairment of goodwill, amortization of intangible assets, and
    stock-based compensation expense

Integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be
    a complex, time consuming, and expensive process, and can impact
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting.

If integration of our acquired businesses is not successful, we
    may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or
    undergo other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee.
    To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our
    technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and
    manage the personnel of the acquired operations. We also must
    effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired
    business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various
    interests, and may need to enter new markets in which we have no
    or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have
    stronger market positions.

Any of the foregoing, and other factors, could harm our ability
    to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired
    businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of
    acquisitions. In addition, because acquisitions of high
    technology companies are inherently risky, no assurance can be
    given that our previous or future acquisitions will be
    successful and will not adversely affect our business, operating
    results, or financial condition.

We
    have not historically maintained substantial levels of
    indebtedness, and our financial condition and results of
    operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively
    manage our liabilities.

In June 2006, we sold $2.1 billion in aggregate principal
    amount of convertible senior notes. As a result of the sale of
    the notes, we have a substantially greater amount of long term
    debt than we have maintained in the past. In addition, we have
    entered into a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of
    $1 billion and we borrowed $200 million under the
    facility in November 2007 to fund a portion of the purchase
    price of our acquisition of Vontu, Inc. Our credit facility
    allows us immediate access to an additional $800 million of
    domestic funds if we identify opportunities for its use. From
    time to time in the future, we may also incur indebtedness in
    addition to the amount available under our credit facility. Our
    maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect
    our flexibility to take advantage of certain corporate
    opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition
    and results of operations.



Our
    international operations involve risks that could increase our
    expenses, adversely affect our operating results, and require
    increased time and attention of our management.

We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers
    located outside of the U.S. and we have significant
    operations outside of the U.S., including engineering, sales,
    customer support, and production. We plan to expand our
    international operations, but such expansion is contingent upon
    the financial performance of our existing international
    operations as well as our identification of growth
    opportunities. Our international operations are subject to risks
    in addition to those faced by our domestic operations, including:

•

Potential loss of proprietary information due to
    misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our
    intellectual property rights than U.S. laws

•

Requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls,
    including trade and labor restrictions and related laws that
    reduce the flexibility of our business operations

•

Regulations or restrictions on the use, import, or export of
    encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the
    acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks
    for secure communications

•

Central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate
    cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in
    international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the
    U.S.

•

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability
    such as higher interest rates in the U.S. and inflation
    that could reduce our customers’ ability to obtain
    financing for software products or that could make our products
    more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in
    certain countries

•

Limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current
    levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest
    sufficiently in our international operations

•

Longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and
    difficulties in collecting accounts receivable

•

Difficulties in staffing, managing, and operating our
    international operations, including difficulties related to
    administering our stock plans in some foreign countries

•

Difficulties in coordinating the activities of our
    geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations

•

Seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in
    Europe and in other periods in other countries

•

Reduced sales due to the failure to obtain any required export
    approval of our technologies, particularly our encryption
    technologies

•

Costs and delays associated with developing software in multiple
    languages

•

Political unrest, war, or terrorism, particularly in areas in
    which we have facilities

A significant portion of our transactions outside of the
    U.S. are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly,
    our future operating results will continue to be subject to
    fluctuations in foreign currency rates. We may be negatively
    affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the
    future, especially if international sales continue to grow as a
    percentage of our total sales.

The level of corporate tax from sales to our

non-U.S. customers

is less than the level of tax from sales to our
    U.S. customers. This benefit is contingent upon existing
    tax regulations in the U.S. and in the countries in which
    our international operations are located. Future changes in
    domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect
    our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits.

Our
    products are complex and operate in a wide variety of computer
    configurations, which could result in errors or product
    failures.

Because we offer very complex products, undetected errors,
    failures, or bugs may occur, especially when products are first
    introduced or when new versions are released. Our products are
    often installed and used in large-scale computing environments
    with different operating systems, system management software,
    and equipment and



networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures in
    our products or may expose undetected errors, failures, or bugs
    in our products. Our customers’ computing environments are
    often characterized by a wide variety of standard and
    non-standard configurations that make pre-release testing for
    programming or compatibility errors very difficult and
    time-consuming. In addition, despite testing by us and others,
    errors, failures, or bugs may not be found in new products or
    releases until after commencement of commercial shipments. In
    the past, we have discovered software errors, failures, and bugs
    in certain of our product offerings after their introduction
    and, in some cases, may have experienced delayed or lost
    revenues as a result of these errors.

Errors, failures, or bugs in products released by us could
    result in negative publicity, product returns, loss of or delay
    in market acceptance of our products, loss of competitive
    position, or claims by customers or others. Many of our end-user
    customers use our products in applications that are critical to
    their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects
    in our products than to defects in other, less critical,
    software products. In addition, if an actual or perceived breach
    of information integrity or availability occurs in one of our
    end-user customer’s systems, regardless of whether the
    breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of
    the effectiveness of our products could be harmed. Alleviating
    any of these problems could require significant expenditures of
    our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions,
    delays, or cessation of our product licensing, which could cause
    us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely
    affect our operating results.

If we
    are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, lose key
    personnel, fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully,
    or fail to manage our employee base effectively, we may be
    unable to develop new and enhanced products and services,
    effectively manage or expand our business, or increase our
    revenues.

Our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and
    retain our key management, technical, sales, marketing, finance,
    and other critical personnel. Our officers and other key
    personnel are

employees-at-will,

and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them.
    Competition for people with the specific skills that we require
    is significant. In order to attract and retain personnel in a
    competitive marketplace, we believe that we must provide a
    competitive compensation package, including cash and
    equity-based compensation. The volatility in our stock price may
    from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or
    retain employees. In addition, we may be unable to obtain
    required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number
    of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation
    plans, and recent changes in accounting rules require us to
    treat the issuance of employee stock options and other forms of
    equity-based compensation as compensation expense. As a result,
    we may decide to issue fewer equity-based incentives and may be
    impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary
    personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified
    employees, or conversely, if we fail to manage employee
    performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market
    conditions, our business and operating results could be
    adversely affected.

Key personnel have left our company in the past and there likely
    will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time
    in the future. The loss of any key employee could result in
    significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely
    affecting the timeliness of product releases, the successful
    implementation and completion of company initiatives, the
    effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our
    internal control over financial reporting, and the results of
    our operations. In addition, hiring, training, and successfully
    integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time
    consuming, may cause additional disruptions to our operations,
    and may be unsuccessful, which could negatively impact future
    revenues.

We are
    a party to several class action lawsuits, which could require
    significant management time and attention and result in
    significant legal expenses, and which could, if not determined
    favorably, negatively impact our business, financial condition,
    results of operations, and cash flows.

We have been named as a party to class action lawsuits, and we
    may be named in additional litigation. The expense of defending
    such litigation may be costly and divert management’s
    attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which
    could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and
    cash flows. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in such
    litigation could negatively impact our business, results of
    operations, and cash flows.



Third
    parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could
    cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from
    selling our products.

From time to time, we receive claims that we have infringed the
    intellectual property rights of others, including claims
    regarding patents, copyrights, and trademarks. In addition,
    former employers of our former, current, or future employees may
    assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to
    us the confidential or proprietary information of these former
    employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result
    in costly litigation and distract management from day-to-day
    operations. If we are not successful in defending such claims,
    we could be required to stop selling, delay shipments of, or
    redesign our products, pay monetary amounts as damages, enter
    into royalty or licensing arrangements, or satisfy
    indemnification obligations that we have with some of our
    customers. We cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing
    arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be
    available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

In addition, we license and use software from third parties in
    our business. These third party software licenses may not
    continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all,
    and may expose us to additional liability. This liability, or
    our inability to use any of this third party software, could
    result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business
    that could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

If we
    do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third
    parties from making unauthorized use of our products and
    technology, our financial results could be harmed.

Most of our software and underlying technology is proprietary.
    We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination
    of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through
    copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws. However,
    all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be
    challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. Third
    parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise
    obtain, use, distribute, and sell our proprietary information
    without authorization. Third parties may also develop similar or
    superior technology independently by designing around our
    patents. Our shrink-wrap license agreements are not signed by
    licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of
    some jurisdictions. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign
    countries do not offer the same level of protection of our
    proprietary rights as the laws of the U.S., and we may be
    subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries.
    The unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary
    information could result in reduced sales of our products. Any
    legal action to protect proprietary information that we may
    bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could
    adversely affect our ability to access software, operating
    system, and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor, or
    cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products
    to their customers. In addition, any legal action to protect
    proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in,
    alone or through our alliances with the Business Software
    Alliance (“BSA”), or the Software &
    Information Industry Association (SIIA), could be costly, may
    distract management from day-to-day operations, and may lead to
    additional claims against us, which could adversely affect our
    operating results.

Some
    of our products contain “open source” software, and
    any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these
    open source licenses could negatively affect our
    business.

Certain of our products are distributed with software licensed
    by its authors or other third parties under so-called “open
    source” licenses, which may include, by way of example, the
    GNU General Public License (GPL), GNU Lesser General Public
    License (LGPL), the Mozilla Public License, the BSD License, and
    the Apache License. Some of these licenses contain requirements
    that we make available source code for modifications or
    derivative works we create based upon the open source software,
    and that we license such modifications or derivative works under
    the terms of a particular open source license or other license
    granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we
    combine our proprietary software with open source software in a
    certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source
    licenses, be required to release the source code of our
    proprietary software. In addition to risks related to license
    requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater
    risks than use of third party commercial software, as open
    source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls
    on origin of the software. We have established processes to help
    alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening
    requests from our development organizations for the use of open
    source, but we cannot be sure that all



open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our
    products. In addition, many of the risks associated with usage
    of open source cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly
    addressed, negatively affect our business.

Our
    software products and website may be subject to intentional
    disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future
    sales.

Although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to
    prevent intentional disruptions, we expect to be an ongoing
    target of attacks specifically designed to impede the
    performance of our products. Similarly, experienced computer
    programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the
    security of our website and misappropriate proprietary
    information or cause interruptions of our services. Because the
    techniques used by such computer programmers to access or
    sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized
    until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate
    these techniques. Our activities could be adversely affected and
    our reputation and future sales harmed if these intentionally
    disruptive efforts are successful.

Increased
    customer demands on our technical support services may adversely
    affect our relationships with our customers and our financial
    results.

We offer technical support services with many of our products.
    We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate
    short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We
    also may be unable to modify the format of our support services
    to compete with changes in support services provided by
    competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers.
    Further customer demand for these services, without
    corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely
    affect our operating results.

We have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide
    consumer support functions to third party service providers. If
    these companies experience financial difficulties, do not
    maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy
    our contracts, or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient
    level under these contracts, the level of support services to
    our customers may be significantly disrupted, which could
    materially harm our relationships with these customers.

Accounting
    charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial
    results.

Our financial results have been in the past, and may continue to
    be in the future, materially affected by non-cash and other
    accounting charges, including:

•

Amortization of intangible assets, including acquired product
    rights

•

Impairment of goodwill

•

Stock-based compensation expense

•

Restructuring charges

•

Impairment of long-lived assets

•

Loss on sale of a business and similar write-downs of assets
    held for sale

For example, in connection with our acquisition of Veritas, we
    have recorded approximately $2.8 billion of acquired
    product rights and other intangible assets and $8.6 billion
    of goodwill. We have recorded and will continue to record future
    amortization charges with respect to a portion of these
    intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense related
    to the stock options to purchase Veritas common stock assumed by
    us. In addition, we will evaluate our long-lived assets,
    including property and equipment, goodwill, acquired product
    rights, and other intangible assets, whenever events or
    circumstances occur which indicate that these assets might be
    impaired. Goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment in the
    fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events
    and circumstances warrant, and our evaluation depends to a large
    degree on estimates and assumptions made by our management. Our
    assessment of any impairment of goodwill is based on a
    comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units to
    the carrying value of that reporting unit. Our determination of
    fair value relies on management’s assumptions of our future
    revenues, operating costs, and other relevant factors. If
    management’s estimates of future operating results change,
    or if there are changes to other assumptions such as the
    discount rate



applied to future operating results, the estimate of the fair
    value of our reporting units could change significantly, which
    could result in a goodwill impairment charge.

The foregoing types of accounting charges may also be incurred
    in connection with or as a result of other business
    acquisitions. The price of our common stock could decline to the
    extent that our financial results are materially affected by the
    foregoing accounting charges.

Our
    effective tax rate may increase, which could increase our income
    tax expense and reduce our net income.

Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several
    factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:

•

Changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income
    before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate
    that have differing statutory tax rates

•

Changing tax laws, regulations, and interpretations in multiple
    jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the requirements of
    certain tax rulings

•

The tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and
    restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between
    reporting periods

•

Tax assessments, or any related tax interest or penalties, could
    significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in
    which the settlements take place.

The price of our common stock could decline if our financial
    results are materially affected by an adverse change in our
    effective tax rate.

We report our results of operations based on our determinations
    of the amount of taxes owed in the various tax jurisdictions in
    which we operate. From time to time, we receive notices that a
    tax authority to which we are subject has determined that we owe
    a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority,
    and we are regularly engaged in discussions, and sometimes
    disputes, with these tax authorities. We are engaged in disputes
    of this nature at this time. If the ultimate determination of
    our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in
    excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for,
    our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could
    be adversely affected.

Fluctuations
    in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of
    our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in
    the future.

Our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and
    are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number
    of factors, many of which are outside of our control and which
    could adversely affect our operations and operating results. If
    our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future
    financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities
    analysts and investors, our stock price could be negatively
    affected. Any volatility in our quarterly financial results may
    make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or
    pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock. Our
    operating results for prior periods may not be effective
    predictors of our future performance.

Factors associated with our industry, the operation of our
    business, and the markets for our products may cause our
    quarterly financial results to fluctuate, including:

•

Reduced demand for any of our products

•

Entry of new competition into our markets

•

Competitive pricing pressure for one or more of our classes of
    products

•

Our ability to timely complete the release of new or enhanced
    versions of our products

•

The number, severity, and timing of threat outbreaks (e.g. worms
    and viruses)

•

Our resellers making a substantial portion of their purchases
    near the end of each quarter



•

Enterprise customers’ tendency to negotiate site licenses
    near the end of each quarter

•

Cancellation, deferral, or limitation of orders by customers

•

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

•

Movement in interest rates

•

The rate of adoption of new product technologies and new
    releases of operating systems

•

Weakness or uncertainty in general economic or industry
    conditions in any of the multiple markets in which we operate
    that could reduce customer demand and ability to pay for our
    products and services

•

Political and military instability, which could slow spending
    within our target markets, delay sales cycles, and otherwise
    adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and operate
    effectively

•

Budgetary constraints of customers, which are influenced by
    corporate earnings and government budget cycles and spending
    objectives

•

Disruptions in our business operations or target markets caused
    by, among other things,

•

Earthquakes, floods, or other natural disasters affecting our
    headquarters located in Silicon Valley, California, an area
    known for seismic activity, or our other locations worldwide

•

Acts of war or terrorism

•

Intentional disruptions by third parties

•

Health or similar issues, such as a pandemic

Any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of
    our common stock to fluctuate significantly.

Our
    stock price may be volatile in the future, and you could lose
    the value of your investment.

The market price of our common stock has experienced significant
    fluctuations in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the
    future, and as a result you could lose the value of your
    investment. The market price of our common stock may be affected
    by a number of factors, including:

•

Announcements of quarterly operating results and revenue and
    earnings forecasts by us that fail to meet or be consistent with
    our earlier projections or the expectations of our investors or
    securities analysts

•

Announcements by either our competitors or customers that fail
    to meet or be consistent with their earlier projections or the
    expectations of our investors or securities analysts

•

Rumors, announcements, or press articles regarding our or our
    competitors’ operations, management, organization,
    financial condition, or financial statements

•

Changes in revenue and earnings estimates by us, our investors,
    or securities analysts

•

Accounting charges, including charges relating to the impairment
    of goodwill

•

Announcements of planned acquisitions or dispositions by us or
    by our competitors

•

Announcements of new or planned products by us, our competitors,
    or our customers

•

Gain or loss of a significant customer

•

Inquiries by the SEC, NASDAQ, law enforcement, or other
    regulatory bodies

•

Acts of terrorism, the threat of war, and other crises or
    emergency situations

•

Economic slowdowns or the perception of an oncoming economic
    slowdown in any of the major markets in which we operate



The stock market in general, and the market prices of stocks of
    technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme
    price volatility that has adversely affected, and may continue
    to adversely affect, the market price of our common stock for
    reasons unrelated to our business or operating results.

Comparison
    of cumulative total return — June 23, 1989(1) to
    March 31, 2008

The graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return
    on Symantec common stock from June 23, 1989 (the date of
    Symantec’s initial public offering) to March 31, 2008
    with the cumulative total return on the S&P 500 Composite
    Index and the S&P Information Technology Index over the
    same period (assuming the investment of $100 in Symantec common
    stock and in each of the other indices on June 30, 1989,
    and reinvestment of all dividends, although no dividends other
    than stock dividends have been declared on Symantec common
    stock). Symantec has provided this additional data to provide
    the perspective of a longer time period which is consistent with
    Symantec’s history as a public company. The comparisons in
    the graph below are based on historical data and are not
    intended to forecast the possible future performance of Symantec
    common stock.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

OVERVIEW

Our
    Business

Symantec is a global leader in providing security, storage and
    systems management solutions to help businesses and consumers
    secure and manage their information. We provide customers
    worldwide with software and services that protect, manage and
    control information risks related to security, data protection,
    storage, compliance, and systems management. We help our
    customers manage cost, complexity and compliance by protecting
    their IT infrastructure as they seek to maximize value from
    their IT investments.

We have a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to
    March 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to fiscal
    years in this report relate to fiscal year and periods ended
    March 28, 2008, March 30, 2007 and March 31,
    2006. Our 2009 fiscal year will consist of 53 weeks and
    will end on April 3, 2009.



On April 6, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Altiris
    Inc., a leading provider of IT management software that enables
    businesses to easily manage and service network-based endpoints.
    We used approximately $841 million of our cash and cash
    equivalents to fund the acquisition, which amount was net of
    Altiris’ cash and cash equivalents balance. We believe this
    acquisition enables us to help customers better manage and
    enforce security policies at the endpoint, identify and protect
    against threats, and repair and service assets.

On November 30, 2007, we completed our acquisition of
    Vontu, Inc. (“Vontu”), a provider of Data Loss
    Prevention (DLP) solutions that assists organizations in
    preventing the loss of confidential or proprietary information,
    for approximately $298 million in cash, which amount was
    net of Vontu’s cash and cash equivalents balance. On
    November 29, 2007, we borrowed $200 million under our
    five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit
    facility to partially finance this acquisition.

In February 2008, we contributed $150 million in cash to
    our joint venture with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. in exchange
    for a 49% interest in the joint venture. The joint venture will
    develop, manufacture, market and support security and storage
    appliances to global telecommunications carriers and enterprise
    customers.

Our
    Operating Segments

Our operating segments are significant strategic business units
    that offer different products and services, distinguished by
    customer needs. During the March 2008 quarter, we modified the
    segment reporting structure in line with business operational
    changes associated with Enrique Salem’s promotion to Chief
    Operating Officer in January 2008. The following changes have
    been made to our segment reporting structure: (1) the
    Security and Data Management segment was renamed the Security
    and Compliance segment; (2) the Altiris segment, in its
    entirety, has been moved into the Security and Compliance
    segment; (3) the Data Center Management segment was renamed
    the Storage and Server Management segment; and (4) the
    Backup Exec products were moved from the Security and Data
    Management segment to the Storage and Server Management segment.
    As a result of these changes, we now operate in five operating
    segments: Security and Compliance, Storage and Server
    Management, Consumer Products, Services, and Other. The new
    business structure more directly aligns the operating segments
    with markets and customers, and we believe will establish more
    direct lines of reporting responsibilities, speed decision
    making, and enhance the ability to pursue strategic growth
    opportunities. All financial information from periods prior to
    these changes in reportable segments contained in this annual
    report has been recast, where appropriate, in this annual report
    to reflect the revised segment reporting structure noted above.

For further descriptions of our operating segments, see
    Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    in this annual report. Our reportable segments are the same as
    our operating segments.

Financial
    Results and Trends

Our net income was $464 million for fiscal 2008 as compared
    to $404 million and $157 million for fiscal 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The higher net income for fiscal 2008 as
    compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to higher revenue in
    fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 as well as a net gain from
    settlements of litigation of $59 million in fiscal 2008 for
    which there was no corresponding gain in fiscal 2007. Our net
    income for fiscal 2008 was partially offset by higher operating
    expenses, including a loss on sale of a business of
    $95 million related to the disposition of our APM business,
    for which there is no corresponding charge in fiscal 2007.

The higher net income for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006
    was primarily due to the write-off in fiscal 2006 of
    $285 million of acquired in-process research and
    development, or IPR&D, as a result of the Veritas
    acquisition for which there is no comparable charge in fiscal
    2007. This increase was partially offset by $154 million of
    stock-based compensation expense related to our adoption of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS,
    No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, effective April 1,
    2006, higher employee compensation costs resulting from
    increased employee headcount, and $70 million of
    restructuring charges compared to $25 million in fiscal
    2006.

Revenue for fiscal 2008 was $5.9 billion, or 13%, higher
    than revenue for fiscal 2007. For fiscal 2008 we realized
    revenue growth across all of our geographic regions as compared
    to fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 and experienced revenue growth in
    all of our segments. Foreign currency fluctuations positively
    impacted our



international revenue growth in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal
    2007. In fiscal 2007, foreign currency fluctuations also
    positively impacted our revenue growth internationally compared
    to fiscal 2006. We are unable to predict the extent to which
    revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates. If international sales become a
    greater portion of our total sales in the future, changes in
    foreign exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on
    our revenues and operating results. In addition, our April 2007
    acquisition of Altiris contributed $194 million to our
    revenue increase from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008.

Our deferred revenue at March 28, 2008 was 12% higher than
    at the corresponding amount as of March 30, 2007. Increased
    sales related to some of our enterprise products and the
    depreciation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies
    drove the increase in deferred revenue realized for the year
    ended March 28, 2008. In recent periods, the percentage of
    our in-period revenue that has resulted from the amortization of
    our deferred revenue balance has been increasing, and we believe
    this trend has normalized as we are over twelve months into the
    transition of combining our buying programs for all of our
    enterprise offerings. The factors contributing to the growth in
    revenue and deferred revenue are discussed more fully in
    “Results of Operations” below.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we implemented a cost
    savings initiative, which included a workforce reduction of
    approximately 6% worldwide. We have fully implemented this cost
    savings initiative in fiscal 2008. In the December 2007 quarter,
    we implemented another restructuring plan to continue our focus
    on controlling costs. These cost savings initiatives resulted in
    restructuring charges totaling $74 million for the year
    ended March 28, 2008 and we expect to incur additional
    charges during fiscal year 2009 as a result of this plan.

Our gross margins and operating expenses were affected during
    fiscal 2008 as a result of recent changes in the terms of some
    of our relationships with key Original Equipment Manufacturers
    (“OEMs”). We have negotiated new contract terms with
    some of our OEM partners, which have resulted in some payments
    to OEM partners being included in our Consolidated Statements of
    Income as Operating expenses rather than Cost of revenues. In
    general, payments to OEMs made on a placement fee per unit basis
    will be treated as Operating expenses, while payments based on a
    revenue-sharing model will be amortized as Cost of revenues. The
    increase in Operating expenses will more than offset the
    decrease in Cost of revenues because placement fee arrangements
    are expensed on an estimated average cost basis, while
    revenue-sharing arrangements are generally amortized ratably
    over a one-year period, and because payments to OEMs increased.
    These recent changes have largely been in effect for fiscal 2008
    and we do not expect the trend relating to placement fees
    increasing Operating expense and decreasing Cost of revenues to
    continue.

Cash flows were strong in fiscal 2008 as we achieved
    $1.8 billion in operating cash flow. We ended fiscal 2008
    with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
    investments. In addition, during fiscal 2008 we repurchased
    81 million shares of our common stock at an average price
    of $18.53, for total consideration of $1.5 billion.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and
    related notes included in this annual report in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States,
    requires us to make estimates, which include judgments and
    assumptions, that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and related disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates
    on historical experience and on various assumptions that we
    believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate
    our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly.
    Historically, our critical accounting estimates have not
    differed materially from actual results; however, actual results
    may differ from these estimates under different conditions. If
    actual results differ from these estimates and other
    considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual
    report, the resulting changes could have a material adverse
    effect on our Consolidated Statements of Income, and in certain
    situations, could have a material adverse effect on liquidity
    and our financial condition.

A critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and
    assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the
    estimate is made. Different estimates that reasonably could have
    been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially
    impact the operating results or financial condition. We believe
    that the estimates



described below represent our critical accounting estimates, as
    they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated
    financial statements. See also Note 1 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.

Revenue
    Recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software
    industry. We recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the
    requirements of Statement of Position

97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

, and any applicable
    amendments or modifications. Revenue recognition requirements in
    the software industry are very complex and require us to make
    many estimates.

In arrangements that include multiple elements, including
    perpetual software licenses and maintenance

and/or

services, and packaged products with content updates, we
    allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on
    vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of the fair value
    of the undelivered elements, and recognize the difference
    between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for
    the undelivered items as revenue. Our deferred revenue consists
    primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product
    maintenance, consumer product content updates, and arrangements
    where VSOE does not exist. Deferred revenue totaled
    approximately $3.1 billion as of March 28, 2008, of
    which $415 million was classified as “Long-term
    deferred revenue” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. VSOE
    of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered
    element is sold separately. We determine fair value of the
    undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our
    stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the
    stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements. When VSOE does
    not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance, then the
    entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the
    performance period. Changes to the elements in a software
    arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements,
    the fair value of the respective elements, and increasing
    flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact
    the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over
    time.

For our consumer products that include content updates, we
    recognize revenue and the associated cost of revenue ratably
    over the term of the subscription upon sell-through to
    end-users. We recognize deferred revenue and inventory for the
    respective revenue and cost of revenue amounts of unsold product
    held by our distributors and resellers.

We expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate
    inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer
    demand, which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand
    based on recent buying trends. We ship product to our
    distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid
    purchase orders. Our distributors and resellers base the
    quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer
    demand, which may exceed the expected level of a four or six
    week supply. We offer limited rights of return if the inventory
    held by our distributors and resellers is above the expected
    level of a four or six week supply. We estimate future returns
    under these limited rights of return in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Standard (“SFAS”) No. 48,

Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists.

We
    typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by
    our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level.
    Because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess
    inventory that will be returned, we primarily offset deferred
    revenue against trade accounts receivable for the amount of
    revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels.

Reserves for product returns.

We reserve for
    estimated product returns as an offset to revenue based
    primarily on historical trends. We fully reserve for obsolete
    products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred
    revenue. If we made different estimates, material differences
    could result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for
    any period presented. More or less product may be returned than
    what was estimated

and/or

the
    amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what
    was estimated. These factors and unanticipated changes in the
    economic and industry environment could make actual results
    differ from our return estimates.

Reserves for rebates.

We estimate and record
    reserves for channel and end-user rebates as an offset to
    revenue. For consumer products that include content updates,
    rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the
    term of the subscription. Our estimated reserves for channel
    volume incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and
    resellers’ actual performance against the terms and
    conditions of volume incentive rebate programs, which are
    typically entered into quarterly. Our reserves for end-user
    rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the
    promotional programs, actual sales during the promotion, amount
    of actual redemptions received, historical redemption trends by
    product and by type of promotional program, and the value of the
    rebate. We also consider



current market conditions and economic trends when estimating
    our reserves for rebates. If we made different estimates,
    material differences may result in the amount and timing of our
    net revenues for any period presented.

Valuation
    of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived
    assets

When we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to
    tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible
    assets acquired. Any residual purchase price is recorded as
    goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires
    management to make significant estimates in determining the fair
    values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially
    with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based on
    historical experience and information obtained from the
    management of the acquired companies. These estimates can
    include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is
    expected to generate in the future, the appropriate
    weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected
    to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are
    inherently uncertain and unpredictable. In addition,
    unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may
    affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates.

Goodwill.

At March 28, 2008, goodwill was
    $11.2 billion, other intangible assets, net were
    $1.2 billion, and acquired product rights, net were
    $649 million. We assess goodwill and intangible assets with
    indefinite life for impairment within our reporting units
    annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in
    accordance with SFAS No. 142

“Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets”

(“SFAS 142”).
    The provisions of SFAS 142 require that a two-step
    impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, we
    compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying
    value. Our reporting units are consistent with our reportable
    segments. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the
    carrying value of the equity assigned to that unit, goodwill is
    not considered to be impaired and we are not required to perform
    further testing. If the carrying value of the equity assigned to
    the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit,
    then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in
    order to determine the implied fair value of that reporting
    unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we
    would record an impairment loss equal to the excess.

To determine the reporting units’ fair value in the current
    year evaluation, we use the income approach under which we
    calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the
    estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit. Our cash
    flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue,
    operating costs, growth rates and other relevant factors. If
    management’s estimates of future operating results change,
    or if there are changes to other assumptions, the estimate of
    the fair value of our goodwill could change significantly. Such
    change could result in goodwill impairment charges in future
    periods, which could have a significant impact on our operating
    results and financial condition.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we performed our annual
    impairment analysis of goodwill. If management’s estimates
    of future operating results change, or if there are changes to
    other assumptions, the estimate of the fair value of our
    goodwill could change significantly. Such change could result in
    goodwill impairment charges in future periods, which could have
    a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Intangible Assets.

We assess the impairment of
    other identifiable intangible assets according to SFAS 142
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an
    asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. An
    impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the
    estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of
    the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying
    amount. Such impairment loss would be measured as the difference
    between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. Our
    cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted
    revenue, operating costs, and other relevant factors. If
    management’s estimates of future operating results change,
    or if there are changes to other assumptions, the estimate of
    the fair value of our acquired product rights and other
    identifiable intangible assets could change significantly. Such
    change could result in impairment charges in future periods,
    which could have a significant impact on our operating results
    and financial condition. During fiscal 2008 we recorded an
    impairment charge of $95 million primarily for the write
    down of intangible assets related to the sale of our Application
    Performance Management business.

Long-Lived Assets.

We account for long-lived
    assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets.”

We record impairment charges on long-lived
    assets to be held and



used when we determine that the carrying value of the long-lived
    assets may not be recoverable. Based upon the existence of one
    or more indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment of
    long-lived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow
    method using assumptions determined by our management to be
    commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business
    model. Our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment
    based on our historical results and anticipated results and are
    subject to many triggering factors which could change and cause
    a material impact to our operating results or financial
    condition. During fiscal 2008, we recorded an impairment charge
    of $1 million for our Newport News, VA building held for
    sale.

Acquired Product Rights.

We account for
    acquired product rights in accordance with
    SFAS No. 86, “

Accounting for Costs of Computer
    Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed”

. We
    record impairment charges on acquired product rights when we
    determine that the net realizable value of the assets may not be
    recoverable. To determine the net realizable value of the
    assets, we use the estimated future gross revenues from each
    product. Our estimated future gross revenues of each product are
    based on company forecasts and are subject to change. During
    fiscal 2008, we did not have any indications of impairment.

Restructuring

We have estimated expenses for excess facilities related to
    consolidating, moving, and relocating personnel or sites as a
    result of restructuring activities and business acquisitions. In
    determining our estimates, we obtain information from
    third-party leasing agents to calculate anticipated third-party
    sublease income and the vacancy period prior to finding a
    sublessee. Market conditions may affect our ability to sublease
    facilities on terms consistent with our estimates. Our ability
    to sublease facilities on schedule or to negotiate lease terms
    resulting in higher or lower sublease income than estimated may
    affect our accrual for site closures. In addition, differences
    between estimated and actual related broker commissions, tenant
    improvements, and other exit costs may increase or decrease our
    accrual upon final negotiation. If we made different estimates
    regarding these various components of our excess facilities
    costs, the amount recorded for any new period presented could
    vary materially from those actually recorded.

Stock-based
    Compensation

Effective April 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of, and
    accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with,
    SFAS No. 123R. Under SFAS No. 123R, we must
    measure the fair value of all stock-based awards, including
    stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and purchase
    rights under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, on the
    date of grant and amortize the fair value of the award over the
    requisite service period. We elected the modified prospective
    application method, under which prior periods are not revised
    for comparative purposes. The valuation provisions of
    SFAS No. 123R apply to new awards and to awards that
    were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently
    modified. For stock-based awards granted on or after
    April 1, 2006, we recognize stock-based compensation
    expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
    period, which is generally the vesting period. We also recognize
    estimated compensation expense for the unvested portion of
    awards that were outstanding as of the effective date on a
    straight-line basis over the remaining service period using the
    compensation costs estimated for the SFAS No. 123 pro
    forma disclosures.

We currently use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to
    determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of
    the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using
    an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well
    as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective
    variables. These variables include our expected stock price
    volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected
    employee stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors,
    risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends.

We estimate the expected life of options granted based on an
    analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and
    post-vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the
    contractual life of the option. Expected volatility is based on
    the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate
    with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility
    of traded options. The risk free interest rate is equal to the
    U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal
    to the expected life. We do not currently pay cash dividends on
    our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the
    foreseeable future. Accordingly, our expected dividend yield is
    zero. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of
    grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual



forfeitures differ from those estimates. We estimate forfeitures
    of stock options, RSUs, and ESPP purchase rights at the time of
    grant based on historical experience and record compensation
    expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. All
    stock-based awards are amortized on a straight-line basis over
    the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally
    the vesting periods.

If factors change and we employ different assumptions for
    estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods or
    if we decide to use a different valuation model, the amount of
    such expense recorded in future periods may differ significantly
    from what we have recorded in the current period.

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in
    estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
    restrictions and are fully transferable, characteristics not
    present in our option grants. Existing valuation models,
    including the Black-Scholes and lattice binomial models, may not
    provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock-based
    compensation. Consequently, there is a risk that our estimates
    of the fair values of our stock-based compensation awards on the
    grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values
    realized upon the exercise, expiration, early termination, or
    forfeiture of those stock-based payments in the future. Certain
    stock-based payments, such as employee stock options, may expire
    worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as
    compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant
    date and reported in our financial statements. Alternatively,
    value may be realized from these instruments that is
    significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated
    on the grant date and reported in our financial statements.

The application of these principles may be subject to further
    interpretation and refinement over time. There are significant
    differences among valuation models, and there is a possibility
    that we will adopt different valuation models in the future.
    This may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and
    materially affect the fair value estimate of stock-based
    payments. It may also result in a lack of comparability with
    other companies that use different models, methods, and
    assumptions.

Stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock
    options, RSUs, and employee stock purchases recognized under
    SFAS No. 123R for the year ended March 28, 2008
    was $164 million.

Contingencies
    and Litigation

We evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or
    pending litigation in accordance with SFAS No. 5,

“Accounting for Contingencies”

. We assess the
    likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from a potential
    claim or legal proceeding, as well as potential ranges of
    probable losses, when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings
    are probable and reasonably estimable. A determination of the
    amount of accrued liabilities required, if any, for these
    contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate
    matter. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, we
    base our estimates on the information available at the time of
    our assessment. As additional information becomes available, we
    reassess the potential liability related to its pending claims
    and litigation and may revise our estimates. Any revisions in
    the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material
    impact on our operating results and financial position. As of
    March 28, 2008, we recognized a loss for the pending
    settlement of a class action lawsuit related to a
    pre-acquisition contingency of Veritas for $21.5 million.
    The amount was determined based upon existing facts and
    circumstances of the outcome and estimates that we could
    reasonably and likely pay.

Income
    Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. The
    provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and
    liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for
    operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in each jurisdiction
    in which we operate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to
    taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets
    are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation
    allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is
    believed more likely than not to be realized.

We are required to compute our income taxes in each federal,
    state, and international jurisdiction in which we operate. This
    process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as
    well as assess temporary differences



between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and
    liabilities, including items such as accruals and allowances not
    currently deductible for tax purposes. The income tax effects of
    the differences we identify are classified as current or
    long-term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our judgments, assumptions, and
    estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take
    into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax
    laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits
    conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in
    tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of
    current and future tax audits could significantly impact the
    amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Income. We must also
    assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized
    from future taxable income and, based on this assessment,
    establish a valuation allowance, if required. Our determination
    of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of
    assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including forecasted
    earnings, future taxable income, and the relative proportions of
    revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and
    international jurisdictions in which we operate. To the extent
    we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation
    allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a
    corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our
    Consolidated Statements of Income, or to goodwill to the extent
    that the valuation allowance related to tax attributes of the
    acquired entities.

We failed to file in a timely fashion the final pre-acquisition
    tax return for Veritas, and as a result, it is uncertain whether
    we can claim a lower tax rate on a dividend made from a Veritas
    foreign subsidiary under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
    We are currently petitioning the IRS for relief to allow us to
    claim the lower rate of tax. Because we were unable to obtain
    this relief prior to filing the Veritas tax return in May 2006,
    we have paid $130 million of additional U.S. taxes.
    The potential outcomes with respect to our payment of this
    amount include:

•

If we ultimately obtain relief from the IRS on this matter, the
    $130 million that we paid in May 2006 may be refunded
    to us and we will use that amount to increase our income tax
    accrual for the Veritas transfer pricing disputes. For more
    information see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in this annual report.

•

If we ultimately do not receive relief from the IRS on this
    matter, and we otherwise have an adjustment arising from the
    Veritas transfer pricing disputes, then we would only owe
    additional tax with regard to such disputes to the extent that
    such adjustment is in excess of $130 million.

•

If we ultimately do not receive relief from the IRS on this
    matter, and we otherwise do not have an adjustment arising from
    the Veritas transfer pricing disputes, then (1) we would be
    required to adjust the purchase price of Veritas to reflect a
    reduction in the amount of pre-acquisition tax liabilities
    assumed; and (2) we would be required to recognize an equal
    amount of income tax expense, up to $130 million.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB,
    issued Interpretation No., or FIN, 48, Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    SFAS No. 109. The provisions of FIN 48 became
    effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. See
    “Newly Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting
    Pronouncements” under Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    this annual report for further discussion.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised),

Business Combinations

. The accounting
    treatment related to pre-acquisition uncertain tax positions
    will change when SFAS No. 141(R) becomes effective,
    which will be in first quarter of our fiscal year 2010. See
    “Newly Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting
    Pronouncements” under Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    this annual report for further discussion.

Net revenues increased in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007
    primarily due to higher amortization of deferred revenue as a
    result of the higher amount of deferred revenue at the beginning
    of the fiscal 2008 period than at the beginning of the fiscal
    2007 period and increased sales related to our Backup Exec,
    Storage Foundation, and Net Backup products. Our total deferred
    revenue grew from $2.754 billion to $3.077 billion in
    fiscal 2008 and grew from $2.163 billion to
    $2.754 billion in fiscal 2007. The higher deferred revenue
    balance at the beginning of fiscal 2008 is due to a greater
    portion of the revenue from transactions being subject to
    deferral since the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2007
    than was the case in prior periods as discussed below. In
    addition, we realized $194 million due to the new sales of
    products from our April 6, 2007 acquisition of Altiris for
    which there is no comparable revenue in the same prior year
    period and a favorable foreign currency impact in fiscal 2008 as
    compared to fiscal 2007.

As noted above, we realized an increase in recognized revenue
    from deferred revenue in fiscal 2008. This increase in deferred
    revenue resulted from combining our buying programs for all of
    our enterprise offerings, negotiating more transactions that
    commit customers to multi-year periods, offering more
    flexibility in contractual terms and in product deployments, and
    providing more services in combination with license and
    maintenance sales. In the December 2006 quarter, we combined our
    buying programs for all of our enterprise offerings to provide
    our customers and partners a single vendor relationship and
    simplify the way we do business. Previously, our storage and
    availability products and services were sold under Veritas’
    pre-merger buying programs, while our security products and
    services were sold under our historical buying programs. The
    combination of buying programs resulted in a change in the VSOE
    for some of our storage and availability products and services.
    This change, coupled with an increased number of maintenance
    renewals sold with a license component, resulted in a larger
    portion of revenues associated with contracts being classified
    as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue, which is
    subject to deferral, instead of Licenses revenue, which is
    generally recognized immediately. These factors resulted in
    lower recognized revenue growth rates in the first six months of
    fiscal 2008 and in fiscal 2007.

Some of our customers have also requested increased flexibility
    in product deployments in site license arrangements. This may
    result in an increase in deferred revenue and classification of
    all revenues associated with the specific contract as Content,
    subscriptions, and maintenance revenue, which is recognized over
    time, as VSOE may not exist in certain types of flexible
    deployment contracts. As a result of our initiative to offer
    customers a more comprehensive solution to protect and manage a
    global IT infrastructure, we have seen an increasing amount of
    services sold in conjunction with license and maintenance
    contracts. Inclusion of such services often results in increased
    deferred revenue and increased classification of revenues as
    Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue, as VSOE may not
    exist for some of the services provided.

Net revenues increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006
    primarily due to the new sales of the storage and availability
    products and services from our July 2005 acquisition of Veritas
    for the full twelve months in the 2007 period compared to nine
    months in the 2006 period. We were required under purchase
    accounting rules to reduce the amount of Veritas’ deferred
    revenue that we recorded in connection with the acquisition of
    Veritas to an amount equal to the fair value of our contractual
    obligation related to that deferred revenue. Unless otherwise
    specified, “storage and availability products and
    services” include products and services obtained through
    our acquisition of Veritas, and complementary products and
    services obtained or developed subsequent to such acquisition.
    These products and services contributed $518 million of net
    revenues in the June 2006 quarter for which there was no
    comparable revenue in the June 2005 quarter. The remainder of
    the revenue increase is due to



increases in our consumer products revenue and services
    offerings of $181 million and $92 million,
    respectively, due to continued growth in demand. The segment
    discussions that follow further describe the revenue increases.
    These increases are partially offset by the effects of the
    increased flexibility in contract terms and the combination of
    our buying programs discussed above.

Beginning with the release of our 2006 consumer products that
    include content updates in the December 2005 quarter, we
    recognize revenue related to these products ratably. As a
    result, this revenue has been classified as Content,
    subscriptions, and maintenance beginning in the December 2005
    quarter. In addition, as noted above, increased flexibility in
    contract terms and the combination of our buying programs in the
    December 2006 quarter have impacted revenue recognition. These
    changes caused a larger portion of revenue associated with
    contracts to be classified as Content, subscriptions, and
    maintenance revenue, which is subject to deferral, instead of
    Licenses revenue, which is generally recognized immediately, as
    discussed above in “Total Net Revenues.”

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues increased in
    fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an
    increase of $394 million in revenue related to enterprise
    products and services, excluding acquired Altiris products. This
    increase in enterprise product and services revenue was largely
    attributable to higher amortization of deferred revenue, for the
    reasons discussed above in “Total Net Revenues.” In
    addition, Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues
    increased $82 million from new sales of products from our
    acquisition of Altiris for which there is no comparable revenue
    in the prior period. The increase is also due to a favorable
    foreign currency impact.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues increased in
    fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the new
    sales of the storage and availability products and services from
    our acquisition of Veritas for the full twelve months in the
    2007 period compared to nine months in the 2006 period. These
    products and services contributed $250 million of Content,
    subscriptions, and maintenance revenues in the June 2006 quarter
    for which there was no comparable revenue in the June 2005
    quarter. In addition, in fiscal 2007, Content, subscriptions,
    and maintenance revenue related to our enterprise products
    increased $271 million due to the fact that the amount of
    revenue recognized in the comparable 2006 period was lower as a
    result of the purchase accounting adjustment discussed under
    “Total Net Revenues” above. Revenue related to our
    consumer products increased $179 million as compared to the
    2006 period due primarily to growth in Norton Internet Security
    products and online revenues due to growth in the use of the
    Internet, and increased awareness and sophistication of security
    threats. Enterprise products and services, excluding
    Veritas-related products and services, increased
    $309 million as a result of growth in our maintenance
    renewals due to an increasing installed base, increased demand
    for our service offerings, other acquisitions, and the
    combination of our buying programs implemented in the December
    2006 quarter, which impacted our VSOE methodology and
    classification of Licenses revenue and Content, subscriptions,
    and maintenance revenue, as discussed above under “Total
    Net Revenues.”

Licenses revenue increased in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal
    2007 primarily due to an increase of $112 million from new
    sales of products from our acquisition of Altiris for which
    there is no comparable revenue in the prior period and a
    favorable foreign currency impact. This increase is offset by a
    decrease in license revenues from the Security and Compliance
    and Storage and Server Management segments of $68 million
    (excluding acquired Altiris products, which mitigated the
    decline in license revenues from those products), as a result of
    increased flexibility in contract terms and the combination of
    our buying programs in the December 2006 quarter, causing a
    larger portion of revenue associated with contracts to be
    classified as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue
    instead of Licenses revenue during the first half of fiscal 2008.

Licenses revenue increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal
    2006 primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and
    availability products obtained through our acquisition of
    Veritas for the full twelve months in the 2007 period compared
    to nine months in the 2006 period. These products contributed
    $268 million of Licenses revenues in the June 2006 quarter
    for which there was no comparable revenue in the June 2006
    quarter. Excluding this June 2006 contribution, License revenues
    were down in both Security and Data Management and Data Center
    Management segments as a result of the increased flexibility in
    contract terms and the combination of our buying programs
    implemented in the December 2006 quarter, both of which caused a
    larger portion of contracts to be classified as Content,
    subscriptions, and maintenance, which is subject to deferral,
    instead of Licenses revenue, which is generally recognized
    immediately, as discussed above in “Total Net
    Revenues.”

Consumer Products revenues increased in fiscal 2008 compared to
    fiscal 2007 due to an aggregate increase of $286 million in
    revenue from our Norton Internet Security and Norton 360
    products. These increases are due to the increase in demand for
    these products during both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008, as the
    revenue from our consumer products is generally recognized
    ratably over the 12 months after the product is sold. These
    increases are partially offset by aggregate decreases of
    $129 million in revenue from our Norton AntiVirus and
    Norton System Works products. This decrease results from our
    customers’ continued migration to our Norton Internet
    Security product and our new Norton 360 product, which offer
    broader protection and backup features to address the rapidly
    changing threat environment. Our electronic orders include sales
    derived from OEMs, subscriptions, upgrades, online sales, and
    renewals. Revenue from electronic orders (which includes sales
    of the aforementioned products)



grew by $174 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal
    2007. Included in the total Consumer Products segment revenue
    increase is a favorable foreign currencies impact.

Consumer Products revenues increased in fiscal 2007 as compared
    to fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase of $293 million
    in revenue from our Norton Internet Security products. This
    increase was partially offset by aggregate decreases in revenue
    from our Norton AntiVirus and Norton System
    Works

tm

products of $100 million. These decreases resulted from our
    customers’ migration to the Norton Internet Security
    products, which offer broader protection to address the rapidly
    changing threat environment. Our electronic orders include OEM
    subscriptions, upgrades, online sales, and renewals. Revenue
    from electronic orders (which includes sales of our Norton
    Internet Security products and our Norton AntiVirus products)
    grew by $221 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal
    2006.

Total expenses from our Consumer segment increased
    $183 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The
    increase is primarily a result of higher OEM placement fees,
    which is primarily a result of placement fees being recognized
    as operating expense as discussed in “Cost of
    Revenues” below.

Total expenses increased $160 million in fiscal 2007 as
    compared to fiscal 2006. The increase is driven by higher OEM
    placement fees. The balance of the increase is primarily a
    result of higher salary and related expenses.

Security and Compliance revenues increased in fiscal 2008
    compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to $194 million of
    new sales of products from our acquisition of Altiris for which
    there is no comparable revenue in the same prior year period.
    Included in the total Security and Compliance segment revenue
    increase is a favorable foreign currencies impact.

Security and Compliance revenues increased in fiscal 2007 as
    compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to new sales of our
    Enterprise Vault product, which was acquired with Veritas, for
    the full twelve months in the 2007 period compared to nine
    months in the 2006 period. This product contributed
    $38 million of revenue in the June 2006 quarter for which
    there was no comparable revenue in the June 2005 quarter. In
    addition the purchase accounting adjustment, discussed under
    “Total Net Revenues” above, contributed
    $20 million (cumulatively) in the September 2006, December
    2006, and March 2007 quarters as compared to the comparable
    quarters of the prior year. In addition, revenues increased
    $34 million in fiscal 2007 as a result of acquisitions,
    excluding Veritas, for which there was not a full twelve months
    of revenue or no comparable revenue in fiscal 2006.

Total expenses from our Security and Compliance segment
    increased $169 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal
    2007. The increase is primarily a result of higher salary and
    commissions which includes the impact of the fiscal 2008 Altiris
    and Vontu acquisitions.

Storage and Server Management revenues increased in fiscal 2008
    compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an aggregate increase
    in revenue from our Backup Exec, Storage Foundation, and Net
    Backup products of $203 million, driven by increased demand
    for products related to the standardization and simplification
    of data center infrastructure and higher amortization of
    deferred revenue, as a result of the higher amount of deferred
    revenue at the beginning of fiscal 2008 than at the beginning of
    fiscal 2007, for the reasons discussed above in “Total Net
    Revenues.” Included in the total Storage and Server
    Management segment revenue increase is a favorable foreign
    currencies impact.

Storage and Server Management revenues increased in fiscal 2007
    compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to new sales of storage
    and availability products from our acquisition of Veritas for
    the full twelve month period compared to nine months in the
    fiscal 2006 period. These products contributed $452 million
    of revenue in the June 2006 quarter for which there was no
    comparable revenue in the June 2005 quarter. The effect of the
    purchase accounting adjustment discussed under “Total Net
    Revenues” above also contributed $220 million to the
    increase in revenue in fiscal 2007. Excluding the effects of the
    aforementioned items, revenue in fiscal 2007 as compared to
    fiscal 2006 was relatively flat due to the combination of the
    buying programs for all of our enterprise offerings in the
    December 2006 quarter. This combination resulted in lower
    recognized revenue and increased deferred revenue as discussed
    under “Total Net Revenues” above.

Total expenses from our Storage and Server Management segment
    increased $130 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal
    2007. The increase is primarily a result of the impairment of
    intangible assets related to the APM business of
    $95 million. Additionally, increases in Sales expenses
    drove costs higher for the Storage and Server Management group.

Services revenues increased in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal
    2007 primarily due to an increase in consulting services of
    $48 million as a result of increased demand for a more
    comprehensive solution by purchasing our service offerings in
    conjunction with the purchase of our products and the increased
    desire for customers to augment the



capabilities of their own IT staff with our onsite consultants.
    In addition, Services revenue increased $11 million due to
    increased demand for our Business Critical Services in fiscal
    2008 as compared to fiscal 2007.

Services revenue increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal
    2006 primarily due to a $57 million increase in security
    consulting services and the inclusion of the storage and
    availability services obtained through our acquisition of
    Veritas for the full twelve months in the 2007 period compared
    to nine months in the 2006 period. Included in the above
    increase is $28 million of Services revenues from these
    acquired services offerings in the June 2006 quarter for which
    there was no comparable revenue in the June 2005 quarter. In
    addition, Services revenue increased $15 million due to
    increased demand for our Business Critical Services in fiscal
    2007 as compared to fiscal 2006.

Total expenses from our Services segment increased
    $32 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The
    increase is primarily a result of higher salary and wages to
    support the increase in revenue.

International revenues increased in fiscal 2008 as compared to
    fiscal 2007 primarily due to increased revenues related to our
    Storage and Server Management and Security and Compliance
    products of $272 million, as a result of increased demand
    for products related to the standardization and simplification
    of data center infrastructure and higher amortization of
    deferred revenue for the reasons described above. These products
    contributed $179 million in increased revenues in the
    Americas in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. Sales of new
    products from our acquisition of Altiris increased revenues in
    the international regions and the Americas by $72 million
    and $122 million, respectively, for which there is no
    comparable revenue in the prior period. Growth in revenues in
    international regions and the Americas from sales of products of
    our Consumer Products of $96 million and $60 million,
    respectively, was driven by prior period demand for Norton
    Internet Security products. Foreign currencies had a favorable
    impact on net revenues in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007.

International revenues increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to
    fiscal 2006 primarily due to new sales of storage and
    availability products and services from our acquisition of
    Veritas for the full twelve months in the 2007 period compared
    to nine months in the 2006 period. These products and services
    contributed $232 million of international revenues in the
    June 2006 quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in
    the June 2005 quarter. In the Americas, these products
    contributed $286 million in the June 2006 quarter for which
    there was no comparable revenue in the June 2005 quarter. In
    addition, a portion of the revenue increase in fiscal 2007 is
    due to the fact that the amount of revenue recognized in the
    comparable 2006 period was lower as a result of the purchase
    accounting adjustment discussed under “Total Net
    Revenues” above. The purchase accounting adjustment
    increased fiscal 2007 revenues by $188 million in the
    Americas and $83 million in the international regions
    compared to fiscal 2006. Growth in our Consumer Products
    segment, driven by Norton Internet Security, resulted in a
    $129 million increase in the international regions and a
    $52 million increase in the Americas in fiscal 2007
    revenues versus fiscal 2006. Both domestic and international
    revenue from enterprise offerings were negatively impacted
    primarily due to the increased flexibility in our contract terms
    and the combination of our buying programs. These changes
    resulted in a larger portion of contracts being subject to
    deferral and a correspondingly lower amount of revenue
    recognized in the current period, as discussed in “Total
    Net Revenues” above. Foreign currencies had a favorable
    impact on net revenues in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006.

We are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future
    periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates. If international sales become a greater portion of our
    total sales in the future, changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenues and
    operating results.

    arrangements, manufacturing and direct material costs, and
    royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing
    agreements.



Gross margin increased in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007
    due primarily to an increase in revenue and the fact that the
    terms of several of our OEM arrangements changed from
    revenue-sharing arrangements to placement fee arrangements in
    late fiscal 2007. Placement fee arrangements are expensed on an
    estimated average cost basis, while revenue-sharing arrangements
    are generally amortized ratably over a one-year period. In
    addition, we realized year over year increases in services and
    technical support costs.

Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance consists

    billable services, and payments to OEMs under revenue-sharing
    agreements.

Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance decreased as a
    percentage of the related revenue in fiscal 2008 as compared to
    fiscal 2007. The year over year decrease in cost of content,
    subscriptions, and maintenance as a percentage of the related
    revenue is primarily driven by higher revenues and lower OEM
    royalties as a percentage of revenue more than offsetting
    increases in Services expenses.

We expect the impact of moving many of our OEM payments from
    Cost of revenues to Operating expenses to be reduced in future
    periods as the change had been in effect for most of fiscal
    2008. Our past OEM payments were primarily revenue-sharing
    arrangements, which were generally amortized to Cost of revenues
    over a one-year period. Several of the arrangements negotiated
    in late fiscal 2007 are placement fee arrangements, for which
    the costs are expensed on an estimated average cost basis and
    classified as operating expenses.

Cost of licenses decreased as a percentage of the related

    year decrease in Cost of licenses as a percentage of the related
    revenue is primarily attributable to higher revenues and to a
    lesser extent due to lower obsolescence reserves. Fiscal 2007
    had relatively high obsolescence reserves due to the
    Company’s decision to exit certain aspects of the appliance
    business.

    associated with the Altiris acquisition, offset in part by
    certain acquired product rights becoming fully amortized. For

Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues

    2007. The percentage increase and increase in absolute dollars
    in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2008 as compared to
    fiscal 2007 is primarily due to higher employee compensation
    expense as a result of the Altiris and Vontu acquisitions and
    the OEM placement fees as discussed above under “Financial
    Results and Trends.” We negotiated new contract terms with
    some of our OEM partners in fiscal 2007, for which the expense
    commenced being recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
    In addition, these new contract terms had the effect of moving
    our OEM payments from Cost of revenues to Operating expenses.

Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues
    increased to 39% in fiscal 2007 as compared to 36% in fiscal
    2006. The percentage increase and increase in absolute dollars
    in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2007 as compared to
    fiscal 2006 is primarily due to higher employee compensation
    expense of approximately $335 million resulting from an
    increase in employee headcount. Higher employee compensation
    expense includes the effect of adopting of
    SFAS No. 123R, which added $56 million of
    stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2007 for which there
    is no comparable expense in fiscal 2006. In addition,
    approximately $171 million of the increase is due to an
    additional three months of sales and marketing expenses related
    to the Veritas acquisition, which is included for the full year
    of fiscal 2007 as compared to nine months in fiscal 2006.
    Advertising expense increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to

Research and development expense as a percentage of total

    2007 and fiscal 2006. The increase in absolute dollars in fiscal
    2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 is attributable to a higher
    employee compensation expense primarily related to the Altiris
    and Vontu acquisitions. The increase in fiscal 2007 as compared
    to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to higher employee compensation
    expense of approximately $108 million resulting from an
    increase in employee headcount. Higher employee compensation
    expense includes the effect of adopting of
    SFAS No. 123R, which added $57 million of
    stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2007 for which there
    is no comparable expense in fiscal 2006. In addition,
    approximately $96 million of the increase is due to an
    additional three months of research and development expenses
    related to the Veritas acquisition, which is included for the
    full year of fiscal 2007 as compared to nine months in fiscal
    2006.

General and administrative expense as a percentage of total

    2007, and fiscal 2006. The increase in general and
    administrative expenses in fiscal 2008 as compared with fiscal
    2007 is primarily due to higher salaries and wages resulting
    from the Altiris and Vontu acquisitions offset by a gradual
    reduction in headcount during fiscal 2008. The increase in
    absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses in
    fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to
    higher employee compensation expense of approximately
    $73 million resulting from an increase in employee
    headcount. Higher employee compensation includes the effect of
    adopting SFAS No. 123R, which added $24 million
    of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2007 for which
    there is no comparable expense in fiscal 2006. In addition,
    approximately $20 million of the increase is due to an
    additional three months of general and administrative expenses
    related to the Veritas acquisition, which are included for the
    full year in fiscal 2007 as compared to nine months in fiscal
    2006.

Other purchased intangible assets are comprised of customer
    base, tradenames, partnership agreements, and marketing-related
    assets. The increased amortization in fiscal 2008 is primarily
    associated with a full year of amortization of intangible assets
    associated with the Altiris purchase which occurred in April
    2007. The increased amortization in fiscal 2007 is primarily
    associated with a full year of amortization associated with the
    Veritas acquisition which occurred in July 2005 and the
    acquisitions of Company-i Limited and 4FrontSecurity, Inc. that
    occurred during fiscal 2007. For further discussion of other
    intangible assets from acquisitions and related amortization,
    see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in this annual report.

Acquired
    in-process research and development (IPR&D)

During fiscal 2006, we wrote off IPR&D totaling
    $285 million, of which $284 million was in connection
    with our acquisition of Veritas. The IPR&D was written off
    because the acquired technologies had not reached technological
    feasibility and had no alternative uses. Technological
    feasibility is defined as being equivalent to



completion of a beta-phase working prototype in which there is
    no remaining risk relating to the development. At the time of
    the acquisition in July 2005, Veritas was developing new
    products in multiple product areas that qualify as IPR&D.
    These efforts included NetBackup 6.1, Backup Exec 11.0, Server
    Management 5.0, and various other projects. At the time of the
    acquisition, it was estimated that these IPR&D development
    efforts would be completed over the following 12 to
    18 months at an estimated total cost of $120 million.
    As of March 28, 2008, all IPR&D projects had been
    completed on schedule and within expected costs.

In fiscal 2008, we approved and initiated a restructuring plan
    (“2008 Plan”) to reduce costs, implement management
    structure changes and optimize the business structure and
    discontinue certain products. Projects within the plan began in
    the third quarter of 2008 and are expected to be completed by
    the fourth quarter of 2009. Total remaining costs of the
    restructuring plan, consisting of severance and benefits and
    excess facilities costs, are estimated to range between
    approximately $80 million and $110 million. In fiscal
    2007, we entered into restructuring plans (“2007
    Plans”) to consolidate facilities and reduce operating
    costs through headcount reductions. We also consolidated certain
    facilities and exited facilities as a result of earlier
    acquisitions. In fiscal 2006, we entered into restructuring
    plans (“2006 Plans”) to reduce job redundancy in the
    Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific Japan and to consolidate certain
    facilities in Europe and Asia. Future severance and benefit
    costs and facilities charges for both the 2007 Plans and 2006
    Plans are not expected to be significant.

We recognized $74 million in restructuring charges in
    fiscal 2008 compared to $70 million in fiscal 2007. Charges
    in fiscal 2008 were $59 million of severance and benefit
    costs and $15 million for contract termination costs for
    exited facilities. In fiscal 2008, severance and benefit costs
    of $42 million related to the 2008 Plan and
    $16 million related to the 2007 Plans. In addition,
    facilities contract termination costs of $9 million related
    to the 2007 Plans and $5 million were acquisition-related
    charges for Altiris and Vontu that occurred in fiscal 2008. In
    fiscal 2007, severance and benefit costs of $69 million and
    an insignificant amount for facilities termination costs for the
    2007 Plans. Included in the $69 million for severance and
    benefit costs were $13 million which were
    acquisition-related charges for Veritas and others that occurred
    in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2006, we recognized $18 million
    of severance and benefit costs and $7 million for contract
    termination costs for exited facilities were recognized.

Integration

In fiscal 2007, we recorded $1 million of integration
    charges in connection with our April 2007 acquisition of
    Altiris. These integration charges consisted of costs incurred
    for consulting services and other professional fees. In
    connection with our acquisition of Veritas, we recorded
    integration costs of $16 million in fiscal 2006, which
    consisted primarily of costs incurred for consulting services
    and other professional fees.

The decrease in Interest income in fiscal 2008 as compared to
    fiscal 2007 was due to lower average interest rates and a lower
    average Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investment
    balances. The increase in Interest income in fiscal 2007 as
    compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to a higher average
    cash and cash equivalents and investment balances and higher
    average interest rates realized on those balances.

Interest expense in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 was due
    primarily to the interest and amortization of issuance costs
    related to our 0.75% and 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes
    issued in June 2006. Fiscal 2007 also includes interest and
    accretion related to the 0.25% Convertible Subordinated
    Notes that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of
    Veritas. The 0.25% Veritas Convertible Subordinated Notes were
    paid in full during August 2006. Interest expense in fiscal 2006
    was due primarily to the Veritas 0.25% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes.

In fiscal 2008 we recorded a net gain from Settlements of
    litigation.

In fiscal 2007, Other income (expense), net includes a gain of
    $20 million on the sale of our buildings in Milpitas,
    California, and Maidenhead, United Kingdom.

Our effective tax rate on Income before income taxes was
    approximately 35%, 36%, and 57% in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006,
    respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 reflects
    the impact of non-deductible stock-based compensation offset by
    U.S. tax benefits from domestic manufacturing deductions.
    The effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 reflects the impact of
    non-deductible stock-based compensation offset by foreign
    earnings taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. tax rate. The
    effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 reflects the impact of the
    IPR&D charges and other acquisition-related charges that
    are nondeductible for tax reporting purposes, partially offset
    by foreign earnings taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. tax
    rate, and the effect of the

true-up

of
    taxes on repatriated earnings.

We believe realization of substantially all of our deferred tax
    assets as of March 28, 2008 of $694 million, after
    application of the valuation allowance, is more likely than not
    based on the future reversal of temporary tax differences.
    Realization of approximately $55 million of our deferred
    tax assets as of March 28, 2008 is dependent upon future
    taxable earnings exclusive of reversing temporary differences in
    certain foreign jurisdictions. Levels of future taxable income
    are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in
    Item 1A,

Risk Factors,

set forth



in this annual report. An additional valuation allowance against
    net deferred tax assets may be necessary if it is more likely
    than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets
    will not be realized. We will assess the need for an additional
    valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. Of the
    $38 million total valuation allowance provided against our
    deferred tax assets, approximately $30 million is
    attributable to acquisition-related assets, the benefit of which
    will reduce goodwill when and if realized. The valuation
    allowance decreased by $22 million in fiscal 2008;
    $19 million was reclassified as FIN 48 reserves,
    $3 million was attributable to acquisition-related assets.

American
    Jobs Creation Act of 2004 — Repatriation of foreign
    earnings

In the March 2005 quarter, we repatriated $500 million from
    certain of our foreign subsidiaries that qualified for the 85%
    dividends received deduction under the provisions of the
    American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the Jobs Act, enacted in
    October 2004. In May 2005, clarifying language was issued by the
    U.S. Department of Treasury and the IRS with respect to the
    treatment of foreign taxes paid on the earnings repatriated
    under the Jobs Act and in September 2005, additional clarifying
    language was issued regarding the treatment of certain
    deductions attributable to the earnings repatriation. As a
    result of this clarifying language, we reduced the tax expense
    attributable to the repatriation by approximately
    $21 million in fiscal 2006.

Other
    tax matters

On March 29, 2006, we received a Notice of Deficiency from
    the IRS claiming that we owe additional taxes, plus interest and
    penalties, for the 2000 and 2001 tax years based on an audit of
    Veritas. The incremental tax liability asserted by the IRS was
    $867 million, excluding penalties and interest. On
    June 26, 2006, we filed a petition with the U.S. Tax
    Court protesting the IRS claim for such additional taxes. On
    August 30, 2006, the IRS answered our petition and this
    issue has been docketed for trial in U.S. Tax Court and is
    scheduled to begin on June 30, 2008. In the March 2007
    quarter, we agreed to pay $7 million out of
    $35 million originally assessed by the IRS in connection
    with several of the lesser issues covered in the assessment. The
    IRS has also agreed to waive the assessment of penalties. In a
    Motion to Amend filed March 20, 2008, the IRS moved to
    change its position on the remaining issue in the case. If
    allowed, the IRS’ new position would decrease the
    incremental tax liability for the remaining issue to
    approximately $545 million, excluding interest.

We strongly believe the IRS’ position with regard to this
    matter is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and existing
    Treasury regulations, and that our previously reported income
    tax provision for the years in question is appropriate. No
    payments will be made on the assessment until the issue is
    definitively resolved. If, upon resolution, we are required to
    pay an amount in excess of our provision for this matter, the
    incremental amounts due would be accounted for principally as
    additions to the cost of the Veritas purchase price. Any
    incremental interest accrued subsequent to the date of the
    Veritas acquisition would be recorded as an expense in the
    period the matter is resolved.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we made $90 million
    of tax-related adjustments to the purchase accounting for
    Veritas, consisting of $120 million of additional
    pre-acquisition tax reserve-related adjustments, partially
    offset by a $30 million reduction in other pre-acquisition
    taxes payable. While we strongly disagree with the IRS over both
    its transfer pricing methodologies and the amount of the
    assessment, we have established additional tax reserves for all
    Veritas pre-acquisition years to account for both contingent tax
    and interest risk.

On March 30, 2006, we received notices of proposed
    adjustment from the IRS with regard to an unrelated audit of
    Symantec for fiscal 2003 and 2004. The IRS claimed that we owed
    an incremental tax liability with regard to this audit of
    $110 million, excluding penalties and interest. The
    incremental tax liability primarily relates to transfer pricing
    matters between Symantec and a foreign subsidiary. On
    September 5, 2006, we executed a closing agreement with the
    IRS with respect to the audit of Symantec’s fiscal 2003 and
    2004 federal income tax returns. The closing agreement
    represents the final assessment by the IRS of additional tax for
    these fiscal years of approximately $35 million, including
    interest. Based on the final settlement, a tax benefit of
    $8 million was recognized.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we increased our tax
    reserves by an additional $64 million in connection with
    all open Symantec tax years (fiscal 2003 to 2006). Since these
    reserves relate to licensing arising from acquired technology,
    the additional accruals are primarily offset by deferred taxes.



We are as yet unable to confirm our eligibility to claim a lower
    tax rate on a distribution made from a Veritas foreign
    subsidiary prior to the acquisition. The distribution was
    intended to be made pursuant to the Jobs Act, and therefore
    eligible for a 5.25% effective U.S. federal rate of tax, in
    lieu of the 35% statutory rate. We are seeking a ruling from the
    IRS on the matter. Because we were unable to obtain this ruling
    prior to filing the Veritas tax return in May 2006, we have paid
    $130 million of additional U.S. taxes. Since this
    payment relates to the taxability of foreign earnings that are
    otherwise the subject of the IRS assessment, this additional
    payment reduced the amount of taxes payable accrued as part of
    the purchase accounting for pre-acquisition contingent tax
    risks. For further information, see Note 17 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report and

Critical Accounting Estimates — Income Taxes

above.

In connection with the note hedge transactions discussed in
    Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in this annual report, we established a deferred tax
    asset of approximately $232 million to account for the
    book-tax basis difference in the convertible notes resulting
    from note hedge transactions. The deferred tax asset has been
    accounted for as an increase to Capital in excess of par value.

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation
    No. 48, FIN 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes

, effective March 31, 2007. FIN 48
    addresses the accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in
    income tax positions, by prescribing a minimum recognition
    threshold that a tax position is required to satisfy before
    being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also
    provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification,
    interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
    disclosure and transition.

The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 was a decrease in
    tax reserves of $16 million, resulting in a decrease in
    Veritas goodwill of $10 million, an increase of
    $5 million to Retained Earnings balance, and a
    $1 million increase in Capital in excess of par value. Upon
    adoption, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at
    March 31, 2007 was $456 million, exclusive of interest
    and penalties.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Sources
    of Cash

We have historically relied primarily on cash flow from
    operations, borrowings under a credit facility, issuances of
    convertible notes and equity securities for our liquidity needs.
    Key sources of cash include earnings from operations and
    existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and our
    revolving credit facility.

In July 2006, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior
    unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in July 2011.
    During fiscal 2008, we borrowed $200 million under the
    credit facility. In order to maintain availability to draw on
    the credit facility, we must maintain certain covenants,
    including a specified ratio of debt to earnings before interest,
    taxes, depreciation, and amortization as defined as well as
    various other non-financial covenants. As of March 28,
    2008, we were in compliance with these covenants.

As of March 28, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents of
    $1.9 billion and short-term investments of
    $537 million resulting in a net liquidity position (unused
    availability of the credit facility, cash and cash equivalents
    and short-term investments) of $3.2 billion.

We believe that our cash balances, cash that we generate over
    time from operations, and our borrowing capacity will be
    sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working
    capital and capital expenditures for at least the next
    12 months.

Uses of
    Cash

Our principal cash requirements include working capital, capital
    expenditures, payments of principal and interest on our debt and
    payments of taxes. In addition, we regularly evaluate our
    ability to repurchase stock, pay debts and acquire other
    businesses.

Acquisition-Related.

We generally use cash to
    fund the acquisition of other businesses and from time to time
    use our revolving credit facility when necessary. In April 2007,
    we acquired the outstanding common stock of



Altiris, Inc. and paid $841 million, net of cash acquired,
    which reflects $165 million of cash acquired and
    $17 million of cash paid for transaction costs. In November
    2007, we acquired Vontu, Inc. and paid $298 million, net of
    cash acquired. We used $200 million borrowed under a
    five-year, $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit
    facility to partially fund the purchase. In January 2008, we
    acquired Transparent Logic Technologies, Inc., and paid
    $12 million in cash. During fiscal 2007, we paid cash of
    $33 million for the acquisitions of other businesses.
    During fiscal 2006, we had net sales of available-for-sale
    securities of $3.4 billion and cash of $541 million
    acquired through the acquisition of Veritas, net of cash
    expenditures for our other acquisitions in fiscal 2006. In
    connection with the Veritas acquisition, we assumed
    Veritas’ 0.25% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or the
    Veritas 0.25% Notes, with a principal amount of
    $520 million due August 1, 2013, and a short-term loan
    with a principal amount of euros 411 million, which was
    paid in its entirety in fiscal 2006. In August 2006, we
    repurchased all $520 million of the Veritas
    0.25% notes with cash, which reflected principal plus
    interest.

Stock Repurchases.

During fiscal 2008, we
    repurchased a total of 81 million shares, or
    $1.5 billion, of our Company’s common stock. At
    March 28, 2008 we have $1 billion remaining under the
    plan authorized by the Board of Directors in June 2007.

Issuance of Convertible Senior Notes.

In June
    2006, we issued $1.1 billion principal amount of
    0.75% Convertible Senior Notes (“Senior Notes”)
    due June 15, 2011, and $1.0 billion principal amount
    of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2013,
    to initial purchasers in a private offering for resale to
    qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A.
    Concurrently with the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered
    into note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain of the
    initial purchasers whereby we have the option to purchase up to
    110 million shares of our common stock at a price of $19.12
    per share.

Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2008
    resulted largely from net income of $464 million, plus
    non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of
    $824 million, non-cash stock-based compensation expense of
    $164 million, income taxes payable of $197 million and
    an increase in deferred revenue of $127 million. These
    amounts were partially offset by a decrease in non-cash deferred
    income taxes of $180 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2007
    resulted largely from net income of $404 million, plus
    non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of
    $811 million, non-cash stock-based compensation expense of
    $154 million, and an increase in deferred revenue of
    $400 million. These amounts were partially offset by a
    decrease in income taxes payable of $182 million, primarily
    due to the timing of tax payments.

Investing
    Activities

Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007:

Cash used
    for investing activities was $1.5 billion for 2008 compared
    to $222 million for 2007. Cash used in fiscal 2008
    primarily related to an aggregate payment of $1.2 billion
    in cash for acquisitions which included Altiris for
    $841 million and Vontu for $298 million and the joint
    venture with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. for
    $150 million. During fiscal 2007, we paid $33 million
    for acquisitions of other businesses. Cash used in fiscal 2007
    primarily related to the net increase in property and equipment
    partially offset by the net purchase of short-term investments.
    Both periods reflect consistent levels of capital purchasing
    partially offset by proceeds from the sale of exited or excess
    facilities.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006:

Cash used
    in investing activities was $222 million in fiscal 2007
    compared to cash provided by investing activities of
    $3.6 billion for 2006. Cash used in fiscal 2007 for the
    acquisition of other businesses was $33 million compared to
    cash provided by investing activities of $541 million
    acquired through the acquisition of Veritas, net of cash
    expenditures for our other acquisitions in fiscal 2006.
    Additionally, we recognized net proceeds from sales of
    available-for-sale securities of $3.4 billion during fiscal
    2006, which was primarily associated with the liquidation of
    assets assumed in the acquisition of Veritas.

Financing
    Activities

Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007:

Cash used
    in financing was $1.1 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to
    $1.3 billion in 2007. Cash used in fiscal 2008 primarily
    related to the repurchase of 81 million shares of our
    common stock for $1.5 billion which was partially offset by
    the net proceeds of $224 million received from the issuance
    of our common stock through employee stock plans and the
    $200 million borrowed under the senior unsecured revolving
    credit facility to finance the Vontu acquisition. Cash used in
    fiscal 2007 primarily related to the repurchase of
    162 million shares of our common stock for
    $2.8 billion whereby $1.5 billion was funded by the
    proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes for
    $2.1 billion. Also during fiscal 2007, we purchased hedges
    related to the Senior Notes for $592 million and paid
    $520 million for the repurchase of Veritas
    0.25% Convertible



Subordinated Notes, or the 0.25% Notes assumed in the
    Veritas acquisition; these amounts were partially offset by
    $326 million received from the sale of common stock
    warrants and $230 million received from the issuance of our
    common stock through employee stock plans.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006:

During
    fiscal 2006, we repurchased 174 million shares of our
    common stock for $3.6 billion and repaid the entire balance
    of $491 million from a short-term loan assumed in the
    Veritas acquisition, partially offset by $210 million in
    proceeds from the issuance of our common stock through employee
    stock plans.

Purchase
    price adjustment

As a result of Company-i meeting target billings conditions in
    the first quarter of fiscal 2008, as was stipulated in the
    Company-i merger agreement, we paid the former shareholders of
    Company-i an additional $11 million in cash. This increase
    in purchase price resulted in a respective increase in goodwill.

Convertible
    senior notes

Holders of the Senior Notes may convert their Senior Notes prior
    to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon
    conversion, we would pay the holder the cash value of the
    applicable number of shares of Symantec common stock, up to the
    principal amount of the note. Amounts in excess of the principal
    amount, if any, may be paid in cash or in stock at our option.
    As of March 28, 2008, the conditions to convertibility of
    the Senior Notes had not been met.

Royalties

We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment
    and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally
    based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of
    underlying revenue. Certain royalty commitments have minimum
    commitment obligations; however, as of March 28, 2008 all
    such obligations are insignificant.

Indemnification

As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we
    indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or
    occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at
    our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of
    future payments we could be required to make under these
    indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have
    directors and officers’ insurance coverage that reduces our
    exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future
    amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these
    indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance
    coverage is minimal.

We provide limited product warranties and the majority of our
    software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify
    licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from
    claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual
    property rights of a third party. Historically, payments made
    under these provisions have been immaterial. We monitor the
    conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a
    loss has occurred.

Newly
    Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Recent
    accounting pronouncements

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162,

The
    Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

SFAS No. 162 defines the order in which accounting
    principles that are generally accepted should be followed.
    SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days following the
    SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (“PCAOB”) amendments to AU Section 411,

The Meaning of

Present Fairly in Conformity with
    Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We do not expect the
    adoption of SFAS No. 162 to have a material impact on
    our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2008, the FASB finalized Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

No. 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets.

The position amends the factors that should be considered in
    developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine
    the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB
    Statement of Financial



Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 142,

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets.

The position applies to
    intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group
    of other assets and both intangible assets acquired in business
    combinations and asset acquisitions.

FSP 142-3

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are
    currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of

FSP 142-3

on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133

.
    SFAS No. 161 requires disclosures of how and why an
    entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments
    and related hedged items are accounted for and how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s
    financial position, financial performance, and cash flows.
    SFAS No. 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2008, with early adoption permitted. We
    are currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of
    SFAS No. 161 on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51.

The standard
    changes the accounting for noncontrolling (minority) interests
    in consolidated financial statements including the requirements
    to classify noncontrolling interests as a component of
    consolidated stockholders’ equity, to identify earnings
    attributable to noncontrolling interests reported as part of
    consolidated earnings, and to measure the gain or loss on the
    deconsolidated subsidiary using the fair value of the
    noncontrolling equity investment. Additionally,
    SFAS No. 160 revises the accounting for both increases
    and decreases in a parent’s controlling ownership interest.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited. We
    do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 to have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised “R”),

Business Combinations

. This
    standard changes the accounting for business combinations by
    requiring that an acquiring entity measures and recognizes
    identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the
    acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions. The changes
    include the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs,
    the valuation of any noncontrolling interest at acquisition date
    fair value, the recording of acquired contingent liabilities at
    acquisition date fair value and the subsequent re-measurement of
    such liabilities after acquisition date, the recognition of
    capitalized in-process research and development, the accounting
    for acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals subsequent
    to acquisition date, and the recognition of changes in the
    acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance.
    SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, with early adoption
    prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact of the
    pending adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) on our
    consolidated financial statements. The accounting treatment
    related to pre-acquisition uncertain tax positions will change
    when SFAS No. 141(R) becomes effective, which will be
    in first quarter of our fiscal year 2010. At such time, any
    changes to the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax
    positions related to pre-acquisition periods will be recorded
    through income tax expense, where currently the accounting
    treatment would require any adjustment to be recognized through
    the purchase price. See Note 17 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

In August 2007, the FASB issued proposed FASB “FSP”
    No. APB

14-a,

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement)

. The proposed FSP would require the issuer of
    convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features to
    separately account for the liability and equity components of
    the instrument. The debt would be recognized at the present
    value of its cash flows discounted using the issuer’s
    nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance. The
    equity component would be recognized as the difference between
    the proceeds from the issuance of the note and the fair value of
    the liability. The proposed FSP would also require an accretion
    of the resultant debt discount over the expected life of the
    debt. The proposed transition guidance requires retrospective
    application to all periods presented, and does not grandfather
    existing instruments. In March 2008, the FASB approved moving
    the proposed FSP to final guidance. The final guidance will be
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, and interim periods within those years. Entities will be
    required to apply guidance retrospectively for all periods
    presented. If the FSP is issued as proposed, we expect the
    increase in non-cash interest expense recognized on our
    consolidated financial statements to be significant.



In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities, including an amendment of SFAS No. 115.

SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to
    measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at
    fair value and requires unrealized gains and losses on items for
    which the fair value option has been elected to be reported in
    earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently in the
    process of evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 159 on
    our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements.

SFAS No. 157
    establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets
    and liabilities. This framework is intended to provide increased
    consistency in how fair value determinations are made under
    various existing accounting standards which permit, or in some
    cases require, estimates of fair market value.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those
    fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 157-1,

Application of SFAS No. 157 to SFAS No. 13
    and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value
    Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement
    under SFAS No. 13 and FSP

No. FAS 157-2,

Effective Date of SFAS No. 157. Collectively, the
    Staff Positions defer the effective date of
    SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008, for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
    liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at
    fair value on a recurring basis at least annually, and amend the
    scope of SFAS 157. We are currently evaluating the impact
    of the pending adoption of SFAS 157 on our consolidated
    financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”) Issue

No. 06-1,

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Service Provider to a
    Manufacturer or Reseller of Equipment Necessary for an
    End-Customer to Receive Service from the Service Provider.

EITF Issue

No. 06-1

requires that we provide disclosures regarding the nature of
    arrangements in which we provide consideration to manufacturers
    or resellers of equipment necessary for an end-customer to
    receive service from us, including the amounts recognized in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income. EITF Issue

No. 06-1

is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
    2007. We do not expect the adoption of EITF Issue

No. 06-1

to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations
    in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity
    prices. We may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate
    certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign
    exchange policies. We do not use derivatives or other financial
    instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our
    short-term investment portfolio and the potential losses arising
    from changes in interest rates. Our investment objective is to
    achieve the maximum return compatible with capital preservation
    and our liquidity requirements. Our strategy is to invest our
    cash in a manner that preserves capital, maintains sufficient
    liquidity to meet the cash requirements of the company,
    maximizes yields consistent with approved credit risk, and
    limits inappropriate concentrations of investment by sector,
    credit, or issuer. We classify our cash equivalents and
    short-term investments in accordance with
    SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in
    Debt and Equity Securities.

We consider investments in
    instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days
    or less to be cash equivalents. We classify our short-term
    investments as available-for-sale, and short-term investments
    consist of marketable debt or equity securities with original
    maturities in excess of 90 days. Our cash equivalents and
    short-term investment portfolios consist primarily of money
    market funds, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, and
    U.S. government and government-sponsored debt securities.
    Our short-term investments do not include equity investments in
    privately held companies. Our short-term investments are
    reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of
    tax, included in Accumulated other comprehensive income within
    Stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments,
    realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be
    other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are
    included in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income. We use the specific identification method
    to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon
    sale of short-term investments.



The following table presents the fair value and hypothetical
    changes in fair values on short-term investments sensitive to
    changes in interest rates (in millions):

The modeling technique used above measures the change in fair
    market value arising from selected potential changes in interest
    rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel
    shifts in the yield curve of plus 150 bps, plus
    100 bps, plus 50 bps, minus 25 bps, and minus
    75 bps.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We conduct business in 36 currencies through our worldwide
    operations and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency
    exposure risk. Foreign currency risks are associated with our
    cash and cash equivalents, investments, receivables, and
    payables denominated in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in
    exchange rates will result in foreign exchange gains and losses
    on these foreign currency assets and liabilities and are
    included in Other income (expense), net. Our objective in
    managing foreign exchange activity is to preserve stockholder
    value by minimizing the risk of foreign currency exchange rate
    changes. Our strategy is to primarily utilize forward contracts
    to hedge foreign currency exposures. Under our program, gains
    and losses in our foreign currency exposures are offset by
    losses and gains on our forward contracts. Our forward contracts
    generally have terms of 35 days or less. At the end of the
    reporting period, open contracts are marked-to-market with
    unrealized gains and losses included in Other income (expense),
    net.

The following table presents a sensitivity analysis on our
    foreign forward exchange contract portfolio using a statistical
    model to estimate the potential gain or loss in fair value that
    could arise from hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of
    foreign currency (in millions):

Equity
    Price Risk

In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion principal amount of
    0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 and
    $1.0 billion of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due
    2013. Holders may convert their Senior Notes prior to maturity
    upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion,
    we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number
    of shares of Symantec common stock, up to the principal amount
    of the note. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any,
    may be paid in cash or in stock at our option. Concurrent with
    the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered into convertible
    note hedge transactions and separately, warrant transactions, to
    reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the Senior
    Notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may
    have on the price of our common stock.



For business and strategic purposes, we also hold equity
    interests in several privately held companies, many of which can
    be considered to be in the

start-up

or
    development stages. These investments are inherently risky and
    we could lose a substantial part or our entire investment in
    these companies. These investments are recorded at cost and
    classified as Other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. As of March 28, 2008, these investments had an
    aggregate carrying value of $6 million.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The SEC defines the term “disclosure controls and
    procedures” to mean a company’s controls and other
    procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
    to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under
    the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and
    reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms. “Disclosure controls and procedures”
    include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in
    the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management,
    including its principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded, based on an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) by our
    management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, that our disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
    period covered by this report.

(b)

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) for Symantec.
    Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an
    evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting as of March 28, 2008, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO).

Our management has concluded that, as of March 28, 2008,
    our internal control over financial reporting was effective
    based on these criteria.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
    has issued an attestation report regarding its assessment of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    March 28, 2008, which appears on page 66.

(c)

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting during the quarter ended March 28, 2008 that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(d)

Limitations
    on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors
    and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
    and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
    assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
    Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
    that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
    controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of
    the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
    of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
    issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have
    been detected.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements




REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Symantec Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    March 28, 2008 and March 30, 2007, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended March 28, 2008. In connection
    with our audits of the consolidated financial statements we have
    also audited the related financial statement schedule listed in
    Item 15. These consolidated financial statements and
    financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
    statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    March 28, 2008 and March 30, 2007, and the results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended March 28, 2008, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
    in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective March 31, 2007, the Company adopted
    the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes

. Also discussed in Note 1, effective
    April 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    March 28, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), and our report dated May 20, 2008
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Symantec Corporation:

We have audited Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the
    Company) internal control over financial reporting as of
    March 28, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of March 28, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Symantec Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of March 28, 2008 and March 30, 2007,
    and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
    flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    March 28, 2008, and our report dated May 20, 2008
    expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
    statements.

SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Symantec Corporation (“we,” “us,” and
    “our” refer to Symantec Corporation and all of its
    subsidiaries) is a global leader in providing security, storage
    and systems management solutions to help businesses and
    consumers secure and manage their information. We provide
    customers worldwide with software and services that protect,
    manage and control information risks related to security, data
    protection, storage, compliance, and systems management. We help
    our customers manage cost, complexity and compliance by
    protecting their IT infrastructure as they seek to maximize
    value from their IT investments.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Symantec
    Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are prepared in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
    United States. All significant intercompany accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
    the current presentation. As of March 30, 2007, we had
    $16 million of deferred compensation plan assets that were
    reclassified from Short term investments to Other current assets.

Business
    Combinations

In fiscal 2008, we acquired Altiris Inc, a publicly-held
    company, and two privately-held companies. In fiscal 2007, we
    acquired two privately-held companies. Each of these was
    accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under
    SFAS No. 141

Business Combinations

. Each
    acquired company’s operating results are included in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements since the date
    of acquisition. The purchase price is allocated to tangible and
    identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    as of the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognized for the
    remaining unallocated purchase price.

Amounts allocated to assets are based upon fair values. Such
    valuations require management to make significant estimates and
    assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.
    Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions
    believed to be reasonable. These estimates are based on
    historical experience and information obtained from the
    management of the acquired companies and are inherently
    uncertain. Other separately identifiable intangible assets
    generally include acquired product rights, developed technology,
    customer lists and tradenames. The Company did not assume
    in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) in
    the fiscal years 2008 and 2007. Other intangible assets are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives using a
    straight-line method. Amortization for acquired product rights
    is recognized in “Cost of revenues.” Amortization for
    customer lists and tradenames is recognized in “Operating
    expenses.”

Amounts allocated to liabilities assumed are based upon present
    values of amounts to be paid determined at current market rates.
    The Company estimates the fair value of deferred revenue related
    to product support assumed in connection with acquisitions. The
    estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by
    estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus
    a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the
    support contracts are based on the historical direct costs
    related to providing the support.

For any given acquisition, we may identify certain
    pre-acquisition contingencies. If the contingency is probable
    and can be reasonably estimated within the purchase price
    allocation period, generally within one year after acquisition,
    an adjustment is recorded to goodwill. If the contingency is not
    probable or cannot be reasonably estimated at the end of the
    purchase price allocation period, the adjustment is recorded in
    operating results in the period in which the adjustment is
    determined.

Fiscal
    Years

We have a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to
    March 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in
    this report relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years.

March 30, 2007



March 31, 2006


The fiscal year ending April 3, 2009 will comprise
    53 weeks of operations.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
    United States requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
    financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based
    upon historical factors, current circumstances and the
    experience and judgment of management. Management evaluates its
    assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may engage
    outside subject matter experts to assist in its valuations.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant
    items subject to such estimates and assumptions include those
    related to the allocation of revenues between recognized and
    deferred amounts, carrying values of goodwill, intangible assets
    and long-lived assets, valuation of stock-based compensation,
    and the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally
    the local currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in
    foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate on the
    balance sheet dates. Revenues and expenses are translated using
    monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the year. The
    translation adjustments resulting from this process are included
    as a component of Stockholders’ equity in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains and
    losses are included in Other income (expense), net, in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred tax assets
    (liabilities) are established on the cumulative translation
    adjustment attributable to unremitted foreign earnings that are
    not intended to be indefinitely reinvested.

Revenue
    Recognition

We market and distribute our software products both as
    stand-alone software products and as integrated product suites.
    We recognize revenue when the following conditions have been met:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists

•

Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered

•

Collection of a fixed or determinable amount is considered
    probable

If we determine that any one of the three criteria is not met,
    we will defer recognition of revenue until all the criteria are
    met.

We derive revenue primarily from sales of content,
    subscriptions, and maintenance and licenses. We present revenue
    net of sales taxes and any similar assessments.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue includes
    arrangements for software maintenance and technical support for
    our products, content and subscription services primarily
    related to our security products, revenue from arrangements
    where vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of the fair
    value of undelivered elements does not exist, and arrangements
    for managed security services. These arrangements are generally
    offered



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

to our customers over a specified period of time, and we
    recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance,
    subscription, or service period.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue also includes
    professional services revenue, which consists primarily of the
    fees we earn related to consulting and educational services. We
    generally recognize revenue from professional services as the
    services are performed or upon written acceptance from
    customers, if applicable, assuming all other conditions for
    revenue recognition noted above have been met.

License revenue is derived primarily from the licensing of our
    various products and technology. We generally recognize license
    revenue upon delivery of the product, assuming all other
    conditions for revenue recognition noted above have been met.

We enter into perpetual software license agreements through
    direct sales to customers and indirect sales with distributors
    and resellers. The license agreements generally include product
    maintenance agreements, for which the related revenue is
    included with Content, subscriptions, and maintenance and is
    deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the
    agreements.

In arrangements that include multiple elements, including
    perpetual software licenses and maintenance

and/or

services and packaged products with content updates, we allocate
    and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on VSOE of
    fair value of the undelivered elements, and recognize the
    difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount
    deferred for the undelivered items as license revenue. VSOE of
    each element is based on the price for which the undelivered
    element is sold separately. We determine fair value of the
    undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our
    stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the
    stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements. When VSOE does
    not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance, the entire
    arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance
    period. Our deferred revenue consists primarily of the
    unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance, consumer
    product content update subscriptions, and arrangements where
    VSOE does not exist.

Indirect
    channel sales

For our Consumer Products segment, we sell packaged software
    products through a multi-tiered distribution channel. We also
    sell electronic download and packaged products via the Internet.
    We separately sell annual content update subscriptions directly
    to end-users primarily via the Internet. For our consumer
    products that include content updates, we recognize revenue for
    these products ratably over the term of the subscription upon
    sell-through to end-users. For most other consumer products, we
    recognize package product revenue on distributor and reseller
    channel inventory that is not in excess of specified inventory
    levels in these channels. We offer the right of return of our
    products under various policies and programs with our
    distributors, resellers, and end-user customers. We estimate and
    record reserves for product returns as an offset to revenue. We
    fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channel
    as an offset to deferred revenue.

For our Security and Compliance and Storage and Server
    Management segments, we generally recognize revenue from the
    licensing of software products through our indirect sales
    channel upon sell-through or with evidence of an end-user. For
    licensing of our software to OEMs, royalty revenue is recognized
    when the OEM reports the sale of the software products to an
    end-user, generally on a quarterly basis. In addition to license
    royalties, some OEMs pay an annual flat fee

and/or

support royalties for the right to sell maintenance and
    technical support to the end-user. We recognize revenue from OEM
    support royalties and fees ratably over the term of the support
    agreement.

We offer channel and end-user rebates for our products. Our
    estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are
    based on distributors’ and resellers’ actual
    performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive
    rebate programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our
    reserves for end-user rebates are estimated based on the terms
    and conditions of the promotional program, actual sales during
    the promotion, amount of actual redemptions received, historical
    redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program,
    and



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

the value of the rebate. We estimate and record reserves for
    channel and end-user rebates as an offset to revenue. For
    consumer products that include content updates, rebates are
    recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the term of the
    subscription.

Cash
    Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

We classify our cash equivalents and short-term investments in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or
    SFAS, No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in
    Debt and Equity Securities.

We consider investments in
    instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days
    or less to be cash equivalents. Our short-term investments
    consist of marketable debt or equity securities with original
    maturities in excess of 90 days and are classified as
    available-for-sale. Our cash equivalents and short-term
    investment portfolios consist primarily of money market funds,
    commercial paper, and other investments. Our short-term
    investments do not include equity investments in privately held
    companies. Our short-term investments are reported at fair value
    with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in
    Accumulated other comprehensive income within Stockholders’
    equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of
    premiums and discounts on the investments, realized gains and
    losses, and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary
    on available-for-sale securities are included in Other income
    (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We use
    the specific identification method to determine cost in
    calculating realized gains and losses upon sale of short-term
    investments.

Trade
    Accounts Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
    and are not interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for
    doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible trade
    receivables. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts
    are recorded as General and administrative expenses. We review
    our trade receivables by aging category to identify specific
    customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In
    addition, we maintain an allowance for all other receivables not
    included in the specific reserve by applying specific
    percentages of projected uncollectible receivables to the
    various aging categories. In determining these percentages, we
    analyze our historical collection experience and current
    economic trends. We exercise judgment when determining the
    adequacy of these reserves as we evaluate historical bad debt
    trends, general economic conditions in the U.S. and
    internationally, and changes in customer financial conditions.
    We also offset deferred revenue against accounts receivable when
    channel inventories are in excess of specified levels and for
    transactions where collection of a receivable is not considered
    probable.

Equity
    Investments

We have equity investments in privately held companies for
    business and strategic purposes. We account for non-marketable
    equity securities and other investments under the cost method
    or, if we have the ability to exert significant influence over
    the investee, utilizing the equity method. Cost method
    investments are included in Other long-term assets in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the cost method, the
    investment is recorded at its initial cost and is periodically
    evaluated for impairment. During our review for impairment, we
    examine the investees’ actual and forecasted operating
    results, financial position, and liquidity, as well as
    business/industry factors in assessing whether a decline in
    value of an equity investment has occurred that is
    other-than-temporary. When such a decline in value is
    identified, the fair value of the equity investment is estimated
    based on the preceding factors and an impairment loss is
    recognized in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income. In fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, we
    recognized impairment losses on our cost method equity
    investments of $1 million, $3 million, and
    $4 million, respectively. We account for the
    Huawei-Symantec joint venture under the equity method. This
    investment is included in Investment in joint venture in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the equity method, we record
    our proportionate share of the joint venture’s net income
    or loss, based on the quarterly financial statements of the
    joint venture. See Note 5 for further details.



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Each quarter, we assess our compliance with accounting guidance,
    including the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    Interpretation No. 46R, or FIN 46R,

Consolidation
    of Variable Interest Entities — An Interpretation of
    ARB No. 51.

Under FIN 46R, we must consolidate a
    variable interest entity if we have a variable interest (or
    combination of variable interests) in the entity that will
    absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receive
    a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or
    both. Currently, our equity investments are not subject to
    consolidation under FIN 46R.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

We utilize hedging to mitigate our foreign currency exposures,
    and we manage certain residual exposures through the use of
    one-month forward foreign exchange contracts. We enter into
    forward foreign exchange contracts with high-quality financial
    institutions primarily to minimize currency exchange risks
    associated with certain balance sheet positions denominated in
    foreign currencies. We do not utilize derivative instruments for
    trading or speculative purposes. Gains and losses on the
    contracts are included in Other income (expense), net in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income in the period that gains and
    losses on the underlying maturing forward transactions are
    recognized. The gains and losses on the contracts generally
    offset the gains and losses on the underlying transactions.
    Changes in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts
    are included in earnings. We do not hedge our foreign currency
    translation risk.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
    principally determined using the

first-in,

first-out method. Inventory predominantly consists of finished
    goods as well as deferred costs of revenue. Deferred costs of
    revenue were $32 million at March 28, 2008 and
    $40 million at March 30, 2007, of which
    $22 million and $27 million, respectively, are related
    to consumer products that include content updates and will be
    recognized ratably over the term of the subscription.

Property
    and Equipment

Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements are stated at
    cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.
    Depreciation and amortization is provided on a straight-line
    basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets
    as follows:

•

Computer hardware and software — two to five years

•

Office furniture and equipment — three to five years

•

Leasehold improvements — the shorter of the lease term
    or seven years

•

Buildings — twenty-five to thirty years

Acquired
    Product Rights

Acquired product rights are comprised of purchased product
    rights, technologies, databases, patents, and contracts from
    acquired companies. Acquired product rights are stated at cost
    less accumulated amortization. Amortization of acquired product
    rights is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated
    useful lives of the respective assets, generally one to eight
    years, and is included in Cost of revenues in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

On an annual basis, we evaluate acquired product rights for
    impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the
    net realizable value of the assets, in accordance with
    SFAS No. 86. To determine the net realizable value of
    the assets, we use the estimated future gross revenues from each
    product. Our estimated future gross revenues of each product are
    based on company forecasts and are subject to change. As of
    March 28, 2008 and March 30, 2007, we recorded no
    impairment associated with this analysis.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in
    accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets.

SFAS No. 142 requires that
    goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite
    useful lives be tested for impairment at least annually, or more
    frequently if events and circumstances warrant. We evaluate
    goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of
    our reporting units, which are the same as our operating
    segments, to its carrying value, including the goodwill
    allocated to that reporting unit. To determine the reporting
    units’ fair values in the current year evaluation, we used
    the income approach under which we calculated the fair value of
    each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future
    cash flows of that unit. Our cash flow assumptions are based on
    historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs, and other
    relevant factors. SFAS No. 142 also requires that
    intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized over
    their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for
    impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets.

Long-Lived
    Assets

We account for long-lived assets in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144, which requires that long-lived and
    intangible assets subject to amortization, including Property
    and equipment, net, and Other intangible assets, net, be
    evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
    not be recoverable. We would recognize an impairment loss if the
    sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result
    from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less
    than its carrying amount. Such impairment loss would be measured
    as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and
    its fair value, which would be estimated based on the discounted
    cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Assets to be
    disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets, reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
    fair value less costs to sell, and no longer depreciated. The
    disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented in
    the Other current assets account on the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

Income
    Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. The
    provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and
    liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for
    operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in each jurisdiction
    in which we operate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to
    taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets
    are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation
    allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is
    believed more likely than not to be realized.

We are required to compute our income taxes in each federal,
    state, and international jurisdiction in which we operate. This
    process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as
    well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and
    tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as
    accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax
    purposes. The income tax effects of the differences we identify
    are classified as current or long-term deferred tax assets and
    liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our judgments,
    assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for
    income tax take into account current tax laws, our
    interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of
    current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax
    authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax
    laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could
    significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of
    Income. We must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax
    assets will be realized from future taxable income and, based on
    this assessment, establish a valuation allowance, if required.
    Our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a
    number of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including
    forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and the relative
    proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various
    domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. To
    the extent we establish a

    Statements — (Continued)

valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a
    period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or
    decrease to our tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of
    Income, or to goodwill to the extent that the valuation
    allowance related to tax attributes of the acquired entities.

We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, or
    FIN 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,

effective March 31, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the
    accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum
    recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before
    being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also
    provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification,
    interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
    disclosure and transition.

FIN 48 prescribes a two-step process to determine the
    amount of tax benefit to be recognized. The first step is to
    evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
    weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely
    than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including
    resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
    The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax
    benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of
    being realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently
    difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this
    requires us to determine the probability of various possible
    outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a
    quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including,
    but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes
    in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new
    audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement
    would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an
    additional charge to the tax provision in the period.

Earnings
    Per Share

Earnings per share — basic and diluted are presented
    in conformity with SFAS No. 128,

Earnings per
    Share

, for all periods presented. Earnings per share
    — basic is computed using the weighted-average number
    of common shares outstanding during the periods. Earnings per
    share — diluted is computed using the weighted-average
    number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive
    common shares outstanding during the periods. Potentially
    dilutive common shares include the assumed exercise of stock
    options using the treasury stock method, the dilutive impact of
    restricted stock, restricted stock units, and warrants using the
    treasury stock method, and conversion of debt, if dilutive, in
    the period.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Prior to April 1, 2006, we accounted for stock-based
    compensation awards to employees using the intrinsic value
    method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion,
    or APB, No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees

, and to non-employees using the fair value method
    in accordance with SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation.

In addition, we applied applicable
    provisions of FIN 44,

Accounting for Certain
    Transactions Involving Stock Compensation

, an interpretation
    of APB No. 25.

Effective April 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, which
    replaced SFAS No. 123 and superseded APB No. 25
    and related interpretations. Under SFAS No. 123R, we
    must measure the fair value of all stock-based awards, including
    stock options, restricted stock units, and employee stock
    purchase plan purchase rights, on the date of grant and amortize
    the fair value of the award as compensation expense over the
    requisite service period. We elected the modified prospective
    application method, under which prior periods are not revised
    for comparative purposes. The valuation provisions of
    SFAS No. 123R apply to new awards and to awards
    outstanding as of the effective date that are subsequently
    modified. For stock-based awards granted on or after
    April 1, 2006, we recognize stock-based compensation
    expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
    period, which is generally the vesting period. We recognize
    estimated compensation expense for stock-based awards that were
    outstanding and unvested as of the effective date on a
    straight-line basis over the remaining service period under the
    pro forma provisions of SFAS No. 123.



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we presented
    all tax benefits for deductions related to stock options as
    operating cash flows in our Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires cash flows resulting
    from the tax benefits for tax deductions, in excess of the
    compensation expense recorded for exercised options, to be
    classified as financing cash flows. Accordingly, we classified
    $26 million in both years for such excess tax benefits as
    financing cash flows rather than operating cash flows in our
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the fiscal years ended
    March 28, 2008 and March 30, 2007, respectively.

Pursuant to the income tax guidance included in
    SFAS No. 123R, we have elected the regular method of
    computing the pool of excess tax benefits, or APIC pool.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

A significant portion of our revenues and net income is derived
    from international sales and independent agents and
    distributors. Fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against
    foreign currencies, changes in local regulatory or economic
    conditions, piracy, or nonperformance by independent agents or
    distributors could adversely affect operating results.

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and
    cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade accounts
    receivable, and forward foreign exchange contracts. Our
    investment portfolio is diversified and consists of investment
    grade securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of
    credit risk exposure to any one issuer and in any one country.
    We are exposed to credit risks in the event of default by the
    issuers to the extent of the amount recorded in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. The credit risk in our trade accounts receivable
    is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process,
    reasonably short collection terms, and the geographical
    dispersion of sales transactions. We maintain reserves for
    potential credit losses and such losses have been within
    management’s expectations.

Legal
    Expenses

Prior to October 1, 2006, we recognized a liability for
    cases where we are the defendant for estimated external legal
    costs to be incurred during the next fiscal quarter. Effective
    October 1, 2006, we changed our policy related to legal
    costs from one generally accepted method of accounting to
    another generally accepted method of accounting. Under our new
    policy, we will no longer recognize a liability for external
    legal costs related to future periods. Instead, we will expense
    such amounts in the period incurred. We believe that this new
    policy is preferable because the costs and administrative burden
    involved in estimating future legal expenses outweigh the
    benefits. Further, we believe that this new method more
    accurately aligns the expense with the accounting period in
    which it is incurred. We will continue to accrue amounts related
    to external legal costs that are incurred during the period and
    to accrue losses in the period in which a loss is probable and
    estimable. The impact of this change in accounting method is not
    material for all prior periods presented, and, therefore, prior
    periods have not been revised to reflect this change.

Accumulated
    Other Comprehensive Income

We report comprehensive income or loss in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 130,

Reporting Comprehensive
    Income,

which establishes standards for reporting
    comprehensive income and its components in the financial
    statements. The components of other comprehensive income consist
    of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities,
    net of tax, and foreign currency translation adjustments, net of
    tax. Unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities were
    $3 million and $2 million as of March 28, 2008
    and March 30, 2007, respectively. Comprehensive income is
    presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity and Comprehensive Income.

Newly
    Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162,

The
    Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

SFAS No. 162 defines the order in which accounting
    principles that are generally accepted should be followed.
    SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days following the
    SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (“PCAOB”) amendments to AU Section 411,

The Meaning of

Present Fairly in Conformity with
    Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We do not expect the
    adoption of SFAS No. 162 to have a material impact on
    our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2008, the FASB finalized Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

No. 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets.

The position amends the factors that should be considered in
    developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine
    the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”)
    No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

The
    position applies to intangible assets that are acquired
    individually or with a group of other assets and both intangible
    assets acquired in business combinations and asset acquisitions.

FSP 142-3

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are
    currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of

FSP 142-3

on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133

.
    SFAS No. 161 requires disclosures of how and why an
    entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments
    and related hedged items are accounted for and how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s
    financial position, financial performance, and cash flows.
    SFAS No. 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2008, with early adoption permitted. We
    are currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of
    SFAS No. 161 on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51.

The standard
    changes the accounting for noncontrolling (minority) interests
    in consolidated financial statements including the requirements
    to classify noncontrolling interests as a component of
    consolidated stockholders’ equity, to identify earnings
    attributable to noncontrolling interests reported as part of
    consolidated earnings, and to measure gain or loss on the
    deconsolidated subsidiary using fair value of noncontrolling
    equity investment. Additionally, SFAS No. 160 revises
    the accounting for both increases and decreases in a
    parent’s controlling ownership interest.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited. We
    do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 to have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised “R”),

Business Combinations

. This
    standard changes the accounting for business combinations by
    requiring that an acquiring entity measures and recognizes
    identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the
    acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions. The changes
    include the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs,
    the valuation of any noncontrolling interest at acquisition date
    fair value, the recording of acquired contingent liabilities at
    acquisition date fair value and the subsequent re-measurement of
    such liabilities after acquisition date, the recognition of
    capitalized in-process research and development, the accounting
    for acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals subsequent
    to acquisition date, and the recognition of changes in the
    acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance.
    SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, with early adoption
    prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact of the
    pending adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) on our
    consolidated financial statements. The accounting treatment
    related to pre-acquisition uncertain tax positions will change
    when SFAS No. 141(R) becomes effective, which will be
    in first quarter of our fiscal year 2010. At such time, any
    changes to the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax
    positions related to pre-acquisition periods will be recorded
    through income tax expense, where currently the accounting
    treatment would require any adjustment to be recognized through
    the purchase price. See Note 17 for further details.

In August 2007, the FASB issued proposed FASB “FSP”
    No. APB

14-a,

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement)

. The proposed FSP would require the issuer of
    convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features to
    separately account for the liability and equity components of
    the instrument. The debt would be recognized at the present
    value of its cash flows discounted using the issuer’s
    nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance. The
    equity component would be recognized as the difference between
    the proceeds from the issuance of the note and the fair value of
    the liability. The proposed FSP would also require an accretion
    of the resultant debt discount over the expected life of the
    debt. The proposed transition guidance requires retrospective
    application to all periods presented, and does not grandfather
    existing instruments. In March 2008, the FASB approved moving
    the proposed FSP to final guidance. The final guidance will be
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, and interim periods within those years. Entities will be
    required to apply guidance retrospectively for all periods
    presented. If the FSP is issued as proposed, we expect the
    increase in non-cash interest expense recognized on our
    consolidated financial statements to be significant.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities, including an amendment of SFAS No. 115.

SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to
    measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at
    fair value and requires unrealized gains and losses on items for
    which the fair value option has been elected to be reported in
    earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently in the
    process of evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 159 on
    our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements.

SFAS No. 157
    establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets
    and liabilities. This framework is intended to provide increased
    consistency in how fair value determinations are made under
    various existing accounting standards which permit, or in some
    cases require, estimates of fair market value.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those
    fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 157-1,

Application of SFAS No. 157 to SFAS No. 13
    and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value

    SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008, for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
    liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at
    fair value on a recurring basis at least annually, and amend the
    scope of SFAS 157. We are currently evaluating the impact
    of the pending adoption of SFAS 157 on our consolidated
    financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Service Provider to a
    Manufacturer or Reseller of Equipment Necessary for an
    End-Customer to Receive Service from the Service Provider.

EITF Issue

Advertising
    costs

Advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred and
    include electronic and print advertising, trade shows,
    collateral production, and all forms of direct marketing.
    Starting in January 2007, certain advertising contracts contain
    placement fee arrangements with escalation clauses which are
    expensed on an estimated average cost basis over the term of the
    arrangement. The difference between the actual placement fee
    paid and the estimated average placement fee cost is included in
    Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
    for fiscal 2008 and 2007, which were $71 million and
    $14 million, respectively. Advertising costs included in

Vontu
    Purchase

On November 30, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Vontu
    Inc. (“Vontu”), a provider of data loss prevention
    solutions that assists organizations in preventing the loss of
    confidential or proprietary information. The Vontu products are
    expected to enhance our endpoint and network security and
    storage and compliance solutions offered to customers. In
    exchange for all the voting equity interests, we paid a total
    purchase price of $321 million, which includes
    $14 million in assumed equity awards at fair value,
    $5 million in cash assumed and $4 million for
    acquisition related transaction costs. On November 29,
    2007, we borrowed $200 million under our five-year



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

$1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility to
    partially finance our acquisition of Vontu. See further
    discussion in Note 9.

Of the total purchase price, $259 million was allocated to
    goodwill, $36 million to acquired product rights,
    $33 million to other intangible assets, $10 million to
    net tangible assets and $17 million to deferred tax
    liabilities. Net tangible assets include deferred revenue which
    was adjusted down from $25 million to $2 million
    representing our estimate of the fair value of the support
    contractual obligation assumed. Goodwill, none of which was
    deductible for tax purposes, resulted primarily from our
    expectation of synergies from the integration of Vontu’s
    software offerings with our software offerings. Acquired product
    rights are amortized to cost of revenues over four years. Other
    intangible assets are amortized to operating expenses from three
    to eight years.

Financial results for Vontu are included in the Security and
    Compliance segment. Pro forma disclosures of the financial
    results of Vontu were not included as they were not deemed
    material.

Transparent
    Logic Purchase

On January 11, 2008, we completed the acquisition of
    Transparent Logic Technologies, Inc. (“Transparent
    Logic”), a provider of workflow optimization software.
    Transparent Logic’s products are expected to complement our
    existing products. We purchased all of the voting equity
    interests of Transparent Logic for $12 million, which
    included acquisition related costs. Of the aggregate purchase
    price, $9 million was allocated to goodwill and the
    remainder to other intangible assets, developed technology and
    net tangible assets. Goodwill, none of which was deductible for
    tax purposes, was established based on the expectation of
    synergies from the integration of Transparent Logic’s
    product offerings with our product offerings. The results of
    operations of Transparent Logic are included as part of the
    Security and Compliance segment. Proforma disclosures of the
    financial results of Transparent Logic were not included as they
    were not deemed material.

Company-i
    Purchase

On December 1, 2006, we completed the acquisition of
    Company-i Limited (“Company-i”), a UK-based
    professional services firm that specialized in addressing key
    challenges associated with operating and managing a data center
    for customers in the financial services industry, in exchange
    for all of the voting equity interests of Company-i. Of the
    aggregate $26 million purchase price, $22 million was
    allocated to goodwill, $6 million to other intangible
    assets and the remainder to net deferred tax liabilities and net
    tangible assets. Goodwill, none of which was deductible for tax
    purposes, was established based on the expectation of synergies
    from the integration of Company-i’s service offerings with
    our service offerings. Other intangible assets are amortized to
    operating expenses over eight years. Financial results for
    Company-i are included in the Services segment. Pro forma
    disclosures of the financial results of Company-i were not
    included as they were not deemed material.

As a result of Company-i meeting target billings conditions in
    the first quarter of fiscal 2008, as was stipulated in the
    merger agreement, we paid Company-i an additional
    $11 million in cash. This increase in purchase price
    resulted in a respective increase in goodwill.

4FrontSecurity
    Purchase

On February 23, 2007, we completed the acquisition of
    4FrontSecurity, Inc. (“4FrontSecurity”), a software
    developer and provider of governance, risk management, and
    regulatory compliance products that enables customers to measure
    and manage business and security assessments of organizational
    information. Of the aggregate $7 million purchase price,
    $6 million was allocated to goodwill and the remainder to
    other intangible assets and liabilities. Goodwill, none of which
    was deductible for tax purposes, was established based on the
    expectation of synergies from the integration of
    4FrontSecurity’s technology with our existing product
    offerings. Other intangible assets are amortized to operating
    expenses over seven years. Financial results for 4FrontSecurity

are included in the Security and Compliance segment. Pro forma
    disclosures of the financial results of 4FrontSecurity were not

Note 5.  Investment
    in Joint Venture

On February 5, 2008, Symantec formed Huawei-Symantec, Inc.
    (“joint venture”) with a subsidiary of Huawei
    Technologies Co., Ltd. (“Huawei”). The joint venture
    is domiciled in Hong Kong with principal operations in Chengdu,
    China. We contributed cash of $150 million, licenses
    related to certain intellectual property and other intangible
    assets in exchange for 49% of the outstanding common shares of
    the joint venture. The joint venture will develop, manufacture,
    market and support security and storage appliances to global
    telecommunications carriers and enterprise customers. We
    recorded our initial investment in the joint venture at
    $150 million, reflecting our carrying value of the assets
    contributed in exchange for the common shares received. Huawei
    contributed its telecommunications storage and security business
    assets, engineering, sales and marketing resources, personnel,
    and licenses related intellectual property in exchange for a 51%
    ownership interest in the joint venture.

At March 28, 2008, our carrying value of the investment in
    the joint venture exceeded our proportionate share in the
    underlying net assets of the joint venture. This excess
    primarily relates to differences in the carrying value of the
    net assets contributed by Symantec and Huawei upon the formation
    of the joint venture which will be amortized over the useful
    life of the related assets.

On February 5, 2011, we have a one-time option to purchase
    an additional two percent ownership interest from Huawei for
    $28 million. We determined the value of the option using
    the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The value of the option
    is not considered material to the financial statements and is
    recorded in Investment in joint venture on the Balance Sheet. We
    have concluded that the option does not meet the definition of a
    derivative under SFAS No. 133 “

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

”.
    Symantec and Huawei each have the right to purchase all of the
    other partner’s ownership interest through a bid process
    upon certain triggering events set to occur as early as
    February 5, 2011.

We account for our investment in the joint venture under the
    equity method of accounting. Under this method, we record our
    proportionate share of the joint venture’s net income or
    loss based on the quarterly financial statements of the joint
    venture. We will record our proportionate share of net income or
    loss one quarter in arrears. Therefore, the financial results of
    the joint venture for the period from February 5, 2008
    through March 31, 2008 will be included in our financial
    statements in the quarter ending July 4, 2008.

Note 6.

Loss on
    Sale of Business

During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company determined
    that the Application Performance Management (“APM”)
    business in the Storage and Server Management segment (formerly
    the Data Center Management segment) did not meet the long-term
    strategic objectives of the segment. As a result, the Company
    recognized losses related to the write down of intangible assets
    of $87 million and $6 million in the second and third
    quarters of 2008, respectively. On March 8, 2008, we
    consummated an agreement to sell the tangible and intangible
    assets of approximately $103 million and liabilities of
    approximately $9 million related to the APM business to a
    third-party buyer. The Company further recognized a loss of
    $2 million in the fourth quarter yielding a total loss of
    $95 million recognized during 2008. The APM business did
    not have separately identifiable financial and cash flow
    information and the loss is therefore considered a loss from
    continuing operations. The Company maintains the legal liability
    to fulfill customer contracts that existed as of the sale date;
    however, the Company has subcontracted this responsibility to
    the third-party buyer until the contracts have expired.

As of March 28, 2008, the unrealized losses in the above
    table related to short-term investment securities for which the
    fair value was less than the cost basis. We expect to receive
    the full principal and interest on these securities. We
    regularly review our investment portfolio according to FSP

FAS 115-1

The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its
    Application to Certain Investments

(“FSP

FAS 115-1”).

We identify and evaluate investments that have indications of
    possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a
    loss is temporary include: the length of time and extent to
    which the fair market value has been lower than the cost basis,
    the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee,
    credit quality, and our ability to hold the investment for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery
    in fair market value. The gross unrealized losses related to
    investments are primarily due to a decrease in the fair market
    value of fixed-rate debt securities as a result of changes in
    interest rates. As of March 28, 2008 and March 30,
    2007 we have recorded no write-downs related to other than
    temporary impairments of short-term investment securities.
    Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are
    reported as a component of Stockholders’ equity in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognized net realized losses
    of an insignificant amount for both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007,
    and $5 million in fiscal 2006. These net realized losses
    are included in Interest income.

The estimated fair value of cash equivalents and short-term
    investments by contractual maturity as of March 28, 2008 is
    as follows:

The following table provides the gross unrealized losses and the
    fair market value of our investments with unrealized losses that
    are not deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, aggregated

Equity
    investments in privately held companies

As of March 28, 2008 and March 30, 2007, we held
    equity investments with a carrying value of $6 million and
    $8 million, respectively, in several privately-held
    companies. These investments are recorded at cost as we do not
    have significant influence over the investees and are included
    in Other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In
    fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recognized declines in value of
    these investments that were determined to be
    other-than-temporary, in accordance with FSP

FAS 115-1,

of $1 million, $3 million, and $4 million,
    respectively. The other-than-temporary declines in fair value
    were recorded as Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

Debt

Convertible
    senior notes

In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion principal amount of
    0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2011, or
    the 0.75% Notes, and $1.0 billion principal amount of
    1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2013, or
    the 1.00% Notes, to initial purchasers in a private
    offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant
    to SEC Rule 144A. We refer to the 0.75% Notes and the
    1.00% Notes collectively as the Senior Notes. We received
    proceeds of $2.1 billion from the Senior Notes and incurred
    net transaction costs of approximately $33 million, which
    were allocated proportionately to the 0.75% Notes and the
    1.00% Notes. The transaction costs were primarily recorded
    in other long-term assets and are being amortized to interest
    expense using the effective interest method over five years for
    the 0.75% Notes and seven years for the 1.00% Notes.
    The 0.75% Notes and 1.00% Notes were each issued at
    par and bear interest at 0.75% and 1.00% per annum,
    respectively. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on
    June 15 and December 15, beginning December 15, 2006.

Each $1,000 of principal of the Senior Notes will initially be
    convertible into 52.2951 shares of Symantec common stock,
    which is the equivalent of $19.12 per share, subject to
    adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of
    the Senior Notes may convert their Senior Notes prior to
    maturity during specified periods as follows: (1) during
    any calendar quarter beginning after June 30, 2006, if the
    closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days
    in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
    day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than
    130% of the applicable conversion price per share; (2) if
    specified corporate transactions, including a change in control,
    occur; (3) with respect to the 0.75% Notes, at any
    time on or after April 5, 2011, and with respect to the
    1.00% Notes, at any time on or after April 5, 2013; or
    (4) during the five

business-day

period after any five consecutive

trading-day

period during which the trading price of the Senior Notes falls
    below a certain threshold. Upon conversion, we would pay the
    holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of
    Symantec common stock, up to the principal amount of the note.
    Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid
    in cash or in stock at our option. Holders who convert their
    Senior Notes in connection with a change in control may be
    entitled to a “make whole” premium in the form of an
    increase in the conversion rate. As of March 28, 2008, none
    of the conditions allowing holders of the Senior Notes to
    convert had been met. In addition, upon a change in control of
    Symantec, the holders of the Senior Notes may require us to
    repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Senior Notes for
    100% of the principal amount.

Under the terms of the Senior Notes, we were required to use
    reasonable efforts to file a shelf registration statement
    regarding the Senior Notes with the SEC and cause the shelf
    registration statement to be declared effective within
    180 days of the closing of the offering of the Senior
    Notes. In addition, we must maintain the effectiveness of the
    shelf registration statement for a period of two years after the
    closing of the offering of the Senior Notes. If we fail to meet
    these terms, we will be required to pay additional interest on
    the Senior Notes in the amount of 0.25% per annum. We have filed
    the shelf registration statement with the SEC and it became
    effective on December 11, 2006.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered
    into note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain of the
    initial purchasers whereby we have the option to purchase up to
    110 million shares of our common stock at a price of $19.12
    per share. The options as to 58 million shares expire on
    June 15, 2011 and the options as to 52 million shares
    expire on June 15, 2013. The options must be settled in net
    shares. The cost of the note hedge transactions to us was
    approximately $592 million. In addition, we sold warrants
    to affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers whereby they
    have the option to purchase up to 110 million shares of our
    common stock at a price of $27.3175 per share. The warrants
    expire on various dates from July 2011 through August 2013 and
    must be settled in net shares. We received approximately
    $326 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these
    warrants.

The cost incurred in connection with the note hedge
    transactions, net of the related tax benefit and the proceeds
    from the sale of the warrants, is included as a net reduction in
    Capital in excess of par value in the accompanying

Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 28, 2008, in
    accordance with the guidance in EITF

No. 00-19,

Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to,
    and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock.

In accordance with SFAS No. 128,

Earnings per
    Share

, the Senior Notes will have no impact on diluted
    earnings per share, or EPS, until the price of our common stock
    exceeds the conversion price of $19.12 per share because the
    principal amount of the Senior Notes will be settled in cash
    upon conversion. Prior to conversion, we will include the effect
    of the additional shares that may be issued if our common stock
    price exceeds $19.12 per share using the treasury stock method.
    As a result, for the first $1.00 by which the average price of
    our common stock for a quarterly period exceeds $19.12 per share
    there would be dilution of approximately 5.4 million
    shares. As the share price continues to increase, additional
    dilution would occur at a declining rate such that an average
    price of $27.3175 per share would yield cumulative dilution of
    approximately 32.9 million shares. If the average price of
    our common stock exceeds $27.3175 per share for a quarterly
    period we will also include the effect of the additional
    potential shares that may be issued related to the warrants
    using the treasury stock method. The Senior Notes along with the
    warrants have a combined dilutive effect such that for the first
    $1.00 by which the average price exceeds $27.3175 per share
    there would be cumulative dilution of approximately
    39.5 million shares prior to conversion. As the share price
    continues to increase, additional dilution would occur but at a
    declining rate.

Prior to conversion, the note hedge transactions are not
    considered for purposes of the EPS calculation, as their effect
    would be anti-dilutive. Upon conversion, the note hedge will
    automatically serve to neutralize the dilutive effect of the
    Senior Notes when the stock price is above $19.12 per share. For
    example, if upon conversion the price of our common stock was
    $28.3175 per share, the cumulative effect of approximately
    39.5 million shares in the example above would be reduced
    to approximately 3.9 million shares.

The preceding calculations assume that the average price of our
    common stock exceeds the respective conversion prices during the
    period for which EPS is calculated and exclude any potential
    adjustments to the conversion ratio provided under the terms of
    the Senior Notes. See Note 13 for information regarding the
    impact on EPS of the Senior Notes and warrants in the current
    period.

Line
    of credit

In July 2006, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior
    unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in July 2011.
    Borrowings under the facility bear interest, at our option, at
    either a rate equal to the bank’s base rate or a rate equal
    to LIBOR plus a margin based on our leverage ratio, as defined
    in the credit facility agreement. In connection with the credit
    facility, we must maintain certain covenants, including a
    specified ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
    depreciation, and amortization, as defined, as well as various
    other non-financial covenants.

On November 29, 2007, we borrowed $200 million under
    this credit agreement to partially finance our acquisition of
    Vontu. This outstanding borrowing amount bears interest at
    4.7075% per annum, which is due and payable quarterly. Payment
    of the principal amount is due on November 28, 2008. Total
    interest expense accumulated as of March 28, 2008 is
    approximately $3 million, of which $2 million was paid
    and $1 million was accrued and included in Other current
    liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On
    March 28, 2008, we had $200 million in outstanding
    borrowings included in Short-term borrowings on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets related to this credit facility and were in
    compliance with all of the covenants. There were no borrowings
    under this credit facility at March 30, 2007.

Note 10.

Assets
    Held for Sale

During fiscal 2008, following a review of our real estate
    holdings we determined that certain long-term assets were
    underutilized. As a result, we have committed to sell vacant
    buildings and land with a total carrying value of
    $39 million and no associated liabilities. In accordance
    with the provisions of SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for
    the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

, we
    designated these buildings and land as assets held for sale and



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

included them in Other current assets on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. SFAS No. 144 provides that a
    long-lived asset classified as held for sale should be measured
    at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to
    sell. We recorded a $1 million impairment loss because the
    carrying value was greater than the estimated fair value less
    cost to sell for the year ended March 28, 2008. This
    impairment was included in Research and development expense on
    our Consolidated Statements of Income. We believe that these
    sales will be completed no later than the end of fiscal 2009.

Note 11.

Commitments

Leases

We lease certain of our facilities and equipment under operating
    leases that expire at various dates through 2022. We currently
    sublease some space under various operating leases that will
    expire on various dates through 2018. Some of our leases contain
    renewal options, escalation clauses, rent concessions, and
    leasehold improvement incentives.

Rent expense charged to operations totaled $87 million,
    $83 million, and $70 million in fiscal 2008, 2007, and
    2006, respectively.

Royalties

We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment
    and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally
    based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of
    underlying revenue. Certain royalty commitments have minimum
    commitment obligations; however, as of March 28, 2008 all
    such obligations are not material.

Indemnification

As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we
    indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or
    occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at
    our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of
    future payments we could be required to make under these
    indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have
    directors and officers’ insurance coverage that reduces our
    exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future
    amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these
    indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance
    coverage is minimal.



SYMANTEC

We provide limited product warranties and the majority of our

    licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from
    claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual

    under these provisions have been immaterial. We monitor the
    conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a
    loss has occurred.

Stock
    Transactions

Stock
    repurchases

We have operated stock repurchase programs since 2001. On
    January 24, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of $1 billion of Symantec common stock. As of
    March 30, 2007, $500 million remained authorized for
    future purchases. During the three-month period ended
    June 29, 2007, we repurchased 25 million shares of our
    common stock at prices ranging from $19.42 to $20.16 per share
    which completed the $1 billion share repurchase program
    announced in January 2007.

On June 14, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of $2 billion of Symantec common stock, without
    a scheduled expiration date. During the period between
    June 30, 2007 and March 28, 2008, we repurchased a
    total of 56 million shares of our common stock at prices
    ranging from $16.67 to $19.69 per share for an aggregate amount
    of $1 billion from the authorized repurchase plan.

As a result of the repurchase activity under both the
    January 24, 2007 plan and June 14, 2007 plans, during
    fiscal 2008, we repurchased a total of 81 million shares of
    our common stock at prices ranging from $16.67 to $20.16 per
    share, for an aggregate amount of $1.5 billion. As of
    March 28, 2008, $1 billion remained authorized for
    future repurchases from the June 14, 2007 plan.

During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 162 million shares of
    our common stock at prices ranging from $15.61 to $21.66 per
    share for an aggregate amount of $2.8 billion.

Increase
    to authorized shares

On June 24, 2005, our stockholders approved the adoption of
    our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which
    increased the number of authorized shares of common stock to
    3 billion from 1.6 billion. The increase was sought in
    order to carry out our acquisition of Veritas.

Note 13.

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed on the basis
    of the weighted average number of shares of common stock
    outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share also
    includes the incremental effect of dilutive potential common
    shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock
    method. Dilutive potential common shares include shares
    underlying outstanding stock options, stock awards, warrants,
    and convertible notes.

Adoption
    of Stockholder Rights Plan

On August 11, 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a
    stockholder rights plan designed to ensure orderly consideration
    of any future unsolicited acquisition attempt to ensure a fair
    value of Symantec for our stockholders. In connection with the
    plan, the Board of Directors declared and paid a dividend of one
    preferred share purchase right for each share of Symantec common
    stock outstanding on the record date, August 21, 1998. The
    rights are initially attached to Symantec common stock and will
    not trade separately. If a person or a group, an Acquiring
    Person, acquires 20% or more of our common stock, or announces
    an intention to make a tender offer for 20% or more of our
    common stock, the rights will be distributed and will thereafter
    trade separately from the common stock.



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

If the rights become exercisable, each right (other than rights
    held by the Acquiring Person) will entitle the holder to
    purchase, at a price equal to the exercise price of the right, a
    number of shares of our common stock having a then-current value
    of twice the exercise price of the right. If, after the rights
    become exercisable, we agree to merge into another entity or we
    sell more than 50% of our assets, each right will entitle the
    holder to purchase, at a price equal to the exercise price of
    the right, a number of shares of common stock of such entity
    having a then-current value of twice the exercise price.

We may exchange the rights at a ratio of one share of common
    stock for each right (other than the Acquiring Person) at any
    time after an Acquiring Person acquires 20% or more of our
    common stock but before such person acquires 50% or more of our
    common stock. We may also redeem the rights at our option at a
    price of $0.001 per right at any time before an Acquiring Person
    has acquired 20% or more of our common stock. The rights will
    expire on August 12, 2008.

Note 15.

Employee
    Benefits and Stock-Based Compensation

401(k)
    plan

We maintain a salary deferral 401(k) plan for all of our
    domestic employees. This plan allows employees to contribute up
    to 50% of their pretax salary up to the maximum dollar
    limitation prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. We match 50%
    of the employee’s contribution. The maximum match in any
    given plan year is the lower of 3% of the employees’
    eligible compensation or $6,000. Our contributions under the
    plan were $24 million, $24 million, and
    $12 million, in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Stock
    purchase plans

    Executive Officers’ Stock Purchase Plan

In September 2002, our stockholders approved the 2002 Executive
    Officers’ Stock Purchase Plan and reserved
    250,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder,
    which was amended by our Board of Directors in January 2008. The
    purpose of the plan is to provide executive officers with a
    means to acquire an equity interest in Symantec at fair market
    value by applying a portion or all of their respective bonus
    payments towards the purchase price. As of March 28, 2008,
    40,401 shares have been issued under the plan and
    209,599 shares remain available for future issuance. Shares
    reserved for issuance under this plan have not been adjusted for
    the stock dividends.

    Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In September 1998, our stockholders approved the 1998 Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, and reserved 4 million shares
    of common stock for issuance thereunder. In September 1999, the
    ESPP was amended by our stockholders to increase the shares
    available for issuance by 6 million and to add an
    “evergreen” provision whereby the number of shares
    available for issuance increased automatically on January 1 of
    each year (beginning in 2000) by 1% of our outstanding
    shares of common stock on each immediately preceding December 31
    during the term of the ESPP. In July 2004, the Board of
    Directors eliminated this provision. As of March 28, 2008,
    9.6 million shares remain available for issuance under the
    ESPP.

Subject to certain limitations, our employees may elect to have
    2% to 10% of their compensation withheld through payroll
    deductions to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP.
    Employees purchase shares of common stock at a price per share
    equal to 85% of the fair market value on the purchase date at
    the end of each six-month purchase period. For purchases prior
    to July 1, 2005, employees purchased shares at a price
    equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value as of the
    beginning of the two-year offering period or the end of the
    six-month purchase period. The Board of Directors eliminated the
    two-year offering period in March 2005, effective July 1,
    2005. Under the ESPP, 5 million, 4 million, and
    4 million shares were issued during fiscal 2008, 2007, and
    2006, respectively, representing $69 million,
    $65 million, and $59 million in contributions,
    respectively. As of March 28, 2008, a total of
    29 million shares had been issued under this plan.

2000 Director
    Equity Incentive Plan

In September 2000, our stockholders approved the

    50,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder. In
    September 2004 and September 2007, stockholders increased the
    number of shares of stock that may be issued by 50,000. The
    purpose of this plan is to provide the members of the Board of
    Directors with an opportunity to receive common stock for all or
    a portion of the retainer payable to each director for serving
    as a member. Each director may elect 50% to 100% of the retainer

    Directors, may grant incentive and nonqualified stock options,
    stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, RSUs, or
    restricted stock awards to employees, officers, directors,
    consultants, independent contractors, and advisors to us, or to
    any parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of ours. The purpose of the
    2004 Plan is to attract, retain, and motivate eligible persons
    whose present and potential contributions are important to our
    success by offering them an opportunity to participate in our
    future performance through equity awards of stock options and
    stock bonuses. Under the terms of the 2004 Plan, the exercise
    price of stock options may not be less than 100% of the fair
    market value on the date of grant. Options generally vest over a
    four-year period. Options granted prior to October 2005
    generally have a maximum term of ten years and options granted
    thereafter generally have a maximum term of seven years.

As of March 28, 2008, we have reserved 77 million
    shares for issuance under the 2004 Plan. These shares include
    18 million shares originally reserved for issuance under
    the 2004 Plan upon its adoption by our stockholders in September
    2004, 19 million shares that were transferred to the 2004
    Plan from the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan, (“1996
    Plan”) and 40 million shares that were approved for
    issuance on the amendment and restatement of the 2004 Plan at
    our 2006 annual meeting of stockholders. In addition to the
    shares currently reserved under the 2004 Plan, any shares
    reacquired by us from options outstanding under the 1996 Plan
    upon their expiration will also be added to the 2004 Plan
    reserve. As of March 28, 2008, 41 million shares
    remain available for future grant under the 2004 Plan.

At our 2006 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders
    approved the amendment and restatement of the 2004 Plan, which
    included the following key changes: 1) an increase of
    40 million shares reserved for issuance under the 2004
    Plan; 2) modification of the share pool available under the
    2004 Plan to reflect a ratio-based pool, where the grant of each
    full-value award, such as a share of restricted stock
    (“RSU”), decreases the pool by two shares; and
    3) a change in the form of equity grants to our
    non-employee directors from stock options to a fixed dollar
    amount of RSUs.

Assumed
    Vontu stock options

In connection with our acquisition of Vontu, we assumed all
    unexercised, outstanding options to purchase Vontu common stock.
    Each unexercised, outstanding option assumed was converted into
    an option to purchase Symantec common stock after applying the
    exchange ratio of 0.5351 shares of Symantec common stock
    for each share of Vontu common stock. In total, all unexercised,
    outstanding Vontu options were converted into options to
    purchase approximately 2.2 million shares of Symantec
    common stock. As of March 28, 2008, total unrecognized
    compensation cost adjusted for estimated forfeitures related to
    unexercised, outstanding Vontu stock options was approximately
    $11 million.

Furthermore, all shares obtained upon exercise of unvested Vontu
    options were converted into the right to receive cash of $9.33
    per share upon vesting. The total value of the assumed
    exercised, unvested Vontu options on the date of acquisition was
    approximately $7 million, assuming no options are forfeited
    prior to vesting. As of March 28, 2008, total unrecognized
    compensation cost adjusted for estimated forfeitures related to
    exercised, unvested Vontu stock options was approximately
    $4 million.

    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The assumed options retained all applicable terms and vesting
    periods, except for certain options that were accelerated
    according to a change in control provision and will generally
    vest within a twelve month period from the date of acquisition
    and certain other options that vested in full as of the
    acquisition date. In general, the assumed options typically vest
    over a period of four years from the original date of grant of
    the option and have a maximum term of ten years.

Assumed
    Altiris stock options and awards

In connection with our acquisition of Altiris, we assumed all of
    the outstanding options to purchase Altiris common stock. Each
    option assumed was converted into an option to purchase Symantec
    common stock after applying the exchange ratio of
    1.9075 shares of Symantec common stock for each share of
    Altiris common stock. In total, we assumed and converted Altiris
    options into options to purchase approximately 3 million
    shares of Symantec common stock. In addition, we assumed and
    converted all outstanding Altiris RSUs into approximately
    320,000 Symantec RSUs, based on the same exchange ratio.
    Furthermore, we assumed all outstanding Altiris Restricted Stock
    Awards (“RSAs”) which were converted into the right to
    receive cash in the amount of $33.00 per share upon vesting. The
    total value of the assumed RSAs on the date of acquisition was
    approximately $9 million, assuming no RSAs are forfeited
    prior to vesting. As of March 28, 2008, total unrecognized
    compensation cost adjusted for estimated forfeitures, related to
    the Altiris unvested stock options, RSUs and RSAs, was
    $1 million, $1 million, and $1 million,
    respectively.

The assumed options, RSUs, and RSAs retained all applicable
    terms and vesting periods, except for certain options, RSAs and
    RSUs that were accelerated according to the executive vesting
    plan and will generally vest over a four to twelve month period
    from the date of acquisition and certain other options that
    vested in full as of the acquisition date. In general, the
    assumed options typically vest over a period of three to four
    years from the original date of grant and have a maximum term of
    ten years. The assumed RSUs and RSAs typically vest over a
    period of two to three years from the original date of grant.

Assumed
    Veritas stock options

In connection with our acquisition of Veritas, we assumed each
    outstanding option to purchase Veritas common stock with an
    exercise price equal to or less than $49.00 as well as each
    additional option required to be assumed by applicable law. Each
    option assumed was converted into an option to purchase Symantec
    common stock after applying the exchange ratio of
    1.1242 shares of Symantec common stock for each share of
    Veritas common stock. In total, we assumed and converted Veritas
    options into options to purchase 66 million shares of
    Symantec common stock. In addition, we assumed and converted all
    outstanding Veritas RSUs into approximately 425,000 Symantec
    RSUs based on the same exchange ratio.

The assumed options and RSUs retained all applicable terms and
    vesting periods. In general, the assumed options vest over a
    four-year period from the original date of grant. Options
    granted prior to May 2004 generally have a maximum term of
    10 years and options granted thereafter generally have a
    maximum term of seven years. The assumed RSUs generally vest
    over a three or four year period from the original date of grant.

Other
    stock option plans

Options remain outstanding under several other stock option
    plans, including the 2001 Non-Qualified Equity Incentive Plan,
    the 1999 Acquisition Plan, the 1996 Plan, and various plans
    assumed in connection with acquisitions. No further options may
    be granted under any of these plans.

Acceleration
    of stock option vesting

On March 30, 2006, we accelerated the vesting of certain
    stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than
    $27.00 per share that were outstanding on that date. We did not
    accelerate the vesting of any stock options held by our
    executive officers or directors. The vesting of options to
    purchase approximately 7 million shares of common stock, or
    approximately 14% of our outstanding unvested options, was
    accelerated. The weighted-average exercise price of the stock
    options for which vesting was accelerated was $28.73. We
    accelerated the vesting of the options to



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

reduce future stock-based compensation expense that we would
    otherwise be required to recognize in our results of operations
    after adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Because of system
    constraints, it is not practicable for us to estimate the amount
    by which the acceleration of vesting will reduce our future
    stock-based compensation expense. The acceleration of the
    vesting of these options did not result in a charge to expense
    in fiscal 2006.

Valuation
    of stock-based awards

The fair value of each stock option granted under our equity
    incentive plans and each ESPP purchase right granted prior to
    July 1, 2005 is estimated on the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
    weighted-average assumptions:

The expected life of options is based on an analysis of our
    historical experience of employee exercise and post-vesting
    termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual
    life of the option. Expected volatility is based on the average
    of the historical volatility for the period commensurate with
    the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of
    traded options. The risk free interest rate is equal to the
    U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal
    to the expected life. We do not currently pay cash dividends on
    our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the
    foreseeable future. Accordingly, our expected dividend yield is
    zero. The fair value of each RSU is equal to the market value of
    Symantec’s common stock on the date of grant. The fair
    value of each ESPP purchase right granted from July 1, 2005
    onwards is equal to the 15% discount on shares purchased. We
    estimate forfeitures of options, and RSUs, at the time of grant
    based on historical experience and record compensation expense
    only for those awards that are expected to vest.

As of March 28, 2008, total unrecognized compensation cost
    adjusted for estimated forfeitures related to unvested stock
    options, RSUs, and RSAs, was $144 million,
    $46 million, and $1 million, respectively, which is
    expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average
    vesting periods of 2.5 years for stock options,
    1.4 years for RSUs, and 0.6 years for RSAs.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we provided
    the pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per
    share required by SFAS No. 123. This information was
    required to be determined as if we had accounted for our
    employee stock options, including shares issued under our ESPP,
    granted subsequent to March 31, 1995 under the fair value
    method of SFAS No. 123. We generally did not recognize
    stock-based compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements
    of Income for option grants to our employees for the periods
    prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 123R because the
    exercise price of options granted was equal to the fair market
    value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Prior
    to April 1, 2006, stock-based compensation expense resulted
    primarily from stock options and RSUs assumed in acquisitions
    and restricted stock granted to executives. The following table
    illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as
    if we had applied the

Restructuring

Our restructuring costs consist of severance and benefits and
    facility and other charges. Severance and benefits generally
    include severance, stay-put or one-time bonuses, outplacement
    services, health insurance coverage, effects of foreign currency
    exchange and legal costs. Facilities and other costs generally
    include rent expense less expected sublease income, lease
    termination costs, asset abandonment costs and the effects of
    foreign currency exchange. Restructuring expenses generally do
    not impact a particular reporting segment and are including in
    the “Other” reporting segment.

    Restructuring Plan

In fiscal 2008, management approved and initiated a
    restructuring plan to reduce costs, implement management
    structure changes and optimize the business structure and
    discontinue certain products. Projects within the plan began in
    the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and are expected to be
    completed by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Charges in
    fiscal 2008 related to these events primarily consist of
    severance and other benefit costs. Total remaining costs of the
    restructuring plan, consisting of severance and benefits and
    excess facilities costs, are estimated to range between
    approximately $80 million and $110 million.

    Restructuring Plans

In fiscal 2007, we entered into restructuring plans to
    consolidate facilities and reduce operating costs through
    headcount reductions. Charges in fiscal 2008 related to these
    events consist of severance and other benefits and excess
    facility costs. Employee terminations occurred in the Americas,
    EMEA and Asia Pacific. Charges in fiscal 2007 were
    $69 million in severance and other benefits. Facilities
    charges in fiscal 2007 were not material. As of March 28,
    2008, the majority of employees had been terminated and future
    severance costs are not expected. The Company consolidated
    certain facilities and exited facilities related to earlier
    acquisitions. Facility charges in fiscal 2008 primarily relate
    to exited facilities located in California. Excess facilities
    obligations are expected to be paid through the second quarter
    of fiscal 2010. Future costs for exited facilities associated
    with these events are not expected to be significant.

Prior
    and Acquisition-Related Restructuring Plans

Fiscal Years

2002-2006.

In
    fiscal 2006, management entered into restructuring plans to
    reduce job redundancy in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific
    and to consolidate certain facilities in Europe and Asia
    Pacific. As a result, the Company recognized both severance and
    other benefits and excess facilities costs. Charges recognized
    in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 related to these plans were not
    significant. Charges recognized in fiscal 2006 reflect
    $18 million in severance and benefit costs and
    $7 million in excess facility costs related to exited
    facilities located in Texas and the United Kingdom.
    Restructuring liabilities related to these events as of
    March 28, 2008 and March 30, 2007 were both
    $3 million and are expected to be paid through the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2018.

Acquisition-Related.

Restructuring liabilities
    related to acquisitions as of March 28, 2008 were
    $8 million, consisting primarily of excess facilities
    obligations. During fiscal 2008, $7 million in charges for
    severance and other benefits, primarily related to the Altiris
    acquisition and charges for excess facilities relate to both the
    Vontu and Altiris acquisitions. Of the $8 million
    restructuring liability, $7 million relates to excess
    facilities resulting from the Vontu acquisition and the
    restructuring accrual which the Company assumed in our Veritas
    acquisition in 2005. Further severance and benefit charges are
    not expected to be recognized in future periods. Excess
    facilities obligations are expected to be paid through the
    second quarter of fiscal 2011 and the first quarter of fiscal
    2013 for Altiris and Vontu facilities, respectively. Excess
    facilities obligations related to the Veritas restructurings are
    expected to be paid through the first quarter of fiscal 2014.

Restructuring liabilities related to acquisitions as of
    March 30, 2007 were $6 million, consisting primarily
    of excess facilities obligations primarily related to the
    Veritas acquisition described above. There were no restructuring
    charges related to acquisitions during fiscal 2006 and fiscal
    2007 as the amounts were recognized in the purchase price
    allocations.

Of the $38 million total valuation allowance provided
    against our deferred tax assets, approximately $30 million
    is attributable to acquisition-related assets, the benefit of
    which will reduce goodwill when and if realized. The valuation
    allowance decreased by $22 million in fiscal 2008;
    $19 million was reclassified to unrecognized tax benefits
    within deferred taxes and $3 million was attributable to
    acquisition-related assets.

As of March 28, 2008, we have U.S. federal net
    operating loss and credit carryforwards attributable to various
    acquired companies of approximately $216 million and
    $17 million, respectively, which, if not used, will expire
    between fiscal 2016 and 2027. These net operating loss
    carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Internal
    Revenue Code § 382, but are expected to be fully
    realized. Furthermore, we have U.S. state net operating
    loss and credit carryforwards attributable to various acquired
    companies of approximately $290 million and
    $12 million, respectively, which will expire in various
    fiscal years. In addition, we have foreign net operating loss
    carryforwards attributable to various acquired foreign companies
    of approximately $705 million, which, under current
    applicable foreign tax law, can be carried forward indefinitely.

As of March 28, 2008, no provision has been made for
    federal or state income taxes on $1.3 billion of cumulative
    unremitted earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries,
    since we plan to indefinitely reinvest these earnings. As of
    March 28, 2008, the unrecognized deferred tax liability for
    these earnings was $362 million.

In the March 2005 quarter, we repatriated $500 million from
    certain of our foreign subsidiaries under provisions of the
    American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the Jobs Act, enacted in
    October 2004. We recorded a tax charge for this repatriation of
    $54 million in the March 2005 quarter.

In May 2005, clarifying language was issued by the
    U.S. Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue
    Service, or IRS, with respect to the treatment of foreign taxes
    paid on the earnings repatriated under the Jobs Act and in
    September 2005, additional clarifying language was issued
    regarding the treatment of certain deductions



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

attributable to the earnings repatriation. As a result of this
    clarifying language, we reduced the tax expense attributable to
    the repatriation by approximately $21 million in fiscal
    2006, which reduced the cumulative tax charge on the
    repatriation to $33 million.

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation
    No. 48 (“FIN 48”),

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes

, effective March 31, 2007.
    The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 was a decrease in
    tax reserves of $16 million, resulting in a decrease to
    Veritas goodwill of $10 million, an increase of
    $5 million to the March 31, 2007 Retained Earnings
    balance, and a $1 million increase in Paid in Capital. Upon
    adoption, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at
    March 31, 2007 was $456 million, exclusive of interest
    and penalties.

The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax
    benefits were as follows:

Of the $132 million of changes in gross unrecognized tax
    benefits during the year disclosed above, approximately
    $76 million was provided through purchase accounting in
    connection with acquisitions made in fiscal 2008. This gross
    liability is reduced by offsetting tax benefits associated with
    the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing
    adjustments, interest deductions, and state income taxes, as
    well as payments made to date.

Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at March 28, 2008,
    $122 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the
    company’s effective tax rate while the remaining amounts
    would affect goodwill, cumulative translation adjustments and
    Additional paid in capital. However, one or more of these
    unrecognized tax benefits could be subject to a valuation
    allowance if and when recognized in a future period, which could
    impact the timing of any related effective tax rate benefit.

Our policy to include interest and penalties related to gross
    unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes
    did not change upon the adoption of FIN 48. At
    March 28, 2008, before any tax benefits, we had
    $122 million of accrued interest and $13 million of
    accrued penalties on unrecognized tax benefits. Interest
    included in our provision for income taxes was approximately
    $32 million for the year ended March 28, 2008. If the
    accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable,
    amounts accrued will be reduced in the period that such
    determination is made, and reflected as a reduction of the
    overall income tax provision, to the extent that the interest
    expense had been provided through the tax provision, or as a
    reduction to Goodwill if it had been recorded through purchase
    accounting.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. on a federal basis
    and in many U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two
    most significant tax jurisdictions are the U.S. and
    Ireland. Our tax filings remain subject to examination by
    applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time
    following the tax year to which those filings relate. Our 2000
    through 2007 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS
    for U.S. federal tax purposes, and our 1995 through 2007
    tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate
    governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. Other significant
    jurisdictions include California and Japan. As of March 28,
    2008, we are under examination by the IRS, for the Veritas
    U.S. federal income taxes for the 2002 through 2005 tax
    years.

We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing income tax
    controversies and the impact, if any, of the expected tolling of
    the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.
    Considering these facts, we do not currently believe there is a
    reasonable possibility of any significant change to our total
    unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.



SYMANTEC

On March 29, 2006, we received a Notice of Deficiency from
    the IRS claiming that we owe additional taxes, plus interest and
    penalties, for the 2000 and 2001 tax years based on an audit of
    Veritas. The incremental tax liability asserted by the IRS was
    $867 million, excluding penalties and interest. On
    June 26, 2006, we filed a petition with the U.S. Tax
    Court protesting the IRS claim for such additional taxes. On
    August 30, 2006, the IRS answered our petition and this
    issue has been docketed for trial in U.S. Tax Court and is
    scheduled to begin on June 30, 2008. In the March 2007
    quarter, we agreed to pay $7 million out of
    $35 million originally assessed by the IRS in connection
    with several of the lesser issues covered in the assessment. The
    IRS has also agreed to waive the assessment of penalties. In a
    Motion to Amend filed March 20, 2008, the IRS moved to
    change its position on the remaining issue in the case. If
    allowed, the IRS’ new position would decrease the
    incremental tax liability for the remaining issue to
    approximately $545 million, excluding interest.

We strongly believe the IRS’ position with regard to this
    matter is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and existing
    Treasury regulations, and that our previously reported income
    tax provision for the years in question is appropriate. No
    payments will be made on the assessment until the issue is
    definitively resolved. If, upon resolution, we are required to
    pay an amount in excess of our provision for this matter, the
    incremental amounts due would be accounted for principally as
    additions to the cost of Veritas purchase price. Any incremental
    interest accrued subsequent to the date of the Veritas
    acquisition would be recorded as an expense in the period the
    matter is resolved.

On September 5, 2006, we executed a closing agreement with
    the IRS with respect to the audit of Symantec’s fiscal 2003
    and 2004 federal income tax returns. The closing agreement
    represents the final assessment by the IRS of additional tax for
    these fiscal years of approximately $35 million, including
    interest. Based on the final settlement, a tax benefit of
    $8 million is reflected in the September 2006 quarter.

We are as yet unable to confirm our eligibility to claim a lower
    tax rate on a distribution made from a Veritas foreign
    subsidiary prior to the June 2005 acquisition. The distribution
    was intended to be made pursuant to the Jobs Act, and therefore
    eligible for a 5.25% effective U.S. federal rate of tax, in
    lieu of the 35% statutory rate. We are seeking resolution of
    this matter with the IRS. Because we were unable to confirm our
    eligibility for the lower tax rate prior to filing the Veritas
    tax return in May 2006, we paid $130 million of additional
    U.S. taxes. Since this payment relates to the taxability of
    foreign earnings that are otherwise the subject of the IRS
    assessment, this additional payment reduced the amount of taxes
    payable accrued as part of the purchase accounting for
    pre-acquisition contingent tax risks.

The accounting treatment related to pre-acquisition unrecognized
    tax benefits will change when FAS 141R becomes effective,
    which will be in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2010. At
    such time, any changes to the recognition or measurement of
    unrecognized tax benefits related to pre-acquisition periods
    will be recorded through income tax expense, where currently the
    accounting treatment would require any adjustment to be
    recognized through the purchase price as an increase or decrease
    to goodwill.

Note 18.

Litigation

For a discussion of our pending tax litigation with the Internal
    Revenue Service relating to the 2000 and 2001 tax years of
    Veritas, see Note 17.

On July 7, 2004, a purported class action complaint
    entitled Paul Kuck, et al. v. Veritas Software Corporation,
    et al. was filed in the United States District Court for the
    District of Delaware. The lawsuit alleges violations of federal
    securities laws in connection with Veritas’ announcement on
    July 6, 2004 that it expected results of operations for the
    fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2004 to fall below earlier
    estimates. The complaint generally seeks an unspecified amount
    of damages. Subsequently, additional purported class action
    complaints have been filed in Delaware federal court, and, on
    March 3, 2005, the Court entered an order consolidating
    these actions and appointing lead plaintiffs and counsel. A
    consolidated amended complaint (“CAC”), was filed on
    May 27, 2005, expanding the class period from
    April 23, 2004 through July 6, 2004. The CAC also
    named another officer as a defendant and added allegations that
    Veritas and the named officers made false or misleading
    statements in press releases and SEC filings regarding the
    company’s financial results, which allegedly contained
    revenue recognized from contracts that were unsigned or lacked
    essential terms. The defendants to this matter filed a motion to
    dismiss



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

the CAC in July 2005; the motion was denied in May 2006. In
    April 2008, the parties filed a stipulation of settlement, which
    if approved by the Court will resolve the matter. If the
    settlement is not completed, an adverse outcome in this matter
    could have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows. As of March 28, 2008,
    we have recorded an accrual in the amount of $21.5 million
    for this matter and, pursuant to the terms of the settlement, we
    established a settlement fund of $21.5 million on
    May 1, 2008. The loss is reflected in Settlements of
    litigation in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

After Veritas announced in January 2003 that it would restate
    its financial results as a result of transactions entered into
    with AOL Time Warner in September 2000, numerous separate
    complaints purporting to be class actions were filed in the
    United States District Court for the Northern District of
    California alleging that Veritas and some of its officers and
    directors violated provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934. The complaints contain varying allegations, including that
    Veritas made materially false and misleading statements with
    respect to its 2000, 2001 and 2002 financial results included in
    its filings with the SEC, press releases and other public
    disclosures. A consolidated complaint entitled In Re VERITAS
    Software Corporation Securities Litigation was filed by the lead
    plaintiff on July 18, 2003. On February 18, 2005, the
    parties filed a Stipulation of Settlement in the class action.
    On March 18, 2005, the Court entered an order preliminarily
    approving the class action settlement. Pursuant to the terms of
    the settlement, a $35 million settlement fund was
    established on March 25, 2005. Veritas’ insurance
    carriers provided for the entire amount of the settlement fund.
    In July 2007, the Court of Appeals vacated the settlement,
    finding that the notice of settlement was inadequate. The matter
    has been returned to the District Court for further proceedings,
    including reissuance of the notice. If the settlement is not
    approved, an adverse outcome in this matter could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows.

We are also involved in a number of other judicial and
    administrative proceedings that are incidental to our business.
    Although adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur in one or
    more of the cases, it is not possible to estimate the possible
    loss or losses from each of these cases. During the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2008, we agreed to settle two such lawsuits,
    the net result of which was a gain of $58.5 million
    reflected in Settlements of litigation in the Consolidated
    statements of Income. The final resolution of these lawsuits,
    individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

Note 19.

Segment
    Information

During the March 2008 quarter, we changed our reporting segments
    to align with the new operating structure. The new reporting
    segment structure is as follows: (i) the Security and Data
    Management Group is now known as the Security and Compliance
    segment; (ii) the Altiris segment, in its entirety, has
    been moved into the Security and Compliance segment;
    (iii) the Data Center Management Group is now known as the
    Storage and the Server Management segment; and (iv) we have
    moved the Backup Exec products to the Storage and Server
    Management segment from the Security and Data Management Group.
    All reporting segments are managed by the chief operating
    decision maker, which is our chief operating officer. Our chief
    operating decision maker, manages business operations, evaluates
    performance and allocates resources based on the operating
    segments’ net revenues and operating income. The new
    business structure more directly aligns the operating segments
    with markets and customers, and we believe will establish more
    direct lines of reporting responsibilities, speed decision
    making, and enhance the ability to pursue strategic growth
    opportunities. We revised the business segment information for
    prior years to conform to the new presentation. As of
    March 28, 2008, we operated in five operating segments:

•

Consumer Products.

Our Consumer Products
    segment focuses on delivering our Internet security, PC tuneup,
    and backup products to individual users and home offices.

•

Security and Compliance.

Our Security and
    Compliance segment focuses on providing large, medium, and
    small-sized business with solutions for compliance and security
    management, endpoint security, messaging management, and data
    protection management software solutions that allow our
    customers to secure, provision, backup, and remotely access
    their laptops, PCs, mobile devices, and servers.



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

•

Storage and Server Management.

Our Storage and
    Server Management segment focuses on providing enterprise and
    large enterprise customers with storage and server management,
    data protection, and application performance management
    solutions across heterogeneous storage and server platforms.

•

Services.

Our Services segment provides
    customers with leading IT risk management services and solutions
    to manage security, availability, performance and compliance
    risks across multi-vendor environments. In addition, our
    services including managed security services, consulting,
    education, and threat and early warning systems, help customers
    optimize and maximize their Symantec technology investments.

•

Other.

Our Other segment is comprised of
    sunset products and products nearing the end of their life
    cycle. It also includes general and administrative expenses;
    amortization of acquired product rights, other intangible
    assets, and other assets; charges, such as acquired in-process
    research and development, stock-based compensation,
    restructuring and certain indirect costs that are not charged to
    the other operating segments.

Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments.
    The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
    described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
    There are no intersegment sales. Our chief operating decision
    maker evaluates performance based on direct profit or loss from
    operations before income taxes not including nonrecurring gains
    and losses, foreign exchange gains and losses, and miscellaneous
    other income and expenses. Except for goodwill, as disclosed in
    Note 7, the majority of our assets are not discretely
    identified by segment. The depreciation and amortization of our
    property, equipment, and leasehold improvements are allocated
    based on headcount, unless specifically identified by segment.

    entities. In fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, one distributor, Ingram
    Micro, Inc. (“Ingram Micro”), that accounted for 10%,
    11% and 13%, respectively, of our total net revenues. Our
    distributor arrangements with Ingram Micro consist of several
    non-exclusive, independently negotiated agreements with its
    subsidiaries that cover certain countries or regions. Each of
    these agreements is separately negotiated and is independent of
    any other contract (such as a master distribution agreement),
    and these agreements are not based on the same form of contract.
    None of these contracts was individually responsible for over
    10 percent of our total net revenues in each of the last

Subsequent
    Events

On April 18, 2008, we completed the acquisition of
    AppStream Inc., a leading provider of application streaming
    technology, an on-demand delivery mechanism that leverages the
    power of application virtualization to enable greater
    flexibility and control in the use of endpoint assets within a
    corporation’s IT infrastructure. The aggregate purchase
