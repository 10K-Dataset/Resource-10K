PART I

Item 1.

Business

Symantec is a global leader in infrastructure software, enabling
    businesses and consumers to have confidence in a connected
    world. We help our customers protect their infrastructure,
    information, and interactions by delivering software and
    services that address risks to information security,
    availability, compliance, and information technology, or IT,
    systems performance. We strive to help our customers manage
    compliance, complexity, and cost by protecting their IT
    infrastructure as they seek to maximize value from their IT
    investments.

We deliver a comprehensive and diverse set of security and
    availability products and services to large enterprises,
    governments, small and medium-sized businesses, and consumers on
    a worldwide basis. Our delivery network includes direct, inside,
    and channel sales resources that support our ecosystem of more
    than 50,000 partners worldwide, as well as various
    relationships with original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs,
    Internet service providers, or ISPs, and retail and online
    stores. We operate in three geographic regions: Americas, which
    includes North America, Canada, and Latin America; EMEA, which
    includes Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific Japan.

We operate primarily in two growing, diversified markets within
    the software sector: the security market and the storage
    software market. The security market includes products that
    protect consumers and enterprises from threats to personal
    computers, or PCs, computer networks, and electronic
    information. The storage software market includes products that
    manage, archive, protect, and recover business-critical data. We
    believe that these markets are converging as customers
    increasingly require our help in mitigating their risk profiles
    and managing their storage solutions in order to safeguard their
    IT infrastructure, information, and interactions.

In the ever-changing threat landscape and increasingly complex
    IT environment for consumers and enterprises alike, we believe
    product differentiation will be the key to sustaining market
    leadership. Thus, we continually work to enhance the features
    and functionality of our existing products, extend our product
    leadership, and create innovative solutions for our customers.
    We focus on generating profitable and sustainable growth through
    internal research and development, licensing from third parties,
    and acquisitions of companies with leading technologies.

During fiscal 2007, we took the following actions to support our
    business:

•

We developed and launched several new products and integrated
    new feature functionality into new versions of products, some of
    which include: Norton

tm

,
    Norton Internet
    Security

tm

2007, Norton
    Confidential

tm

,
    Veritas Storage
    Foundation

tm

5.0, Veritas Cluster
    Server

tm

5.0,
    NetBackup

tm

6.0, Symantec Information
    Foundation

tm

2007, Backup
    Exec

tm

11d, and
    Symantec

tm

Security Information Manager. Customers are leveraging our
    broader product portfolio to help them solve the cost,
    complexity, and compliance issues for their IT environments.

•

We expanded our services offerings to provide enterprise
    customers with an extended range of infrastructure management
    options that incorporates best practice and improves IT risk
    management.

•

We merged the Symantec and Veritas enterprise sales forces into
    one integrated sales team. This structure allows better account
    and opportunity coverage, while leveraging our broad product
    portfolio.

•

We consolidated two enterprise resource planning, or ERP,
    systems into a single enhanced system and implemented a new
    buying program in order to drive operational efficiencies and
    create a platform from which we can work to improve the ease of
    transacting business with our customers.

•

We consolidated three of our enterprise business segments into
    two segments and now operate in five operating segments. During
    fiscal 2008, we will also operate in a new segment consisting of
    our Altiris business, which was acquired in April 2007, and we
    will realign some of our existing segments. See Note 15 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more
    information.

•

In January 2007, we announced plans to reduce our cost structure
    in order to better align expenses with revenue expectations,
    which included a workforce reduction of approximately five
    percent worldwide. Once



the reductions are fully implemented, the plan is expected to
    save approximately $200 million in costs on an annualized
    basis.

•

We completed two small acquisitions during fiscal 2007,
    Company-i Limited and 4FrontSecurity, Inc. In addition, in a
    more significant transaction announced during fiscal 2007, and
    completed in April 2007, we acquired Altiris, Inc., a leading
    provider of IT management software. We believe this acquisition
    will enable us to help customers better manage and enforce
    security policies at the endpoint, identify and protect against
    threats, and repair and service their IT assets.

•

We expanded our operations in India and China as we look to
    broaden our access to engineering talent, primarily in product
    support and development, on a worldwide basis. This has
    increased the efficiency of our support and development
    activities.

•

We repurchased 162 million shares of our common stock for
    an aggregate amount of $2.8 billion.

Founded in 1982, Symantec has grown to approximately
    $5.2 billion in revenue in fiscal 2007, positioning
    Symantec as the fourth largest independent software company in
    the world based on revenue. We have operations in 40 countries
    and our principal executive offices are located at 20330 Stevens
    Creek Blvd, Cupertino, California 95014. Our telephone number at
    that location is

(408) 517-8000.

Other
    than the information expressly set forth in this annual report,
    the information contained, or referred to, on our website is not
    part of this annual report.

Industry

The security market consists of endpoint security; the
    protection and compliance of end-user devices such as desktop
    computers, laptops, and handhelds; data and messaging security;
    network security; and security services. Over the past several
    years, we have seen security threats continue to evolve from
    traditional viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other
    vulnerabilities, and more recently from threats such as phishing
    (attacks that use spoofed websites and emails designed to record
    keystrokes or to fool recipients into divulging personal
    financial data), email fraud, and identity theft. We have also
    seen security rise to a top priority for enterprises as
    information security is increasingly linked to regulatory
    compliance. This evolution is a key driver of our research and
    development and acquisition strategies, as we strive to
    differentiate our solutions from the competition and address our
    customers’ changing needs.

As a result of our acquisition of Veritas in July 2005, we are
    now the leading supplier of hardware-independent storage
    software. The worldwide storage software market consists of
    storage management, server and application management, backup
    and archiving, and infrastructure software products and
    services. Key drivers of demand in this market include the
    ever-increasing quantity of data being collected, the need for
    data to be protected, recoverable, and accessible at all times,
    and the need for a growing number of critical applications to be
    continuously available and highly performing.

Other factors driving demand in this market include the increase
    in the number of Internet users, computing devices, companies
    conducting business online, the continuous automation of
    business processes, the on-going desire of organizations to
    manage their overall IT risk, the increasing pressure on
    companies to lower storage and server management costs while
    simultaneously increasing the utilization, availability levels,
    and performance of their existing IT infrastructure, and the
    increasing importance of document retention and regulatory
    compliance solutions.

    geographical area, and long-lived assets by geographical area,
    see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements. For information regarding the amount and percentage
    of our revenue contributed in each of our product categories and
    our financial information, including information about
    geographic areas in which we operate, see Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of

Operations and Note 15 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For information
    regarding risks associated with our international operations,
    see Item 1A,

Risk Factors.



Operating
    Segments and Products

Our operating segments are significant strategic business units
    that offer different products and services, distinguished by
    customer needs. During fiscal 2007, we operated in five
    operating segments: Consumer Products, Security and Data
    Management, Data Center Management, Services, and Other. The
    Other segment is comprised of sunset products and products
    nearing the end of their life cycle and also includes general
    and administrative expenses; amortization of acquired product
    rights, other intangible assets, and other assets; charges, such
    as acquired in-process research and development, patent
    settlement, stock-based compensation, and restructuring; and
    certain indirect costs that are not charged to the other
    operating segments.

During the June 2007 quarter, we will add an additional segment
    which will consist of the Altiris products. We will also move
    our
    Ghost

tm

,
    pcAnywhere

tm

,
    and
    LiveState

tm

Delivery products from the Security and Data Management segment
    to the Altiris segment. In addition, we will move our Managed
    Security Services, DeepSight, and Software-As-A-Service products
    and services from the Security and Data Management segment to
    the Services segment.

Consumer
    Products

Our Consumer Products segment focuses on delivering our Internet
    security, PC tuneup, and backup products to individual users and
    home offices. Our
    Norton

tm

brand of consumer security software products provides protection
    for
    Windows

®

and
    Macintosh

®

platforms. More than 95 percent of our sales within the
    Consumer Products segment consist of products providing
    protection from malicious attacks.

During fiscal 2007, the growth in our consumer business was
    driven in part by the evolving threat landscape, including
    malicious threats and crimeware, and increased demand for
    products that secure sensitive online consumer interactions,
    such as financial transactions, and in part by the shift to
    recognizing consumer revenue on a ratable basis.

Many of Symantec’s consumer products include an ongoing
    commitment to provide product technology and feature updates
    throughout the typical

12-month

term of the subscription, to help ensure

up-to-the-minute

protection against the latest threats. Most of the products that
    we are currently marketing or developing feature
    LiveUpdate

tm

functionality, which automatically updates these products with
    the latest technology, virus definitions, firewall rules,
    Uniform Resource Locator, or URL, databases, and uninstall
    scripts.

Our primary consumer products are:

Norton Internet Security

This PC and transaction security
    suite helps defend home and home office users against the latest
    online threats by blocking online identity theft, detecting and
    eliminating spyware, removing viruses and worms, and protecting
    against hackers from entering a user’s system. The 2007
    solution delivers essential protection — antivirus,
    antispyware, antiphishing, two-way firewall, rootkit detection,
    and intrusion prevention — as well as significantly
    improved performance. Customers can also receive antispam and
    parental controls through an optional add-on pack.

Norton
    AntiVirus

tm

This product safeguards against
    viruses, spyware, and other security risks. The 2007 version
    optimizes performance while providing enhanced Internet worm
    protection that blocks attacks from entire worm and virus
    families without requiring individual virus and worm signatures;
    enhanced kernel level rootkit protection, which protects against
    known and emerging hidden threats located at the deepest level
    of the operating system; enhanced pre-install scan to help
    ensure a successful installation process; and cookie tracking
    support, which provides customers with the ability to remove
    tracking items known as “cookies.”

Norton 360

This new,

all-in-one

comprehensive security service for mainstream computer users,
    introduced in February 2007, delivers protection across four
    categories: PC security, transaction security, online backup and
    restore, and PC tuneup. It also includes embedded support.
    Customers can also receive antispam and parental controls
    through an optional add-on pack.



For most of our consumer products, we translate the
    documentation, software, and packaging into the local language
    and prepare marketing programs tailored for each local market.

Security
    and Data Management

Our Security and Data Management segment focuses on providing
    large to small and medium-sized businesses with solutions for
    compliance and security management, endpoint security, messaging
    management, and data protection management software solutions
    that allow our customers to secure, provision, backup, and
    remotely access their laptops, PCs, mobile devices, and servers.
    Our comprehensive solutions include virus protection and content
    filtering, antispam, endpoint security, firewall and virtual
    private networking, or VPN, intrusion protection, policy
    compliance, security management, managed security services, and
    early warning services. At the gateway level, our products run
    on
    Windows NT

®

,
    Solaris

tm

,
    and
    Linux

®

platforms. At the server level, our products operate on
    Windows NT,
    UNIX

®

,
    Linux, and other key server platforms. At the client level, our
    products run on the Windows platform.

During fiscal 2007, our enterprise antivirus and backup products
    continued to experience increased competition as negotiations
    for new and renewal business were aggressive.

Our primary enterprise security solutions address the following
    areas:

Endpoint
    Security

Our security solutions enable organizations to evaluate,
    protect, and remediate both managed and unmanaged systems as
    they connect to corporate assets. Integrated solutions, such as
    Symantec
    AntiVirus

tm

and Symantec Client Security, include antivirus, anti-spyware,
    firewall, intrusion prevention, and network access control
    technologies. Client machines, servers, and mobile devices are
    all protected by Symantec’s technologies.

Data
    Protection and Systems Management

Through solutions such as Backup Exec, pcAnywhere, and Ghost,
    Symantec enables customers to manage their computing systems and
    devices, including backup, recovery, deployment, migration, data
    archiving, and help-desk remote control.

Enterprise
    Messaging Management

Our Enterprise Messaging Solutions provide a common framework
    for customers to consistently enforce content control policies
    across the enterprise, from email and instant messaging security
    to archiving. These solutions are built on market-leading
    antispam, content filtering, policy management, and archiving
    and retention technologies, allowing IT professionals to
    proactively prevent the risks of data leakage and policy
    violations while rapidly and cost-effectively responding to

e-Discovery

requests. Products include Symantec Information
    Foundation

tm

2007, Symantec Mail Security, and Symantec Enterprise
    Vault

tm

.

Compliance
    and Security Management

We provide solutions to help customers define, control, and
    govern their IT policies from a central location. These
    solutions help organizations protect critical assets and reduce
    business risk by probing for network vulnerabilities, monitoring
    threats in real-time, retaining logs for analysis, managing
    security incidents, and demonstrating compliance with internal
    mandates and external regulations. Our solutions include
    Symantec Control Compliance Suite, Symantec
    BindView

tm

Policy Manager, Symantec Security Information Manager, and
    Symantec Enterprise Security Manager.

Managed
    Security Services

Symantec Managed Security Services are designed to allow
    enterprise IT organizations to cost-effectively outsource their
    security management, monitoring, and response needs. Our
    comprehensive service offerings leverage the knowledge of
    Internet security experts to protect the value of an
    organization’s networked assets and infrastructure. We
    provide remote monitoring and management of vendor neutral
    firewall and VPN solutions; real-



time monitoring and analysis of intrusion detection alerts;
    coordinated event monitoring, analysis, and management of
    Symantec security appliances; and integrated global intelligence
    services from our early warning solutions. Symantec Managed
    Security Services uses global intelligence to offer fast and
    accurate analysis of security data to protect customers against
    emerging threats and reduce overall security risk.

Threat
    and Early Warning Systems

Our customized and comprehensive alerts of impending
    Internet-based attacks worldwide — with
    countermeasures to prevent attacks before they occur —
    enable companies to mitigate risk, manage threats, and help
    ensure business continuity.

Data
    Center Management

Our Data Center Management segment focuses on providing
    enterprise and large enterprise customers with storage and
    server management, data protection, and application performance
    management solutions across heterogeneous storage and server
    platforms. These solutions enable companies to standardize on a
    single layer of infrastructure software that works on every
    major distributed operating system and supports every major
    storage device, database, and application.

Our primary data center management solutions address the
    following areas:

Storage
    Management

These solutions provide storage management, storage resource
    management, storage utilization management, Storage Area
    Network, or SAN, management, storage virtualization and
    replication solutions. Storage Foundation 5.0, announced in May
    2006, provides IT organizations with visibility and control of
    storage assets in their heterogeneous data centers with recent
    enhancements including centralized management and enhanced
    storage virtualization, and includes Storage Foundation Basic
    designed for edge-tier workloads. Veritas Command
    Central

tm

Storage, a storage resource management and SAN management
    solution, enables administrators to gain visibility into all the
    physical devices on their SAN, and provide capacity and
    utilization management and reporting.

Server
    Management

These solutions allow enterprises to ensure the availability of
    critical applications, and to understand and manage their server
    and application infrastructure in a more effective and automated
    fashion. Veritas Cluster Server allows critical applications to
    remain operational, even when the underlying physical servers
    running those applications experience outages. Through solutions
    such as Server Foundation, Symantec provides enterprise
    customers the ability to discover in detail what is running on
    all the servers in their data center, and to actively manage and
    administer those servers. The Server Foundation suite of
    products provides application virtualization, patch management,
    configuration management, server provisioning, and server
    management across heterogeneous storage and server platforms and
    virtual machines. In November 2006, we further expanded Server
    Foundation with the addition of Veritas Application Director.
    Application Director helps companies share server resources
    across applications to maximize server utilization and
    application availability.

Data
    Protection

The NetBackup solutions are designed to protect, backup,
    archive, and restore data across a broad range of enterprise
    computing environments — from large corporate data
    centers to remote offices and desktop and laptop computers.
    Veritas NetBackup
    PureDisk

tm

,
    announced in April 2006, combines disk-based data protection and
    advanced data de-duplication technology to enable companies to
    centrally manage and administer data protection for hundreds or
    even thousands of remote offices.

Application
    Performance Management

These products provide monitoring and reporting of performance
    management across business production environments, enabling
    organizations to meet stringent Service Level Agreements
    set for important applications.



The Application Service Dashboard, announced in January 2007,
    allows IT organizations to easily customize Symantec
    i3

tm

performance and service-level metrics via a single dashboard,
    enabling IT staff members to maximize their efficiency in
    supporting today’s multi-tier business applications.

Services

Our Services segment consists of consultants with extensive
    technical knowledge, business expertise, and global insight
    across multi-vendor environments who assist organizations in
    managing IT risk on an ongoing basis. Services addresses the
    primary areas of IT risk — security, availability,
    performance, and compliance. We provide customers with
    maintenance and technical support, consulting, education, and
    business critical services.

The primary classes of consulting service that we offer are:

Symantec Advisory Services

Advisory Services consultants
    combine technical expertise with a business focus to create
    comprehensive plans and strategies. Each area of our expertise
    has a portfolio of defined services and deliverables, as well as
    custom offerings.

Symantec Solutions Enablement

Solutions Enablement consultants
    provide organizations with the expertise to optimize and
    accelerate the benefits of IT infrastructure investments by
    designing, implementing, and rolling out solutions.

Symantec Residency and Operational
    Services

In December 2006, we expanded our
    services to include support for customers’ long-term
    programs. These consultants offer deployment and migration
    assistance and management, support IT staffs, and provide
    continuous

on-site

technology and business expertise.

Sales and
    Channel Strategy

Consumer
    Products

We sell our consumer products to individuals and home offices
    globally through a multi-tiered network of distribution
    partners. Our strategy is to place our products in a variety of
    channels where consumers might consider purchasing security and
    backup products.

Our products are available to customers through channels that
    include distributors, retailers, direct marketers,
    Internet-based resellers, OEMs, system builders, educational
    institutions, and ISPs. We separately sell annual content update
    subscriptions directly to end-users primarily through the
    Internet. We also sell some of our products and product upgrades
    in conjunction with channel partners through direct mail/email
    and over the Internet.

Sales in the Consumer Products business through our electronic
    distribution channel, which includes OEM subscriptions,
    upgrades, online sales, and renewals, grew by $221 million
    in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, nearly
    70 percent of revenue in the Consumer Products segment came
    from our electronic channels. We also made infrastructure
    improvements in order to capture more direct renewal business
    from customers originally reached through these channels.

Enterprise
    Solutions

We sell and market our products and related services to
    enterprise customers both directly and through a variety of
    indirect sales channels, which include value-added resellers, or
    VARs, large account resellers, or LARs, distributors, system
    integrators, or SIs, and OEMs. Our enterprise customers include
    many leading global corporations, small and medium-sized
    businesses, and many government agencies around the world. Many
    of our products involve a consultative, solution-oriented sales
    model. Thus, our sales efforts are targeted to senior executives
    and IT department personnel who are responsible for managing a
    company’s IT initiatives.

Our primary method of demand generation for enterprise customers
    is through our direct sales force. We ended fiscal 2007 with
    approximately 7,800 individuals in our sales and services
    groups. Account managers are responsible for customer
    relationships and opportunity management and are supported by
    product and services



specialists. In the June 2006 quarter, we integrated the
    Symantec and Veritas sales forces and moved to a single account
    manager per major account model in order to provide customers
    with more relationship oriented service.

We complement our direct sales efforts with indirect sales
    channels such as resellers, VARs, LARs, distributors, and SIs,
    primarily to address the small to medium-sized enterprise
    market. We sell our products through authorized distributors in
    more than 40 countries throughout the world. Our top
    distributors are Ingram Micro, Inc. and Tech Data Product
    Management, Inc.

Another important element of our Enterprise Solutions strategy
    involves our relationships with OEM partners that incorporate
    our products into their products, bundle our products with their
    products, or serve as authorized resellers of our products.

Marketing
    and Advertising

Our marketing expenditure is primarily spent on advertising and
    promotion, which includes demand generation and brand
    recognition of our consumer and enterprise products. Our
    advertising and promotion efforts include, but are not limited
    to, electronic and print advertising, trade shows, collateral
    production, and all forms of direct marketing. We also invest in
    cooperative marketing campaigns with distributors, resellers,
    retailers, OEMs, and industry partners.

We continually conduct market research to understand evolving
    customer needs and buying behaviors to identify the latest
    consumer and enterprise trends, as well as overall customer
    satisfaction with our products and services. We also communicate
    with customers through the Symantec website, regularly scheduled
    Web-based seminars and online newsletters, as well as through
    direct mailings, both physical and electronic, to existing
    end-users and prospects.

Other marketing activities include the production of brochures,
    sales tools, multi-media product demonstrations, packaging, and
    other collateral materials. We help drive awareness and
    acquisition through search engine marketing, online content
    syndication, various online and entertainment sponsorships, and

word-of-mouth

marketing, as well as participation in focused trade and
    computer shows, sponsorship of industry analyst conferences, and
    execution of Symantec road shows, seminars, and user group
    conferences. In addition, we invest in various retention
    marketing and customer loyalty programs to help drive renewals
    and encourage customer advocacy and referrals. We also provide
    focused vertical marketing programs in targeted industries and
    countries.

We typically offer two types of rebate programs within most
    countries: volume incentive rebates to channel partners and
    promotional rebates to distributors and end-users. Distributors
    and resellers earn volume incentive rebates primarily based upon
    product sales to end-users. We also offer rebates to individual
    users who purchase products through various resale channels.

We regularly offer upgrade rebates to consumers purchasing a new
    version of a product. Both volume incentive rebates and end-user
    rebates are accrued as an offset to revenue.

Support

We maintain centralized support facilities throughout the world
    that provide rapid,

around-the-clock

responses to complex customer inquiries. We have support
    facilities with experts in technical areas associated with the
    products we produce and the operating environments in which
    these products are deployed by many of our customers. During
    fiscal 2007, we made investments in technology to link our
    global support centers together, which has increased our
    capacity to deliver technical support to our customers
    24 hours a day, seven days a week. Additionally, our
    technology investments improved our ability to deliver online
    solutions to our customers. Our technical support experts
    provide customers with information on product implementation and
    usage, issue resolution, and countermeasures and identification
    tools for new threats. Support is available in multiple
    languages including Cantonese, Dutch, English, French, German,
    Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese, and Spanish. We
    believe that enhanced language support is an important element
    of our success and plan to continue our investments in the
    delivery of non-English technical support.

Our Security Response Team consists of dedicated intrusion
    experts, security engineers, virus hunters, and members of the
    global technical support teams that work in tandem to provide
    extensive coverage for enterprises



and consumers. Symantec Security Response provides customers
    with comprehensive and global Internet security expertise,
    24 hours a day, seven days a week, to guard against
    today’s multi-faceted Internet threats. The Symantec
    Security Response Team issues a semi-annual Internet Security
    Threat report that provides an analysis and discussion of trends
    in Internet attacks, vulnerabilities, malicious code activity,
    and other security risks. We believe that this report is one of
    the most comprehensive sources of Internet threat data in the
    world, identifying emerging trends in attacks and malicious code
    activity. When a new threat or vulnerability is discovered, our
    Security Response experts provide a rapid emergency response
    that consists of communication with customers and delivery of
    security updates for our security products.

Our enterprise security support program offers annual
    maintenance support contracts to enterprise customers worldwide,
    including content, upgrades, and technical support. Our standard
    technical support includes the following:

•

Unlimited hotline service delivered by telephone, fax, email,
    and over the Internet

•

Immediate patches for severe problems

•

Periodic software updates

•

Access to our technical knowledge base and frequently asked
    questions, or FAQ, facility

•

An invitation to our annual user group meeting

Our consumer product support program provides self-help online
    services, chat, and email support to consumer customers
    worldwide. A team of product experts, editors, and language
    translators are dedicated to maintaining the robustness of the
    online knowledge base. Generally, telephone product support is
    provided for a fee by an outside vendor. Customers that
    subscribe to LiveUpdate receive automatic downloads of the
    latest virus definitions, application bug fixes, and patches for
    most of our consumer products.

Customers

Our solutions are used worldwide by individual and enterprise
    customers in a wide variety of industries, small and
    medium-sized enterprises, as well as various governmental
    entities. In fiscal 2007, one distributor, Ingram Micro,
    accounted for more than 10 percent of total net revenues.
    In fiscal 2006 and 2005, two distributors, Ingram Micro and Tech
    Data Product Management, each accounted for more than
    10 percent of our total net revenues. In fiscal 2007, 2006,
    and 2005, one reseller, Digital River, Inc., accounted for more
    than 10 percent of our total net revenues.

Research
    and Development

We believe that technical leadership is essential to our
    success. Therefore, we expect to continue to commit substantial
    resources to research and development. Whether we maintain our
    technical leadership position will largely depend on our ability
    to enhance existing products, respond to changing customer
    requirements, and develop and introduce new products in a timely
    manner.

The Symantec Security Response Team is responsible for a
    significant component of our research and development efforts.
    Our Security Response experts, located at research centers
    throughout the world, are focused on collecting and analyzing
    the latest malware threats, ranging from network security
    threats and vulnerabilities to viruses and worms. To simplify
    and speed up the delivery of security updates for our product
    offerings at the server, gateway, and desktop levels, we use our
    LiveUpdate

tm

technology.

Outside of our Security Response research centers, other major
    research and development initiatives for storage and
    availability products include:

•

Continued focus on operating system platform expansion

•

Development of new infrastructure products, including server
    provisioning, clustering, application performance management,
    and service level management

•

Initiatives to improve replication, storage resource management,
    and next generation virtualization technology



•

Development of new data protection technologies for disk-based
    data protection

•

Continued efforts to ensure regulatory compliance and enhanced
    disaster recovery

Symantec Research Labs, or SRL, is a group designed to foster
    new technologies and products to help us maintain leadership in
    existing markets. A key component of the SRL is our Advanced
    Concepts group, which is focused on identifying new markets and
    quickly transforming ideas into products for those markets.

Independent contractors are used for various aspects of the
    product development process. In addition, elements of some of
    our products are licensed from third parties.

We had research and development expenses, exclusive of
    in-process research and development associated with
    acquisitions, of $867 million in fiscal 2007,
    $682 million in fiscal 2006, and $334 million in
    fiscal 2005. We believe that technical leadership is essential
    to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial
    resources to research and development.

Acquisitions

Our strategic technology acquisitions are designed to enhance
    the features and functionality of our existing products, as well
    as extend our product leadership. We use strategic acquisitions
    to provide certain technology, people, and products for our
    overall product and services strategy. We consider both time to
    market and potential market share gains when evaluating
    acquisitions of technologies, product lines, or companies. We
    have completed a number of acquisitions of technologies,
    companies, and products in the past, and we have also disposed
    of technologies and products. We may acquire

and/or

dispose of other technologies, companies, and products in the
    future.

During fiscal 2007, we completed the following acquisitions:

4FrontSecurity

4FrontSecurity was acquired in
    February 2007 and develops proprietary risk software, assessment
    software, and content-rich assessment tools that improve
    customers’ insight of risk, regulatory, compliance, and
    security control criteria for organizational information and
    business objectives.

Company-i

Company-i is a United
    Kingdom-based professional services firm that we acquired in
    December 2006. The firm specializes in addressing key challenges
    associated with operating and managing a data center in the
    financial services industry. Company-i expands the capability of
    Symantec’s global consulting services group to help clients
    manage IT risk and cost, particularly in the data center.

For further discussion of our acquisitions, see Note 3 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Competition

Our markets are consolidating, are highly competitive, and are
    subject to rapid changes in technology. Our competitiveness
    depends on our ability to deliver products that meet our
    customers’ needs by enhancing our existing solutions and
    services and offering reliable, scalable, and standardized new
    solutions on a timely basis. We believe that the principal
    competitive factors necessary to be successful in our industry
    also include integration of advanced technology, time to market,
    price, reputation, financial stability, breadth of product
    offerings, customer support, brand recognition, and effective
    sales and marketing efforts.

In addition to the competition we face from direct competitors,
    we face indirect or potential competition from application
    providers, operating system providers, network equipment
    manufacturers, and other OEMs, who may provide various solutions
    and functions in their current and future products. We also
    compete for access to retail distribution channels and for the
    attention of customers at the retail level and in corporate
    accounts. In addition, we compete with other software companies,
    operating system providers, network equipment manufacturers and
    other OEMs to acquire technologies, products, or companies and
    to publish software developed by third parties. We also compete
    with other software companies in our effort to place our
    products on the computer equipment sold to consumers by OEMs.



The competitive environments in which each segment operates are
    described below

Consumer
    Products

Some of the channels in which our consumer products are offered
    are highly competitive. Our competitors are sometimes intensely
    focused on customer acquisition, which has led such competitors
    to offer their technology for free, engage in aggressive
    marketing, or enter into competitive partnerships.

Our primary competitors in the Consumer Products segment are
    McAfee, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, and Trend Micro, Inc. There
    are also several smaller regional security companies that we
    compete against primarily in the EMEA and Asia Pacific Japan
    regions. During fiscal 2007, Microsoft launched a security suite
    that competes with our consumer products. This security suite
    includes antispyware and antivirus features, PC tuneup, a
    managed two-way firewall, and a backup utility. In addition,
    Microsoft has recently added security features to new versions
    of its operating system products that provide some of the same
    functions offered in our products.

Security
    and Data Management

In the security and data management markets, we compete against
    many companies that offer competing products to our technology
    solutions and competing services to our response and support
    services. Our primary competitors in the security market are
    McAfee, Trend Micro, Cisco Systems, Inc, and Microsoft. There
    are also several smaller regional security companies that we
    compete against primarily in the EMEA and APJ regions. The
    market for data protection products is characterized by ongoing
    technological innovation. Many of our strategic partners offer
    software products that compete with our products or have
    announced their intention to focus on developing or acquiring
    their own backup, archive, and data restoration software
    products. Our primary competitors in the data protection
    business are International Business Machines Corporation, or
    IBM, CA, Inc., EMC Corporation, CommVault Systems, Inc., and
    Microsoft. In the managed security services business, our
    primary competitors are VeriSign, Inc. and IBM.

Recent security acquisitions and offerings by EMC, IBM and
    Microsoft are indicators of the move into the security market
    which could lead to the release of stand-alone enterprise
    products or to the inclusion of security functionality in future
    versions of the operating system products. With security being a
    required solution for enterprises of all sizes, we believe that
    product differentiation is essential for us to maintain our
    leadership position. We are focused on integrating next
    generation technology capabilities into our solution set in
    order to differentiate ourselves from the competition.

Data
    Center Management

The markets for data center management are intensely
    competitive. In the areas of storage management, application
    management and server management, our primary competitors are
    EMC, IBM, Hewlett-Packard Company, or HP, Sun Microsystems,
    Inc., Oracle Corporation, and Microsoft.

Services

We believe that the principal competitive factors for our
    services segment include technical capability, customer
    responsiveness, and our ability to hire and retain talented and
    experienced services personnel. Our primary competitors in the
    services segment are EMC, HP, IBM, and regional specialized
    consulting firms.

Intellectual
    Property

Protective
    Measures

We regard some of the features of our internal operations,
    software, and documentation as proprietary and rely on
    copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws,
    confidentiality procedures, contractual arrangements, and



other measures to protect our proprietary information. Our
    intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that
    enables us to gain recognition for our products, services, and
    technology and enhance our competitive position.

As part of our confidentiality procedures, we generally enter
    into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, distributors,
    and corporate partners, and we enter into license agreements
    with respect to our software, documentation, and other
    proprietary information. These license agreements are generally
    non-transferable and have a perpetual term. We also educate our
    employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to
    protect our facilities, equipment, and networks.

Trademarks,
    Patents, Copyrights, and Licenses

Symantec and the Symantec logo are trademarks or registered
    trademarks in the U.S. and other countries. In addition to
    Symantec and the Symantec logo, we have used, registered,

and/or

applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks
    to help distinguish our products, technologies, and services
    from those of our competitors in the U.S. and foreign countries
    and jurisdictions. We enforce our trademark, service mark, and
    trade name rights in the U.S. and abroad. The duration of our
    trademark registrations varies from country to country, and in
    the U.S. we generally are able to maintain our trademark
    rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the
    trademarks are in use.

We have a number of U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending
    patent applications, including patents and rights to patent
    applications acquired through strategic transactions, which
    relate to various aspects of our products and technology. The
    duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country
    of issuance and for the U.S. is typically 17 years
    from the date of issuance of the patent or 20 years from
    the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the
    patent, which we believe is adequate relative to the expected
    lives of our products.

Our products are protected under U.S. and international
    copyright laws and laws related to the protection of
    intellectual property and proprietary information. We take
    measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary
    rights notices, and we actively enforce such rights in the U.S.
    and abroad. However, these measures may not provide sufficient
    protection, and our intellectual property rights may be
    challenged. In addition, we license some intellectual property
    from third parties for use in our products, and generally must
    rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual
    property rights. While we believe that our ability to maintain
    and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our
    success, we also believe that our business as a whole is not
    materially dependent on any particular patent, trademark,
    license, or other intellectual property right.

Seasonality

As is typical for many large software companies, our business is
    seasonal. Software license and maintenance orders are generally
    higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our
    first and second fiscal quarters. A significant decline in
    license and maintenance orders is typical in the first quarter
    of our fiscal year as compared to license and maintenance orders
    in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. In addition, we
    generally receive a higher volume of software license and
    maintenance orders in the last month of a quarter, with orders
    concentrated in the later part of that month. We believe that
    this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns
    and budget cycles, as well as the impact of compensation
    incentive plans for our sales personnel. Revenue generally
    reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than
    orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is
    shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition
    criteria are met.

Employees

As of March 31, 2007, we employed approximately
    17,100 people worldwide, approximately 54 percent of
    whom reside in the U.S. Approximately 6,000 employees work
    in sales, marketing, and related activities; 5,000 in product
    development; 3,600 in support and services; and 2,500 in
    management, manufacturing, and administration.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

A description of the risk factors associated with our business
    is set forth below. The list is not exhaustive and you should
    carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before
    investing in our common stock.

If we
    are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services
    that achieve widespread market acceptance, or if we are unable
    to continually improve the performance, features, and
    reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our
    business model to keep pace with industry trends, our business
    and operating results could be adversely affected.

Our future success depends on our ability to respond to the
    rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or
    introducing new products, product upgrades, and services on a
    timely basis. We have in the past incurred, and will continue to
    incur, significant research and development expenses as we
    strive to remain competitive. New product development and
    introduction involves a significant commitment of time and
    resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges
    including:

•

Managing the length of the development cycle for new products
    and product enhancements, which has frequently been longer than
    we originally expected

•

Adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to
    technological developments by our competitors and customers

•

Extending the operation of our products and services to new
    platforms and operating systems

•

Entering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited
    experience

•

Managing new product and service strategies, including
    integrating our various security and storage technologies,
    management solutions, customer service, and support into unified
    enterprise security and storage solutions

•

Incorporating acquired products and technologies

•

Trade compliance issues affecting our ability to ship new
    products

•

Developing or expanding efficient sales channels

•

Obtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access
    from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to
    enable the development and deployment of interoperable products,
    including source code licenses for certain products with deep
    technical integration into operating systems

In addition, if we cannot adapt our business models to keep pace
    with industry trends, our revenue could be negatively impacted.
    In connection with our enterprise software offerings, we license
    our applications on a variety of bases, such as per server, per
    processor, or based on performance criteria such as per amount
    of data processed or stored. If enterprises migrate towards
    solutions, such as virtualization, which allow enterprises to
    run multiple applications and operating systems on a single
    server and thereby reduce the number of servers they are
    required to own and operate, we may experience lower license
    revenues unless we are able to successfully change our
    enterprise licensing model to take into account the impact of
    these new solutions.



If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges,
    or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not
    technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance,
    our business and operating results could be adversely affected.

Fluctuations
    in demand for our products and services are driven by many
    factors, and a decrease in demand for our products could
    adversely affect our financial results.

We are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and
    services due to a variety of factors, including competition,
    product obsolescence, technological change, budget constraints
    of our actual and potential customers, levels of broadband
    usage, awareness of security threats to IT systems, and other
    factors. While such factors may, in some periods, increase
    product sales, fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact
    our product sales. As attention to security threats fluctuates,
    the growth rates in sales of security products have been
    impacted, particularly in our Consumer Products segment. If
    demand for our products declines, our revenues and gross margin
    could be adversely affected.

We
    operate in a highly competitive environment, and our competitors
    may gain market share in the markets for our products that could
    adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to
    decline.

We operate in intensely competitive markets that experience
    rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards,
    changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product
    introductions and improvements. If we are unable to anticipate
    or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new
    competitors gain market share in any of our markets, our
    competitive position could weaken and we could experience a drop
    in revenues that could adversely affect our business and
    operating results. To compete successfully, we must maintain a
    successful research and development effort to develop new
    products and services and enhance existing products and
    services, effectively adapt to changes in the technology or
    product rights held by our competitors, appropriately respond to
    competitive strategy, and effectively adapt to technological
    changes and changes in the ways that our information is
    accessed, used, and stored within our enterprise and consumer
    markets. If we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors
    or to changing technological and customer demands, we could
    experience a negative effect on our competitive position and our
    financial results.

Our traditional competitors include independent software vendors
    that offer software products that directly compete with our
    product offerings. In addition to competing with these vendors
    directly for sales to end-users of our products, we compete with
    them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the
    product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer
    hardware OEMs and ISPs. Our competitors could gain market share
    from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products
    with the products of our competitors or if they more actively
    promote our competitors’ products than our products. In
    addition, software vendors who have bundled our products with
    theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or
    other vendors’ software or may limit our access to standard
    product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products
    for their platform.

We face growing competition from network equipment and computer
    hardware manufacturers and large operating system providers.
    These firms are increasingly developing and incorporating into
    their products data protection and storage and server management
    software that competes at some levels with our product
    offerings. Our competitive position could be adversely affected
    to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality
    incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our
    products. Microsoft has added remote access features to its
    operating systems and has made announcements of actual and
    anticipated product features and new product offerings that
    compete with a number of our product offerings. In addition, we
    believe that Microsoft has recently made changes to its
    operating systems that make it more difficult for independent
    security vendors to provide solutions for their customers. We
    could be adversely affected if customers, particularly
    consumers, perceive that features incorporated into the
    Microsoft operating system reduce the need for our products or
    if they prefer to purchase other Microsoft products that are
    bundled with its operating systems and compete with our products.

Another growing industry trend is the software-as-a-service
    (SaaS) business model, whereby software vendors develop and host
    their applications for use by customers over the Internet. This
    allows enterprises to obtain the benefits of commercially
    licensed, internally operated software without the associated
    complexity or high initial

set-up

and
    operational costs. Advances in the SaaS business model could
    enable the growth of our competitors and



could affect the success of our traditional software licensing
    models. We have recently released our own SaaS offerings;
    however, it is uncertain whether our SaaS strategy will prove
    successful or whether we will be able to successfully
    incorporate our SaaS offering into our current licensing models.
    Our inability to successfully develop and market SaaS product
    offerings could cause us to lose business to competitors.

Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical,
    sales, marketing, or other resources than we do and consequently
    may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their
    products instead of ours. We also face competition from many
    smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the
    markets in which we compete.

If we
    fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively
    or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to
    their customers, our operating results could be adversely
    affected.

We sell our products to customers around the world through
    multi-tiered sales and distribution networks. Sales through
    these different channels involve distinct risks, including the
    following:

Direct Sales.

A significant portion of our
    revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our
    direct sales force to end-users. Special risks associated with
    this sales channel include:

•

Longer sales cycles associated with direct sales efforts

•

Difficulty in hiring, retaining, and motivating our direct sales
    force

•

Substantial amounts of training for sales representatives to
    become productive, including regular updates to cover new and
    revised products

Indirect Sales Channels.

A significant portion
    of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels,
    including distributors that sell our products to end-users and
    other resellers. This channel involves a number of risks,
    including:

•

Our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products
    to end-users

•

Our resellers and distributors are not subject to minimum sales
    requirements or any obligation to market our products to their
    customers

•

Our reseller and distributor agreements are generally
    nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause

•

Our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute
    competing products and may, from time to time, place greater
    emphasis on the sale of these products due to pricing,
    promotions, and other terms offered by our competitors

OEM Sales Channels.

A significant portion of
    our revenues is derived from sales through our OEM partners that
    incorporate our products into, or bundle our products with,
    their products. Our reliance on this sales channel involves many
    risks, including:

•

Our lack of control over the shipping dates or volume of systems
    shipped

•

Our OEM partners are generally not subject to minimum sales
    requirements or any obligation to market our products to their
    customers

•

Our OEM partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements
    with us and new terms may be less favorable due, among other
    things, to an increasingly competitive relationship with certain
    partners

•

Sales through our OEM partners are subject to changes in
    strategic direction, competitive risks, and other issues that
    could result in reduction of OEM sales

•

The development work that we must generally undertake under our
    agreements with our OEM partners may require us to invest
    significant resources and incur significant costs with little or
    no associated revenues

•

The time and expense required for the sales and marketing
    organizations of our OEM partners to become familiar with our
    products may make it more difficult to introduce those products
    to the market



•

Our OEM partners may develop, market, and distribute their own
    products and market and distribute products of our competitors,
    which could reduce our sales

If we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels
    successfully, these channels may conflict with one another or
    otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate, which could reduce
    our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our
    competitive position. Some of our distribution partners have
    experienced financial difficulties in the past, and if our
    partners suffer financial difficulties in the future, we may
    have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could
    adversely affect our operating results. In addition, reliance on
    multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause
    unpredictability in demand, which could increase the risk that
    we may be unable to plan effectively for the future, and could
    result in adverse operating results in future periods.

We
    have grown, and may continue to grow, through acquisitions that
    give rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect
    our future financial results.

We have in the past acquired, and we expect to acquire in the
    future, other businesses, business units, and technologies.
    Acquisitions can involve a number of special risks and
    challenges, including:

•

Complexity, time, and costs associated with the integration of
    acquired business operations, workforce, products, and
    technologies into our existing business, sales force, employee
    base, product lines, and technology

•

Diversion of management time and attention from our existing
    business and other business opportunities

•

Loss or termination of employees, including costs associated
    with the termination or replacement of those employees

•

Assumption of debt or other liabilities of the acquired
    business, including litigation related to the acquired business

•

The incurrence of additional acquisition-related debt as well as
    increased expenses and working capital requirements

•

Dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders

•

Increased costs and efforts in connection with compliance with
    Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

•

Substantial accounting charges for restructuring and related
    expenses, write-off of in-process research and development,
    impairment of goodwill, amortization of intangible assets, and
    stock-based compensation expense

Integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be
    a complex, time consuming, and expensive process, and can impact
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting. For example, as disclosed in Item 9A in this
    annual report, we have remediated a material weakness in our
    internal control over financial reporting that was largely
    related to Symantec having insufficient personnel resources with
    adequate expertise to properly manage the increased volume and
    complexity of income tax matters arising from the acquisition of
    Veritas.

If integration of our acquired businesses is not successful, we
    may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or
    undergo other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee.
    To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our
    technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and
    manage the personnel of the acquired operations. We also must
    effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired
    business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various
    interests, and may need to enter new markets in which we have no
    or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have
    stronger market positions.

Any of the foregoing, and other factors, could harm our ability
    to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired
    businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of
    acquisitions. In addition, because acquisitions of high
    technology companies are inherently risky, no assurance can be
    given that our previous or future acquisitions will be
    successful and will not adversely affect our business, operating
    results, or financial condition.



We
    have not historically maintained substantial levels of
    indebtedness, and our financial condition and results of
    operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively
    manage our liabilities.

In June 2006, we sold $2.1 billion in aggregate principal
    amount of convertible senior notes. As a result of the sale of
    the notes, we have a substantially greater amount of long term
    debt than we have maintained in the past. In addition, we have
    entered into a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of
    $1 billion. Our credit facility allows us immediate access
    to domestic funds if we identify opportunities for its use. We
    may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our
    maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect
    our flexibility to take advantage of certain corporate
    opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition
    and results of operations.

Our
    international operations involve risks that could increase our
    expenses, adversely affect our operating results, and require
    increased time and attention of our management.

We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers
    located outside of the U.S. and we have significant operations
    outside of the U.S., including engineering, sales, customer
    support, and production. We plan to expand our international
    operations, but such expansion is contingent upon the financial
    performance of our existing international operations as well as
    our identification of growth opportunities. Our international
    operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by
    our domestic operations, including:

•

Potential loss of proprietary information due to
    misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our
    intellectual property rights than U.S. laws

•

Requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls,
    including trade and labor restrictions and related laws that
    reduce the flexibility of our business operations

•

Regulations or restrictions on the use, import, or export of
    encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the
    acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks
    for secure communications

•

Central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate
    cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in
    international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the
    U.S.

•

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability
    such as higher interest rates in the U.S. and inflation that
    could reduce our customers’ ability to obtain financing for
    software products or that could make our products more expensive
    or could increase our costs of doing business in certain
    countries

•

Limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current
    levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest
    sufficiently in our international operations

•

Longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and
    difficulties in collecting accounts receivable

•

Difficulties in staffing, managing, and operating our
    international operations, including difficulties related to
    administering our stock plans in some foreign countries

•

Difficulties in coordinating the activities of our
    geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations

•

Seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in
    Europe and in other periods in other countries

•

Reduced sales due to the failure to obtain any required export
    approval of our technologies, particularly our encryption
    technologies

•

Costs and delays associated with developing software in multiple
    languages

•

Political unrest, war, or terrorism, particularly in areas in
    which we have facilities

A significant portion of our transactions outside of the
    U.S. are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly,
    our future operating results will continue to be subject to
    fluctuations in foreign currency rates. We may be negatively
    affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the
    future, especially if international sales continue to grow as a
    percentage of our total sales.



The level of corporate tax from sales to our

non-U.S. customers

is less than the level of tax from sales to our
    U.S. customers. This benefit is contingent upon existing
    tax regulations in the U.S. and in the countries in which our
    international operations are located. Future changes in domestic
    or international tax regulations could adversely affect our
    ability to continue to realize these tax benefits.

Our
    products are complex and operate in a wide variety of computer
    configurations, which could result in errors or product
    failures.

Because we offer very complex products, undetected errors,
    failures, or bugs may occur, especially when products are first
    introduced or when new versions are released. Our products are
    often installed and used in large-scale computing environments
    with different operating systems, system management software,
    and equipment and networking configurations, which may cause
    errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected
    errors, failures, or bugs in our products. Our customers’
    computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety
    of standard and non-standard configurations that make
    pre-release testing for programming or compatibility errors very
    difficult and time-consuming. In addition, despite testing by us
    and others, errors, failures, or bugs may not be found in new
    products or releases until after commencement of commercial
    shipments. In the past, we have discovered software errors,
    failures, and bugs in certain of our product offerings after
    their introduction and, in some cases, may have experienced
    delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errors.

Errors, failures, or bugs in products released by us could
    result in negative publicity, product returns, loss of or delay
    in market acceptance of our products, loss of competitive
    position, or claims by customers or others. Many of our end-user
    customers use our products in applications that are critical to
    their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects
    in our products than to defects in other, less critical,
    software products. In addition, if an actual or perceived breach
    of information integrity or availability occurs in one of our
    end-user customer’s systems, regardless of whether the
    breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of
    the effectiveness of our products could be harmed. Alleviating
    any of these problems could require significant expenditures of
    our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions,
    delays, or cessation of our product licensing, which could cause
    us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely
    affect our operating results.

If we
    are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, lose key
    personnel, fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully,
    or fail to manage our employee base effectively, we may be
    unable to develop new and enhanced products and services,
    effectively manage or expand our business, or increase our
    revenues.

Our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and
    retain our key management, technical, sales, marketing, finance,
    and other critical personnel. Our officers and other key
    personnel are

employees-at-will,

and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them.
    Competition for people with the specific skills that we require
    is significant. In order to attract and retain personnel in a
    competitive marketplace, we believe that we must provide a
    competitive compensation package, including cash and
    equity-based compensation. The volatility in our stock price may
    from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or
    retain employees. In addition, we may be unable to obtain
    required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number
    of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation
    plans, and recent changes in accounting rules require us to
    treat the issuance of employee stock options and other forms of
    equity-based compensation as compensation expense. As a result,
    we may decide to issue fewer equity-based incentives and may be
    impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary
    personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified
    employees, or conversely, if we fail to manage employee
    performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market
    conditions, our business and operating results could be
    adversely affected.

Key personnel have left our company in the past and there likely
    will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time
    in the future. The loss of any key employee could result in
    significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely
    affecting the timeliness of product releases, the successful
    implementation and completion of company initiatives, the
    effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our
    internal control over financial reporting, and the results of
    our operations. In addition, hiring, training, and successfully
    integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time
    consuming, may cause additional disruptions to our operations,
    and may be unsuccessful, which could negatively impact future
    revenues.



We are
    a party to several class action lawsuits, which could require
    significant management time and attention and result in
    significant legal expenses, and which could, if not determined
    favorably, negatively impact our business, financial condition,
    results of operations, and cash flows.

We have been named as a party to class action lawsuits, and we
    may be named in additional litigation. The expense of defending
    such litigation may be costly and divert management’s
    attention from the

day-to-day

operations of our business, which could adversely affect our
    business, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, an
    unfavorable outcome in such litigation could negatively impact
    our business, results of operations, and cash flows.

Third
    parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could
    cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from
    selling our products.

From time to time, we receive claims that we have infringed the
    intellectual property rights of others, including claims
    regarding patents, copyrights, and trademarks. In addition,
    former employers of our former, current, or future employees may
    assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to
    us the confidential or proprietary information of these former
    employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result
    in costly litigation and distract management from

day-to-day

operations. If we are not successful in defending such claims,
    we could be required to stop selling, delay shipments of, or
    redesign our products, pay monetary amounts as damages, enter
    into royalty or licensing arrangements, or satisfy
    indemnification obligations that we have with some of our
    customers.

In addition, we license and use software from third parties in
    our business. These third party software licenses may not
    continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all,
    and may expose us to additional liability. This liability, or
    our inability to use any of this third party software, could
    result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business
    that could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

If we
    do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third
    parties from making unauthorized use of our products and
    technology, our financial results could be harmed.

Most of our software and underlying technology are proprietary.
    We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination
    of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through
    copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws. However,
    all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be
    challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. Third
    parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise
    obtain, use, distribute, and sell our proprietary information
    without authorization. Third parties may also develop similar or
    superior technology independently by designing around our
    patents. Our shrink-wrap license agreements are not signed by
    licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of
    some jurisdictions. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign
    countries do not offer the same level of protection of our
    proprietary rights as the laws of the U.S., and we may be
    subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries.
    The unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary
    information could result in reduced sales of our products. Any
    legal action to protect proprietary information that we may
    bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could
    adversely affect our ability to access software, operating
    system, and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor, or
    cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products
    to their customers. In addition, any legal action to protect
    proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in,
    alone or through our alliances with the Business Software
    Alliance (BSA), or the Software & Information Industry
    Association (SIIA), could be costly, may distract management
    from

day-to-day

operations, and may lead to additional claims against us, which
    could adversely affect our operating results.

Some
    of our products contain “open source” software, and
    any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these
    open source licenses could negatively affect our
    business.

Certain of our products are distributed with software licensed
    by its authors or other third parties under so-called “open
    source” licenses, which may include, by way of example, the
    GNU General Public License (GPL), GNU Lesser General Public
    License (LGPL), the Mozilla Public License, the BSD License, and
    the Apache License. Some of these licenses contain requirements
    that we make available source code for modifications or



derivative works we create based upon the open source software,
    and that we license such modifications or derivative works under
    the terms of a particular open source license or other license
    granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we
    combine our proprietary software with open source software in a
    certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source
    licenses, be required to release the source code of our
    proprietary software. In addition to risks related to license
    requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater
    risks than use of third party commercial software, as open
    source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls
    on origin of the software. We have established processes to help
    alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening
    requests from our development organizations for the use of open
    source, but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted
    for approval prior to use in our products. In addition, many of
    the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be
    eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively
    affect our business.

Our
    software products and website may be subject to intentional
    disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future
    sales.

Although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to
    prevent intentional disruptions, we expect to be an ongoing
    target of attacks specifically designed to impede the
    performance of our products. Similarly, experienced computer
    programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the
    security of our website and misappropriate proprietary
    information or cause interruptions of our services. Because the
    techniques used by such computer programmers to access or
    sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized
    until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate
    these techniques. Our activities could be adversely affected and
    our reputation and future sales harmed if these intentionally
    disruptive efforts are successful.

Increased
    customer demands on our technical support services may adversely
    affect our relationships with our customers and our financial
    results.

We offer technical support services with many of our products.
    We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate
    short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We
    also may be unable to modify the format of our support services
    to compete with changes in support services provided by
    competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers.
    Further customer demand for these services, without
    corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely
    affect our operating results.

We have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide
    consumer support functions to third party service providers. If
    these companies experience financial difficulties, do not
    maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy
    our contracts, or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient
    level under these contracts, the level of support services to
    our customers may be significantly disrupted, which could
    materially harm our relationships with these customers.

Accounting
    charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial
    results.

Our financial results have been in the past, and may continue to
    be in the future, materially affected by non-cash and other
    accounting charges, including:

•

Amortization of intangible assets, including acquired product
    rights

•

Impairment of goodwill

•

Stock-based compensation expense

•

Restructuring charges

•

Impairment of long-lived assets

For example, in connection with our acquisition of Veritas, we
    have recorded approximately $2.8 billion of acquired
    product rights and other intangible assets and $8.6 billion
    of goodwill. We have recorded and will continue to record future
    amortization charges with respect to a portion of these
    intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense related
    to the stock options to purchase Veritas common stock assumed by
    us. In addition, we will evaluate our long-lived assets,
    including property and equipment, goodwill, acquired product
    rights, and other intangible assets, whenever events or
    circumstances occur which indicate that these assets might be
    impaired.



Goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment in the fourth
    quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events and
    circumstances warrant, and our evaluation depends to a large
    degree on estimates and assumptions made by our management. Our
    assessment of any impairment of goodwill is based on a
    comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units to
    the carrying value of that reporting unit. Our determination of
    fair value relies on management’s assumptions of our future
    revenues, operating costs, and other relevant factors. If
    management’s estimates of future operating results change,
    or if there are changes to other assumptions such as the
    discount rate applied to future operating results, the estimate
    of the fair value of our reporting units could change
    significantly, which could result in a goodwill impairment
    charge.

The foregoing types of accounting charges may also be incurred
    in connection with or as a result of other business
    acquisitions. The price of our common stock could decline to the
    extent that our financial results are materially affected by the
    foregoing accounting charges.

Our
    effective tax rate may increase, which could increase our income
    tax expense and reduce our net income.

Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several
    factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:

•

Changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income
    before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate
    that have differing statutory tax rates

•

Changing tax laws, regulations, and interpretations in multiple
    jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the requirements of
    certain tax rulings

•

The tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and
    restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between
    reporting periods

•

Tax assessments, or any related tax interest or penalties, could
    significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in
    which the settlements take place.

The price of our common stock could decline if our financial
    results are materially affected by an adverse change in our
    effective tax rate.

We report our results of operations based on our determinations
    of the amount of taxes owed in the various tax jurisdictions in
    which we operate. From time to time, we receive notices that a
    tax authority to which we are subject has determined that we owe
    a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority,
    and we are regularly engaged in discussions, and sometimes
    disputes, with these tax authorities. We are engaged in disputes
    of this nature at this time. If the ultimate determination of
    our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in
    excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for,
    our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could
    be adversely affected.

Fluctuations
    in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of
    our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in
    the future.

Our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and
    are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number
    of factors, many of which are outside of our control and which
    could adversely affect our operations and operating results. If
    our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future
    financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities
    analysts and investors, our stock price could be negatively
    affected. Any volatility in our quarterly financial results may
    make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or
    pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock. Our
    operating results for prior periods may not be effective
    predictors of our future performance.

Factors associated with our industry, the operation of our
    business, and the markets for our products may cause our
    quarterly financial results to fluctuate, including:

•

Reduced demand for any of our products

•

Entry of new competition into our markets



•

Competitive pricing pressure for one or more of our classes of
    products

•

Our ability to timely complete the release of new or enhanced
    versions of our products

•

The number, severity, and timing of threat outbreaks (e.g. worms
    and viruses)

•

Our resellers making a substantial portion of their purchases
    near the end of each quarter

•

Enterprise customers’ tendency to negotiate site licenses
    near the end of each quarter

•

Cancellation, deferral, or limitation of orders by customers

•

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

•

Movement in interest rates

•

The rate of adoption of new product technologies and new
    releases of operating systems

•

Weakness or uncertainty in general economic or industry
    conditions in any of the multiple markets in which we operate
    that could reduce customer demand and ability to pay for our
    products and services

•

Political and military instability, which could slow spending
    within our target markets, delay sales cycles, and otherwise
    adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and operate
    effectively

•

Budgetary constraints of customers, which are influenced by
    corporate earnings and government budget cycles and spending
    objectives

•

Disruptions in our highly automated business operations caused
    by, among other things,

•

Earthquakes, floods, or other natural disasters affecting our
    headquarters located in Silicon Valley, California, an area
    known for seismic activity, or our other locations worldwide

•

Acts of war or terrorism

•

Intentional disruptions by third parties

Any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of
    our common stock to fluctuate significantly.

Our
    stock price may be volatile in the future, and you could lose
    the value of your investment.

The market price of our common stock has experienced significant
    fluctuations in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the
    future, and as a result you could lose the value of your
    investment. The market price of our common stock may be affected
    by a number of factors, including:

•

Announcements of quarterly operating results and revenue and
    earnings forecasts by us that fail to meet or be consistent with
    our earlier projections or the expectations of our investors or
    securities analysts

•

Announcements by either our competitors or customers that fail
    to meet or be consistent with their earlier projections or the
    expectations of our investors or securities analysts

•

Rumors, announcements, or press articles regarding our or our
    competitors’ operations, management, organization,
    financial condition, or financial statements

•

Changes in revenue and earnings estimates by us, our investors,
    or securities analysts

•

Accounting charges, including charges relating to the impairment
    of goodwill

•

Announcements of planned acquisitions by us or by our competitors

•

Announcements of new or planned products by us, our competitors,
    or our customers

•

Gain or loss of a significant customer

•

Inquiries by the SEC, NASDAQ, law enforcement, or other
    regulatory bodies

•

Acts of terrorism, the threat of war, and other crises or
    emergency situations



•

Economic slowdowns or the perception of an oncoming economic
    slowdown in any of the major markets in which we operate

The stock market in general, and the market prices of stocks of
    technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme
    price volatility that has adversely affected, and may continue
    to adversely affect, the market price of our common stock for
    reasons unrelated to our business or operating results.

Problems
    with our information systems could interfere with our business
    and operations.

We rely on our information systems and those of third parties
    for processing customer orders, shipping of products, providing
    services and support to our customers, billing and tracking our
    customers, fulfilling contractual obligations, and otherwise
    running our business. Any disruption in our information systems
    and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a
    significant impact on our business. In addition, we are in the
    process of enhancing our information systems. The implementation
    of these types of enhancements is frequently disruptive to the
    underlying business of an enterprise, which may especially be
    the case for us due to the size and complexity of our
    businesses. Any disruptions relating to our systems
    enhancements, particularly any disruptions impacting our
    operations during the implementation period, could adversely
    affect our business in a number of respects. Even if we do not
    encounter these adverse effects, the implementation of these
    enhancements may be much more costly than we anticipated. If we
    are unable to successfully implement the information systems
    enhancements as planned, our financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows could be negatively impacted.

Item 1B.

Unresolved
    Staff Comments

There are currently no unresolved issues with respect to any
    Commission staff’s written comments that were received at
    least 180 days before the end of our fiscal year to which
    this report relates and that relate to our periodic or current
    reports under the Exchange Act.

Item 2.

Properties

Our properties consist primarily of owned and leased office
    facilities for sales, research and development, administrative,
    customer service, and technical support personnel. Our Dublin,
    Ireland facility also includes manufacturing operations. Our
    corporate headquarters is located in Cupertino, California in a
    532,000 square foot facility that we own. We occupy an
    additional 772,000 square feet in the San Francisco
    Bay Area, of which 592,000 square feet is owned and
    180,000 square feet is leased. Our leased facilities are
    occupied under leases that expire at various times through 2026.
    The table below shows the approximate square footage of our
    facilities as of March 31, 2007, excluding executive suites.

    third parties.

We also lease additional properties throughout the world,
    totaling approximately 89,000 square feet that are
    currently vacant. We are currently building a facility in Culver
    City, California that we expect to occupy in October 2007.

We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our
    current needs and that the productive capacity of our facilities
    is substantially utilized.



Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

Information with respect to this Item may be found in
    Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    in this annual report which information is incorporated into
    this Item 3 by reference. In addition to the information
    included in Note 14 referred to above, the matter described
    below was resolved during fiscal 2007.

In February 2007, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States
    District Court for the District of Columbia against Veritas
    asserting Securities Act and Exchange Act violations related to
    Veritas’ previously disclosed transactions with AOL Time
    Warner and to matters underlying Veritas’ restatement of
    its financial statements announced in March 2004. At the same
    time, without admitting or denying the allegations in the
    SEC’s complaint, Veritas consented to the entry of a final
    judgment permanently enjoining it from violating
    Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,
    Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the
    Exchange Act, and Exchange Act

rules 10b-5,

12b-20,13a-1,13a-11,

13a-13,

and
    13b2-1 and from aiding and abetting violations of
    Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act

rule 10b-5,

and paid a civil penalty of $30 million.

As of March 31, 2007, there were approximately 4,000
    stockholders of record of Symantec common stock. Symantec has
    never declared or paid any cash dividends on its capital stock.
    We currently intend to retain future earnings for use in our
    business, and, therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash
    dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future.

    program announced in January 2006 as well as the
    $1.5 billion share repurchase program announced in June

    authorized the repurchase of an additional $1 billion of
    Symantec common stock, without a scheduled expiration date.

During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 162 million shares of
    our common stock at prices ranging from $15.61 to
    $21.66 per share for an aggregate amount of
    $2.8 billion. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased
    174 million shares at prices ranging from $15.83 to
    $23.85 per share for an aggregate amount of
    $3.6 billion. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased eight
    million shares at prices ranging from $21.05 to $30.77 per
    share for an aggregate amount of $192 million. As of
    March 31, 2007, $500 million remained authorized for
    future repurchases. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements section for more information.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

OVERVIEW

Our
    Business

Symantec is a global leader in infrastructure software, enabling
    businesses and consumers to have confidence in a connected
    world. We help our customers protect their infrastructure,
    information, and interactions by delivering software and
    services that address risks to information security,
    availability, compliance, and information technology, or IT,
    systems performance. We strive to help our customers manage
    compliance, complexity, and cost by protecting their IT
    infrastructure as they seek to maximize value from their IT
    investments. We deliver a comprehensive and diverse set of
    security and availability products and services to a wide range
    of customers, including large enterprises, governments, small
    and medium-sized businesses, and consumers. Our delivery network
    includes direct, inside, and channel sales resources which
    support our ecosystem of more than 50,000 partners across the
    world, as well as various relationships with original equipment
    manufacturers, or OEMs, Internet service providers, or ISPs, and
    retail and online stores. Founded in 1982, we have operations in
    40 countries.

We have a

52/53-week

fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references as of and
    for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005
    reflect amounts as of and for the periods ended March 30,
    2007, March 31, 2006, and April 1, 2005, respectively,
    each of which consisted of 52 weeks.

Our operating segments are significant strategic business units
    that offer different products and services, distinguished by
    customer needs. In the June 2006 quarter, we consolidated our
    Enterprise Security, Data Protection, and Storage and Server
    Management segments into two segments — the Security
    and Data Management segment and the Data Center Management
    segment. Amounts for the years ended March 31, 2006 and
    2005 have been reclassified to conform to our current
    presentation. As of March 31, 2007, we had five operating
    segments, descriptions of which are provided in Note 15 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

On July 2, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Veritas,
    whereby Veritas became a wholly owned subsidiary of Symantec in
    a transaction accounted for using the purchase method. The
    results of Veritas’ operations have been included in our
    results of operations beginning on July 2, 2005, and have
    had a significant impact on our revenues, cost of revenues, and
    operating expenses since the date of acquisition.

On April 6, 2007, we completed our acquisition of Altiris,
    Inc., a leading provider of IT management software that enables
    businesses to easily manage and service network-based endpoints.
    The aggregate purchase price, excluding acquisition related
    costs, was approximately $815 million in cash, which amount
    was net of Altiris’ cash balance. We believe this
    acquisition will enable us to help customers better manage and
    enforce security policies at the endpoint, identify and protect
    against threats, and repair and service assets. The Altiris
    business will constitute a new business segment in fiscal 2008.
    We will also move our Ghost, pcAnywhere, and LiveState Delivery
    products from the Security and Data Management segment to the
    Altiris segment. In addition, we will move our Managed Security
    Services, DeepSight, and Software-As-A-Service products and
    services from the Security and Data Management segment to the
    Services segment.

Financial
    Results and Trends

Our net income was $404 million for fiscal 2007 as compared
    to $157 million and $536 million for fiscal 2006 and
    2005, respectively. The higher net income for fiscal 2007 as
    compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the write-off in
    fiscal 2006 of $284 million of acquired in-process research
    and development, or IPR&D, as a result of the Veritas
    acquisition for which there is no comparable charge in fiscal
    2007. This increase was partially offset by $154 million of
    stock-based compensation expense related to our adoption of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS,
    No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, effective
    April 1, 2006, higher employee compensation costs resulting
    from increased employee headcount, and $70 million of
    restructuring charges. As of March 31, 2007, employee
    headcount had increased by approximately 8% from March 31,
    2006.

During fiscal 2007, we delivered revenue growth across all of
    our geographic regions as compared to fiscal 2006 and 2005. The
    overall growth is due primarily to the Veritas acquisition,
    which was included in our results for



the full year in fiscal 2007 as compared to only the nine months
    subsequent to the acquisition date of July 2, 2005 in
    fiscal 2006. We believe our revenue growth is also partly
    attributable to increased awareness of Internet-related threats
    around the world and demand for storage solutions. Weakness in
    the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies positively
    impacted our international revenue growth by $105 million
    in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. We are unable to predict
    the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted
    by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If international
    sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future,
    changes in foreign exchange rates may have a potentially greater
    impact on our revenues and operating results.

Although revenue for fiscal 2007 was higher than revenue for
    fiscal 2006 and 2005, certain portions of our business are
    maturing and our rate of revenue growth is slowing for several
    reasons. During fiscal 2007, particularly in the December 2006
    and March 2007 quarters, we provided more flexibility in our
    contract terms and in product deployments and provided more
    services in combination with licenses, we experienced an
    increase in the value of multi-year arrangements compared to
    prior periods, particularly within our Data Center Management
    segment, and we had a large number of maintenance renewals.
    These changes resulted in a greater percentage of revenue being
    deferred and recognized over an extended period of time. In
    addition, in the December 2006 quarter we combined the legacy
    buying programs of Symantec and Veritas into one buying program
    for all of our enterprise offerings, which resulted in a change
    in the vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of pricing
    for our storage and availability offerings. Additional
    information regarding factors that we believe impacted net
    revenue during fiscal 2007 is discussed under “Total Net
    Revenues” below.

In light of the foregoing factors and our slowing rate of
    revenue growth, we implemented a cost savings initiative in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 to better align our expenses with
    our new revenue expectations. The cost savings initiative
    included a workforce reduction of approximately five percent
    worldwide. Once these cost reductions are fully implemented, we
    expect to save approximately $200 million in costs on an
    annualized basis and to have a lower rate of operating expense
    growth than in recent periods. The cost savings initiative
    resulted in a restructuring charge of $51 million in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. We expect that the cost savings
    initiative will result in an additional restructuring charge in
    the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and potentially in other future
    periods.

We expect our gross margins and operating expenses to be
    affected in future periods as a result of recent changes in the
    terms of some of our key OEM relationships. We have negotiated
    new contract terms with some of our OEM partners, which will
    result in payments to OEM partners being included as Operating
    expenses rather than Cost of revenues. In general, payments to
    OEMs made on a placement fee per unit basis will be treated as
    Operating expenses, while payments based on a revenue-sharing
    model will be amortized as Cost of revenues. As a result, we
    expect Cost of revenues to decrease and we expect Operating
    expenses to increase. The increase in Operating expenses will
    more than offset the decrease in Cost of revenues because
    placement fee arrangements are expensed on an estimated average
    cost basis, while revenue-sharing arrangements are amortized
    ratably over a one-year period, and because payments to OEMs
    have increased.

Cash flows were strong in fiscal 2007 as we achieved
    $1.7 billion in operating cash flow. We ended fiscal 2007
    with $3.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
    investments. In addition, during fiscal 2007 we repurchased
    162 million shares of our common stock at prices ranging
    from $15.61 to $21.66 per share for an aggregate amount of
    $2.8 billion.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and
    related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles requires us to make estimates, which include
    judgments and assumptions, that affect the reported amounts of
    assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and related
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based
    our estimates on historical experience and on various
    assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
    circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and
    make changes accordingly. Historically, our critical accounting
    estimates have not differed materially from actual results;
    however, actual results may differ from these estimates under
    different conditions. If actual results differ from these
    estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts
    reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the
    resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our
    Consolidated Statements of Income, and in certain situations,
    could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our
    financial condition.



A critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and
    assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the
    estimate is made. Different estimates that reasonably could have
    been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially
    impact the financial statements. We believe that the estimates
    described below represent our critical accounting estimates, as
    they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated
    financial statements. We also refer you to our

Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies

included in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements in this annual report.

Revenue
    Recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software
    industry. Primarily, we recognize revenue pursuant to the
    requirements of Statement of Position, or

SOP 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition,

, issued by the American
    Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and any applicable
    amendments or modifications. Revenue recognition requirements in
    the software industry are very complex and require us to make
    many estimates.

In arrangements that include multiple elements, including
    perpetual software licenses and maintenance

and/or

services, and packaged products with content updates, we
    allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on
    VSOE of the fair value of the undelivered elements, and
    recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and
    the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. Our
    deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance
    of enterprise product maintenance, consumer product content
    updates, and arrangements where VSOE does not exist. Deferred
    revenue totaled approximately $2.8 billion as of
    March 31, 2007, of which $366 million was presented as
    Long-term deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    VSOE of each element is based on the price for which the
    undelivered element is sold separately. We determine fair value
    of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our
    stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the
    stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements. When VSOE does
    not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance, then the
    entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the
    performance period. Changes to the elements in a software
    arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements,
    the fair value of the respective elements, changes to a
    product’s estimated life cycle, and increasing flexibility
    in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount
    of recognized and deferred revenue.

For our consumer products that include content updates, we
    recognize revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon
    sell through to end-users. Associated cost of revenues is also
    recorded ratably. We record as deferred revenue and inventory
    the respective revenue and cost of revenue amounts of unsold
    product held by our distributors and resellers.

We expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate
    inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer
    demand, which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand
    based on recent buying trends. We ship product to our
    distributors and resellers at their request and based on their
    valid purchase orders. Our distributors and resellers base the
    quantity of their orders on their estimates to meet future
    customer demand, which may exceed our expected level of a four
    or six week supply. We offer limited rights of return if the
    inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the
    expected level of a four or six week supply. We estimate future
    returns under these limited rights of return in accordance with
    SFAS No. 48,

Revenue Recognition When Right of
    Return Exists.

We typically offer liberal rights of return
    if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the
    expected level. Because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount
    of excess inventory that will be returned, we primarily offset
    Deferred revenue against Trade accounts receivable for the
    amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels. If
    we made different estimates, material differences may result in
    the amount and timing of our net revenues and cost of revenues
    for any period presented.

Reserves
    for product returns

We reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue
    based primarily on historical trends. We fully reserve for
    obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to
    deferred revenue. If we made different estimates, material
    differences could result in the amount and timing of our net
    revenues for any period presented. More or less product may be
    returned than what was estimated

and/or

the
    amount of inventory in the channel could



be different than what was estimated. These factors and
    unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment
    could make actual results differ from our return estimates.

Reserves
    for rebates

We estimate and record reserves for channel and end-user rebates
    as an offset to revenue. For consumer products that include
    content updates, rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to
    revenue over the term of the subscription. Our estimated
    reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on
    distributors’ and resellers’ actual performance
    against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate
    programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our
    reserves for end-user rebates are estimated based on the terms
    and conditions of the promotional programs, actual sales during
    the promotion, amount of actual redemptions received, historical
    redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program,
    and the value of the rebate. We also consider current market
    conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for
    rebates. If we made different estimates, material differences
    may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any
    period presented.

Business
    Combinations

When we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to
    tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible
    assets acquired. Any residual purchase price is recorded as
    goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires
    management to make significant estimates in determining the fair
    values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially
    with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based on
    historical experience and information obtained from the
    management of the acquired companies. These estimates can
    include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is
    expected to generate in the future, the appropriate
    weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected
    to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are
    inherently uncertain and unpredictable. In addition,
    unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may
    affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates.

At March 31, 2007, Goodwill was $10.3 billion, Other
    intangible assets, net were $1.2 billion, and Acquired
    product rights, net were $910 million. We assess goodwill
    for impairment within our reporting units annually or more often
    if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value may not be recoverable. We evaluate goodwill for
    impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting
    units, which are the same as our operating segments, to its
    carrying value, including the goodwill allocated to that
    reporting unit. To determine the reporting units’ fair
    value in the current year evaluation, we used the income
    approach under which we calculate the fair value of each
    reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash
    flows of that unit. Our cash flow assumptions are based on
    historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs, and other
    relevant factors. If management’s estimates of future
    operating results change, or if there are changes to other
    assumptions, the estimate of the fair value of our goodwill
    could change significantly. Such change could result in goodwill
    impairment charges in future periods, which could have a
    significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

We assess the impairment of acquired product rights and other
    identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying amount may
    not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when
    the sum of the estimated future cash flows expected to result
    from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less
    than its carrying amount. Such impairment loss would be measured
    as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and
    its fair value. Our cash flow assumptions are based on
    historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs, and other
    relevant factors. If management’s estimates of future
    operating results change, or if there are changes to other
    assumptions, the estimate of the fair value of our acquired
    product rights and other identifiable intangible assets could
    change significantly. Such change could result in impairment
    charges in future periods, which could have a significant impact
    on our consolidated financial statements.

Accounting
    for Excess Facilities

We have estimated expenses for excess facilities related to
    consolidating, moving, and relocating personnel or sites as a
    result of restructuring activities and business acquisitions. In
    determining our estimates, we obtain information from third
    party leasing agents to calculate anticipated third party
    sublease income and the vacancy



period prior to finding a

sub-lessee.

Market conditions may affect our ability to sublease facilities
    on terms consistent with our estimates. Our ability to sublease
    facilities on schedule or to negotiate lease terms resulting in
    higher or lower sublease income than estimated may affect our
    accrual for site closures. In addition, differences between
    estimated and actual related broker commissions, tenant
    improvements, and related exit costs may increase or decrease
    our accrual upon final negotiation. If we made different
    estimates regarding these various components of our excess
    facilities costs, the amount recorded for any period presented
    could vary materially from those actually recorded.

Stock-based
    Compensation

Effective April 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of, and
    accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with,
    SFAS No. 123R. Under SFAS No. 123R, we must
    measure the fair value of all stock-based awards, including
    stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and purchase
    rights under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, on the
    date of grant and amortize the fair value of the award over the
    requisite service period. We elected the modified prospective
    application method, under which prior periods are not revised
    for comparative purposes. The valuation provisions of
    SFAS No. 123R apply to new awards and to awards that
    were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently
    modified. For stock-based awards granted on or after
    April 1, 2006, we recognize stock-based compensation
    expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
    period, which is generally the vesting period. We also recognize
    estimated compensation expense for the unvested portion of
    awards that were outstanding as of the effective date on a
    straight-line basis over the remaining service period using the
    compensation costs estimated for the SFAS No. 123 pro
    forma disclosures.

We currently use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to
    determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of
    the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using
    an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well
    as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective
    variables. These variables include our expected stock price
    volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected
    employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest
    rates, and expected dividends.

We estimate the expected life of options granted based on an
    analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and
    post-vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the
    contractual life of the option. Expected volatility is based on
    the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate
    with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility
    of traded options. The risk free interest rate is equal to the
    U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal
    to the expected life. We do not currently pay cash dividends on
    our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the
    foreseeable future. Accordingly, our expected dividend yield is
    zero. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of
    grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual
    forfeitures differ from those estimates. We estimate forfeitures
    of options, RSUs, and ESPP purchase rights at the time of grant
    based on historical experience and record compensation expense
    only for those awards that are expected to vest. All stock-based
    awards are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite
    service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting
    periods.

If factors change and we employ different assumptions for
    estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods or
    if we decide to use a different valuation model, the amount of
    such expense recorded in future periods may differ significantly
    from what we have recorded in the current period.

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in
    estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
    restrictions and are fully transferable, characteristics not
    present in our option grants. Existing valuation models,
    including the Black-Scholes and lattice binomial models, may not
    provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock-based
    compensation. Consequently, there is a risk that our estimates
    of the fair values of our stock-based compensation awards on the
    grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values
    realized upon the exercise, expiration, early termination, or
    forfeiture of those stock-based payments in the future. Certain
    stock-based payments, such as employee stock options, may expire
    worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as
    compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant
    date and reported in our financial statements. Alternatively,
    value may be realized from these instruments that is
    significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated
    on the grant date and reported in our financial statements.



The application of these principles may be subject to further
    interpretation and refinement over time. There are significant
    differences among valuation models, and there is a possibility
    that we will adopt different valuation models in the future.
    This may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and
    materially affect the fair value estimate of stock-based
    payments. It may also result in a lack of comparability with
    other companies that use different models, methods, and
    assumptions.

Stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock
    options, RSUs, and employee stock purchases recognized under
    SFAS No. 123R for the year ended March 31, 2007
    was $154 million.

See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further information regarding
    SFAS No. 123R disclosures.

Income
    Taxes

We are required to compute our income taxes in each federal,
    state, and international jurisdiction in which we operate. This
    process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as
    well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and
    tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as
    accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax
    purposes. The income tax effects of the differences we identify
    are classified as current or long-term deferred tax assets and
    liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our judgments,
    assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for
    income tax take into account current tax laws, our
    interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of
    current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax
    authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax
    laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could
    significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of
    Income. We must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax
    assets will be realized from future taxable income and, based on
    this assessment, establish a valuation allowance, if required.
    Our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a
    number of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including
    forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and the relative
    proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various
    domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. To
    the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the
    valuation allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a
    corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our
    Consolidated Statements of Income, or to goodwill to the extent
    that the valuation allowance related to tax attributes of the
    acquired entities.

We failed to file in a timely fashion the final pre-acquisition
    tax return for Veritas, and as a result, it is uncertain whether
    we can claim a lower tax rate on a dividend made from a Veritas
    foreign subsidiary under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
    We are currently petitioning the IRS for relief to allow us to
    claim the lower rate of tax. Because we were unable to obtain
    this relief prior to filing the Veritas tax return in May 2006,
    we have paid $130 million of additional U.S. taxes.
    The potential outcomes with respect to our payment of this
    amount include:

•

If we ultimately obtain relief from the IRS on this matter, the
    $130 million that we paid in May 2006 will be refunded to
    us and we will use that amount to increase our income tax
    accrual for the Veritas transfer pricing disputes. For more
    information see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

•

If we ultimately do not receive relief from the IRS on this
    matter, and we otherwise have an adjustment arising from the
    Veritas transfer pricing disputes, then we would only owe
    additional tax with regard to such disputes to the extent that
    such adjustment is in excess of $130 million.

•

If we ultimately do not receive relief from the IRS on this
    matter, and we otherwise do not have an adjustment arising from
    the Veritas transfer pricing disputes, then (1) we would be
    required to adjust the purchase price of Veritas to reflect a
    reduction in the amount of pre-acquisition tax liabilities
    assumed; and (2) we would be required to recognize an equal
    amount of income tax expense, up to $130 million.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB,
    issued Interpretation No., or FIN, 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    SFAS No. 109.

The provisions of FIN 48 are
    effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. See
    “Newly Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting
    Pronouncements” under

We were required under purchase accounting rules to reduce the
    amount of Veritas’ deferred revenue that we recorded in
    connection with our July 2005 acquisition of Veritas to an
    amount equal to the fair value of our contractual obligation
    related to that deferred revenue. A portion of the increase in
    revenue related to storage and availability products and
    services in fiscal 2007 is due to the fact that the amount of
    revenue recognized in fiscal 2006 was lower as a result of the
    purchase accounting adjustment relating to deferred revenue. A
    majority of the increase in such revenue in fiscal 2006 is due
    to the fact that we had no such comparable revenue in fiscal
    2005 for those storage and availability products and services
    obtained through our acquisition of Veritas. Unless otherwise
    specified, “storage and availability products and
    services” include products and services obtained through
    our acquisition of Veritas, and complementary products and
    services obtained or developed subsequent to such acquisition.

Several factors have contributed to increased deferred revenue
    and lower current period revenue in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2007,
    we began negotiating more transactions that commit customers to
    multi-year periods, offer more flexibility in contractual terms
    and in product deployments, and provide more services in
    combination with license and maintenance sales. In the December
    2006 quarter, we combined our buying programs for all of our
    enterprise offerings to provide our customers and partners a
    single vendor relationship and simplify the way we do business.
    Previously, our storage and availability products and services
    were sold under Veritas’ pre-merger buying programs, while
    our security products and services were sold under our
    historical buying programs. These factors have resulted in, and
    will continue to result in, lower near-term recognized revenue
    growth rates. For example, an increase in multi-year contracts
    results in a higher level of revenue attributable to content

and/or

maintenance included in those transactions, which resulted in a
    larger portion of our revenues being recognized ratably over the
    term of the arrangement and a smaller portion being recognized
    in the current period. More flexibility in contractual terms,
    such as installment payments, increases our deferred revenue as
    such flexibility may result in ratable recognition or
    recognition on a due and payable basis.

Our customers have also requested increased flexibility in
    product deployments in site license arrangements. This may
    result in an increase in deferred revenue and classification of
    all revenues associated with the specific contract as Content,
    subscriptions, and maintenance revenue, which is recognized over
    time, as VSOE may not exist in certain types of flexible
    deployment contracts. As a result of our initiative to offer
    customers a more comprehensive solution to protect and manage a
    global IT infrastructure, we expect to see an increasing amount
    of services sold in conjunction with license and maintenance
    contracts. Inclusion of such services often results in increased
    deferred revenue and increased classification of revenues as
    Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue, as VSOE may not
    exist for some of the services provided. The combination of
    buying programs resulted in a change in the VSOE for some of our
    storage and availability products and services. This change,
    coupled with increased maintenance renewals sold with a license
    component, resulted in a larger portion of revenues associated
    with contracts being classified as Content, subscriptions, and
    maintenance revenue, which is subject to deferral, instead of
    Licenses revenue, which is generally recognized immediately.

Net revenues increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006
    primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability
    products and services that were obtained through our acquisition
    of Veritas for the full twelve months in the 2007 period
    compared to nine months in the 2006 period. These products and
    services contributed $518 million of net revenues in the
    June 2006 quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in
    the June 2005 quarter. In addition, the purchase accounting
    adjustment contributed $271 million (cumulatively) in the
    September 2006, December 2006, and March 2007 quarters as
    compared to the comparable quarters of the prior year. The



remainder of the revenue increase is due to increases in our
    consumer products revenue and services offerings of
    $181 million and $83 million, respectively, due to
    continued growth in demand. The segment discussions that follow
    further describe the revenue increases. These increases are
    partially offset by the effects of the increased flexibility in
    contract terms and the combination of our buying programs
    discussed above.

Net revenues increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005
    primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability
    products and services obtained through our acquisition of
    Veritas. These products and services contributed
    $1.4 billion of net revenues in fiscal 2006 for which there
    was no comparable revenue in fiscal 2005. In addition, revenues
    from our enterprise security products increased
    $122 million and revenues from our consumer products
    increased $67 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal
    2005. The increased revenues from these products were due
    primarily to continued growth in demand for our enterprise virus
    protection and anti-spam solutions as well as our consumer
    security protection products, as described further in the
    segment discussions that follow. Beginning in the December 2005
    quarter, as a result of increases in future subscription pricing
    for our 2006 consumer products that include content updates,
    revenue for these products is recognized on a ratable basis over
    the term of the subscription.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue includes
    arrangements for software maintenance and technical support for
    our products, content and subscription services primarily
    related to our security products, revenue from arrangements
    where VSOE of the fair value of undelivered elements does not
    exist, and managed security services. These arrangements are
    generally offered to our customers over a specified period of
    time and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the
    maintenance, subscription, or service period. Beginning with the
    release of our 2006 consumer products that include content
    updates in the December 2005 quarter, we recognize revenue
    related to these products ratably. As a result, this revenue has
    been classified as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance
    beginning in the December 2005 quarter. In addition, as noted
    above, increased flexibility in contract terms and the
    combination of our buying programs in the December 2006 quarter
    have impacted revenue recognition. These changes caused a larger
    portion of revenue associated with contracts to be classified as
    Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue, which is
    subject to deferral, instead of Licenses revenue, which is
    generally recognized immediately, as discussed above in
    “Total Net Revenues.”

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue also includes
    professional services revenue, which consists primarily of the
    fees we earn related to consulting and educational services. We
    generally recognize revenue from our professional services as
    the services are performed or upon written acceptance from
    customers, if applicable, assuming all other conditions for
    revenue recognition have been met.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues increased in
    fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the
    inclusion of the storage and availability products and services
    obtained through our acquisition of Veritas for the full twelve
    months in the 2007 period compared to nine months in the 2006
    period. These products and services contributed
    $250 million of Content, subscriptions, and maintenance
    revenues in the June 2006 quarter for which there was no
    comparable revenue in the June 2005 quarter. In addition, in
    fiscal 2007, Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue
    related to our enterprise products increased $271 million
    due to the fact that the amount of revenue recognized in the
    comparable 2006 period was lower as a result of the purchase
    accounting adjustment discussed under “Total Net
    Revenues” above. Revenue related to our consumer products
    increased $179 million as compared to the 2006 period due
    primarily to growth in Norton Internet Security products and
    online revenues due to growth in the use of the Internet, and
    increased awareness and sophistication of security threats.
    Enterprise products and services, excluding Veritas-related
    products and services, increased $309 million as



a result of growth in our maintenance renewals due to an
    increasing installed base, increased demand for our service
    offerings, other acquisitions, and the combination of our buying
    programs implemented in the December 2006 quarter, which
    impacted VSOE methodology and classification of Licenses revenue
    and Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue, as
    discussed above under “Total Net Revenues.”

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues increased in
    fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the
    inclusion of the storage and availability products and services
    obtained through our acquisition of Veritas. These product and
    services contributed $534 million of Content,
    subscriptions, and maintenance revenues in fiscal 2006 for which
    there was no comparable revenue in fiscal 2005. In addition, in
    fiscal 2006, Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues
    related to our consumer security products increased
    $233 million as compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to
    the classification of $160 million of consumer revenue as
    Content, subscriptions, and maintenance (rather than Licenses)
    in fiscal 2006 as a result of recognizing revenue from sales of
    consumer products that include content updates ratably beginning
    in the December 2005 quarter as discussed above. Revenue related
    to our enterprise security products increased $133 million,
    primarily due to increased awareness of information security
    threats.

Licenses revenue increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal
    2006 primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and
    availability products obtained through our acquisition of
    Veritas for the full twelve months in the 2007 period compared
    to nine months in the 2006 period. These products contributed
    $268 million of Licenses revenues in the June 2006 quarter
    for which there was no comparable revenue in the June 2006
    quarter. Excluding this June 2006 contribution, License revenues
    were down significantly in both Security and Data Management and
    Data Center Management segments as a result of the increased
    flexibility in contract terms and the combination of our buying
    programs implemented in the December 2006 quarter, both of which
    caused a larger portion of contracts to be classified as
    Content, subscriptions, and maintenance, which is subject to
    deferral, instead of Licenses revenue, which is generally
    recognized immediately, as discussed above in “Total Net
    Revenues.”

Licenses revenue increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal
    2005 primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and
    availability products obtained through our acquisition of
    Veritas. These products contributed $835 million of
    Licenses revenue in fiscal 2006 for which there was no
    comparable revenue in fiscal 2005. Our 2006 consumer products
    that include content updates were released in the December 2005
    quarter, and we recognize revenue related to these products
    ratably as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues,
    which resulted in a decrease in Licenses revenue of
    $160 million in fiscal 2006. Competitive pressures, a lack
    of high profile information security threat activity during
    fiscal 2006, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in licensing of
    our enterprise security products, also partially offset the
    overall increase in Licenses revenue.

Consumer Products revenues increased in fiscal 2007 as compared
    to fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase of $293 million
    in revenue from our Norton Internet Security products. This
    increase was partially offset by aggregate decreases in revenue
    from our Norton AntiVirus and Norton System
    Works

tm

products of $100 million. These decreases resulted from our
    customers’ continued migration to the Norton Internet
    Security products, which offer broader protection to address the
    rapidly changing threat environment. Our electronic orders
    include OEM subscriptions, upgrades, online sales, and renewals.
    Revenue from electronic orders (which includes sales of our
    Norton Internet Security products and our Norton AntiVirus
    products) grew by $221 million in fiscal 2007 as compared
    to fiscal 2006.

Consumer Products revenues increased in fiscal 2006 as compared
    to fiscal 2005 primarily due to an increase of $156 million
    in revenue from our Norton Internet Security products. The
    majority of the increase in revenue was booked through
    electronic orders. This increase was partially offset by the
    change in our consumer product revenue recognition model for our
    2006 consumer products that include content updates. Beginning
    in the December 2005 quarter, as a result of increases in future
    subscription pricing for our 2006 consumer products that include
    content updates, revenue for these products is recognized
    ratably over the term of the subscription upon sell through to
    end-users. This change in our product revenue recognition model
    resulted in a 7% reduction in Consumer Products revenues for
    fiscal 2006. In addition, revenue from our Norton AntiVirus
    products decreased $67 million as our customers migrated to
    the Norton Internet Security products. Revenue from our
    electronic distribution channel grew by $168 million in
    fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. We believe that, in
    addition to the factors noted above, the lower growth rate in
    our Consumer Products segment was attributable to a reduced
    threat environment in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. In
    addition, during fiscal 2006, pricing for subscriptions
    increased while pricing in retail and online stores remained
    consistent or decreased.

    Management revenue in the June 2006 quarter for which there was
    no comparable revenue in the June 2005 quarter. In addition the
    purchase accounting adjustment, discussed under “Total Net

    (cumulatively) in the September 2006, December 2006, and March
    2007 quarters as compared to the comparable quarters of the
    prior year. In addition, revenues increased $40 million in
    fiscal 2007 as a result of acquisitions, excluding Veritas, for
    which there was not a full twelve months of revenue or no
    comparable revenue in fiscal 2006.

Security and Data Management revenues increased in fiscal 2006

The Data Center Management segment is comprised of storage and
    availability products. The increase in Data Center Management
    revenue in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily
    due to the inclusion of storage and availability products
    obtained through our acquisition of Veritas for the full twelve
    month period compared to nine months in the fiscal 2006 period.
    These products contributed $339 million of Data Center
    Management revenue in the June 2006 quarter for which there was
    no comparable revenue in the June 2005 quarter. The effect of
    the purchase accounting adjustment discussed under “Total
    Net Revenues” above also contributed $173 million to
    the increase in revenue in fiscal 2007. Excluding the effects of
    the aforementioned items, revenue in fiscal 2007 as compared to
    fiscal 2006 was relatively flat due to the combination of the
    buying programs for all of our enterprise offerings in the
    December 2006 quarter. This combination resulted in lower
    recognized revenue and increased deferred revenue as discussed
    under “Total Net Revenues” above.

In fiscal 2006, the Data Center Management segment was solely
    comprised of the storage and availability products obtained
    through our acquisition of Veritas. Revenue from our Data Center
    Management segment was $861 million in fiscal 2006 and was
    comprised primarily of revenue related to Storage Foundation and
    Server Foundation product families and NetBackup products of
    $501 million and $332 million, respectively.

Revenue from our Services segment increased in fiscal 2007 as

    security consulting services and the inclusion of the storage
    and availability services obtained through our acquisition of
    Veritas for the full twelve months in the 2007 period compared
    to nine months in the 2006 period. These acquired services
    offerings contributed $28 million of Services revenues in
    the June 2006 quarter for which there was no comparable revenue
    in the June 2005 quarter.

The increase in revenue from our Services segment in fiscal 2006
    as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the inclusion of
    the storage and availability services obtained through our
    acquisition of Veritas. These services contributed
    $94 million of services revenues during fiscal 2006 for
    which there was no comparable revenue in fiscal 2005. In
    addition, the increase was due to an increase in our security
    consulting services of $13 million in fiscal 2006 as
    compared to fiscal 2005.

Other

Our Other segment is comprised primarily of sunset products and

    insignificant.

International revenues increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to
    fiscal 2006 primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and
    availability products and services obtained through our
    acquisition of Veritas for the full twelve months in the 2007
    period compared to nine months in the 2006 period. These
    products and services contributed $240 million of
    international revenues in the June 2006 quarter for which there
    was no comparable revenue in the June 2005 quarter. In North
    America, these products contributed $277 million in the
    June 2006 quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in
    the June 2005 quarter. In addition, a portion of the revenue
    increase in fiscal 2007 is due to the fact that the amount of
    revenue recognized in the comparable 2006 period was lower as a
    result of the purchase accounting adjustment discussed under
    “Total Net Revenues” above. The purchase accounting
    adjustment increased fiscal 2007 revenues by $186 million
    in North America and $85 million in the international
    regions compared to fiscal 2006. Growth in our Consumer Products
    segment, driven by Norton Internet Security, resulted in a
    $137 million increase in the international regions and a
    $44 million increase in North America in fiscal 2007
    revenues versus fiscal 2006. Both domestic and international
    revenue from enterprise offerings were negatively impacted
    primarily due to the increased flexibility in our contract terms
    and the combination of our buying programs. These changes
    resulted in a larger portion of contracts being subject to
    deferral and a correspondingly lower amount of revenue
    recognized in the current period, as discussed in “Total
    Net Revenues” above. Foreign currencies had a favorable
    impact on net revenues of $105 million in fiscal 2007
    compared to fiscal 2006.

International revenues increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to
    fiscal 2005 primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and
    availability products and services obtained through our
    acquisition of Veritas. These product and services contributed
    $661 million of international revenues for which there was
    no comparable revenue in fiscal 2005. Increased sales of our
    Norton Internet Security products in our Consumer Products
    segment and our antivirus



and antispam products in our Security and Data Management
    segment also contributed to the increase in net revenue in the
    international regions in fiscal 2006, while the change to
    ratable revenue recognition with the release of the 2006
    consumer products that include content updates partially offset
    this increase. Weakness in most major foreign currencies
    negatively impacted our international revenue growth by
    $48 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005.

We are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future
    periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates. If international sales become a greater portion of our
    total sales in the future, changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenues and
    operating results.

Cost of revenues consists primarily of amortization of acquired
    product rights, fee-based technical support costs, costs of
    billable services, payments to OEMs under revenue-sharing
    arrangements, manufacturing and direct material costs, and
    royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing
    agreements.

Gross margin increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006
    due primarily to higher revenues more than offsetting year over
    year increases in services and technical support costs. We
    anticipate that our net revenues from our Services segment may
    grow to comprise a higher percentage of our total net revenues,
    which would have a negative impact on our gross margin, as our
    services typically have a higher cost of revenues than our
    software products. Gross margin was also impacted as the terms
    of several of our OEM arrangements changed from revenue-sharing
    arrangements to placement fee arrangements during fiscal 2007.
    Placement fee arrangements are expensed on an estimated average
    cost basis, while revenue-sharing arrangements are amortized
    ratably over a one-year period.

Gross margin decreased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005
    due primarily to increased amortization of acquired product
    rights resulting from certain identifiable intangible assets
    acquired through the Veritas acquisition. Costs for services and
    technical support also increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to
    fiscal 2005. These increases were partially offset by ratable
    recognition of costs for 2006 consumer products that include
    content updates, which are recognized ratably over the term of
    the license beginning in the December 2005 quarter.

Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance consists

    agreements.

Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance remained
    relatively constant as a percentage of the related revenue in
    fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. The year over year
    increase in costs is primarily driven by sales of products
    acquired through the Veritas acquisition, which contributed
    $98 million of incremental costs in fiscal 2007



relative to fiscal 2006 and contributed 28% of the related
    Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue in fiscal 2007.
    In addition, costs related to our security services consulting
    and consumer products increased $34 million and
    $37 million, respectively.

We expect our gross margin and operating expenses to be affected
    in future periods as a result of recent changes in the terms of
    some of our key OEM relationships. We have negotiated new
    contract terms with some of our OEM partners which will have the
    effect of moving our OEM payments from Cost of revenues to
    Operating expenses. Our past OEM payments were primarily
    revenue-sharing arrangements, which were amortized to Cost of
    revenues over a one-year period. Several of the arrangements
    negotiated in late fiscal 2007 are placement fee arrangements,
    for which the costs are expensed on an estimated average cost
    basis.

Cost of content, subscriptions, and maintenance increased as a
    percentage of the related revenue in fiscal 2006 as compared to
    fiscal 2005 due primarily to sales of products acquired through
    the Veritas acquisition, which contributed $228 million of
    additional costs and contributed 43% of the related Content,
    subscriptions, and maintenance revenue in fiscal 2006. In
    addition, costs related to our security services consulting

Cost of licenses consists primarily of royalties paid to third

    and direct material costs. Cost of licenses remained constant as
    a percentage of the related revenue in fiscal 2007 as compared
    to fiscal 2006. The year over year increase in absolute dollars
    is primarily due to amortization of stock-based compensation
    expense, offset in part by lower costs associated with products
    acquired through the Veritas acquisition, which added
    $9 million of costs in fiscal 2007 and $13 million in
    fiscal 2006.

Cost of licenses decreased as a percentage of the related
    revenue in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily
    to lower costs associated with products acquired through the
    Veritas acquisition. The Veritas acquisition added
    $13 million of costs in fiscal 2006, which was offset by a
    $17 million decrease in consumer products license costs as
    compared to fiscal 2005. These costs and the associated revenue
    are reported as Content, subscriptions, and maintenance
    beginning with the release of our 2006 consumer products in the
    December 2005 quarter that include content updates, as we now
    recognize the revenue and related costs ratably over the content

Acquired product rights are comprised of developed technologies,

The amortization in fiscal 2007 and 2006 is primarily associated

    increase in employee headcount. Higher employee compensation
    expense includes the effect of adopting of
    SFAS No. 123R, which added $56 million of
    stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2007 for which there
    is no comparable expense in fiscal 2006. In addition,
    approximately $171 million of the increase is due to an
    additional three months of sales and marketing expenses related
    to the Veritas acquisition, which is included for the full year
    of fiscal 2007 as compared to nine months in fiscal 2006.
    Advertising expense increased by approximately $129 million
    in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily as a result
    of changes in our OEM arrangements discussed below.

Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues
    increased to 36% in fiscal 2006 as compared to 33% in fiscal
    2005. The percentage increase and increase in absolute dollars
    in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2006 as compared to
    fiscal 2005 was due primarily to the Veritas acquisition, which
    contributed $579 million in additional sales and marketing
    expenses for which there were no comparable expenses in fiscal
    2005. The remaining increase in sales and marketing expenses was
    due primarily to an increase in employee headcount, resulting in
    additional employee compensation expense.

We have negotiated new contract terms with some of our OEM
    partners which will have the effect of moving our OEM payments
    from Cost of revenues to Operating expenses, as discussed above
    under “Financial Results and Trends.” As a result, we
    expect our Sales and marketing expenses to increase.

Research and development expense as a percentage of total
    revenues remained relatively constant in fiscal 2007 and fiscal
    2006. The increase in absolute dollars in research and
    development expenses in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006
    was due primarily to higher employee compensation expense of
    approximately $108 million resulting from an increase in
    employee headcount. Higher employee compensation expense
    includes the effect of adopting of SFAS No. 123R,
    which added $57 million of stock-based compensation expense
    in fiscal



2007 for which there is no comparable expense in fiscal 2006. In
    addition, approximately $96 million of the increase is due
    to an additional three months of research and development
    expenses related to the Veritas acquisition, which is included
    for the full year of fiscal 2007 as compared to nine months in
    fiscal 2006.

Research and development expense as a percentage of total
    revenues increased to 16% in fiscal 2006 as compared to 13% in
    fiscal 2005. The percentage increase and increase in absolute
    dollars in research and development expenses in fiscal 2006 as
    compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to the Veritas
    acquisition, which contributed $320 million in additional
    research and development expenses for which there were no

General and administrative expense as a percentage of total
    revenues was relatively constant in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006.
    The increase in absolute dollars in general and administrative
    expenses in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due
    primarily to higher employee compensation expense of
    approximately $73 million resulting from an increase in
    employee headcount. Higher employee compensation includes the
    effect of adopting SFAS No. 123R, which added
    $24 million of stock-based compensation expense in fiscal
    2007 for which there is no comparable expense in fiscal 2006. In
    addition, approximately $20 million of the increase is due
    to an additional three months of general and administrative
    expenses related to the Veritas acquisition, which are included
    for the full year in fiscal 2007 as compared to nine months in
    fiscal 2006.

General and administrative expense as a percentage of total
    revenues increased slightly in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal
    2005. The increase in absolute dollars in general and
    administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal
    2005 was due primarily to the Veritas acquisition, which
    contributed $81 million in additional general and
    administrative expenses for which there were no comparable
    expenses in fiscal 2005. The remaining increase in general and
    administrative expenses was due primarily to an increase in
    employee headcount, resulting in additional employee
    compensation expense.

Other intangible assets are comprised of customer base, trade
    names, partnership agreements, and marketing-related assets. The
    increased amortization in fiscal 2007 is primarily associated
    with a full year of amortization associated with the Veritas
    acquisition which occurred in July 2005 and the acquisitions of
    Company-i Limited and 4FrontSecurity, Inc. that occurred during
    fiscal 2007. We recorded $9 million of other intangible
    assets associated with the Company-i and 4FrontSecurity,
    acquisitions which will be amortized over their useful lives of
    one to eight years.



The increased amortization in fiscal 2006 is primarily
    associated with the Veritas acquisition, for which amortization
    began in July 2005. In connection with the Veritas acquisition,
    we recorded $1.5 billion in other intangible assets which
    will be amortized over their useful lives of eight to ten years.
    For further discussion of other intangible assets from
    acquisitions and related amortization, see Notes 3 and 4 of

During fiscal 2006, we wrote off IPR&D totaling
    $285 million, of which $284 million was in connection
    with our acquisition of Veritas. The IPR&D was written off
    because the acquired technologies had not reached technological
    feasibility and had no alternative uses. Technological
    feasibility is defined as being equivalent to completion of a
    beta-phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk
    relating to the development. At the time of the acquisition in
    July 2005, Veritas was developing new products in multiple
    product areas that qualify as IPR&D. These efforts included
    NetBackup 6.1, Backup Exec 11.0, Server Management 5.0, and
    various other projects. At the time of the acquisition, it was
    estimated that these IPR&D development efforts would be
    completed over the following 12 to 18 months at an
    estimated total cost of $120 million. As of March 31,
    2007, the majority of all IPR&D projects had been completed
    on schedule and within expected costs, except for one small
    project which is expected to be completed within the next
    six months.

In fiscal 2005, we wrote off $3 million of IPR&D in
    connection with our acquisition of Brightmail. The Brightmail
    IPR&D related to the third generation of Brightmail’s
    antispam product offering.

In fiscal 2007, we recorded approximately $70 million of
    restructuring and employee termination benefit expenses which
    consist of $19 million related to severance, associated
    benefits, and outplacement services for the termination of
    approximately 323 employees located in the Americas, Europe and
    Asia Pacific and $51 million dollars related to the 2007
    cost savings initiative announced in January 2007. We
    implemented the 2007 cost savings initiative to better align our
    expenses with our new revenue expectations. The costs included
    in our 2007 cost savings initiative reflect $51 million
    related to severance, associated benefits, and outplacement
    services and an insignificant amount related to excess
    facilities. The restructuring and employee termination benefit
    costs under the 2007 cost savings initiative reflect the
    termination of approximately 988 employees located in the
    Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific and the consolidation of
    certain facilities in Europe and Asia Pacific. We paid
    $24 million under the restructuring and employee
    termination benefit reserves established in fiscal 2007. We
    expect the remainder of the costs to be paid by the end of
    fiscal 2008. We expect that the 2007 cost savings initiative
    will result in an additional restructuring charge in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2008 and potentially in other future periods.

In fiscal 2006, we recorded $25 million of restructuring
    costs, of which $18 million related to severance,
    associated benefits, and outplacement services and
    $7 million related to excess facilities. These
    restructuring costs reflect the termination of 446 redundant
    employees located in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific and
    the consolidation of certain facilities in Europe and Asia
    Pacific. At March 31, 2006, $9 million remained
    related to this reserve. In fiscal 2007, we paid $4 million
    related to this restructuring reserve. At March 31, 2007,
    $5 million remained related to this reserve, the majority
    of which relate to restructured facilities. We expect the
    remainder of the costs to be paid by the end of fiscal 2018.

In fiscal 2005, we recorded $3 million of restructuring
    charges, of which $2 million was for costs of severance,
    related benefits, and outplacement services related to the
    termination of 51 employees located in the U.S. and



Europe due to the consolidation and relocation of engineering
    and development functions. In addition we recorded an increase
    to the accrual relating to the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan of
    $1 million due to the termination of a sublease agreement
    for facilities in Eugene, Oregon. Substantially all of the costs
    had been paid by March 31, 2005.

Integration

In fiscal 2007, we recorded $1 million of integration
    charges in connection with our April 2007 acquisition of
    Altiris. These integration charges consisted of costs incurred
    for consulting services and other professional fees. We expect
    to incur additional integration costs related to Altiris in
    fiscal 2008. In connection with our acquisition of Veritas, we
    recorded integration costs of $16 million in fiscal 2006
    and $3 million in fiscal 2005, which consisted primarily of
    costs incurred for consulting services and other professional
    fees.

Patent
    settlement

On May 12, 2005, we resolved patent litigation matters with
    Altiris, Inc. by entering into a cross-licensing agreement that
    resolved all legal claims between the companies. As part of the
    settlement, we paid Altiris $10 million for use of the
    disputed technology. Under the transaction, we expensed
    $2 million of patent settlement costs in the June 2005
    quarter that was related to benefits received in and prior to
    the June 2005 quarter. The remaining $8 million was
    recorded as Acquired product rights in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets and is being amortized to Cost of revenues in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining life of the
    primary patent, which expires in May 2017. In April 2007, we
    acquired Altiris. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated

The increase in Interest income in fiscal 2007 as compared to
    fiscal 2006 was due primarily to a higher average investment
    balance and higher average interest rates realized on our
    invested cash and

available-for-sale

securities. The increase in Interest income in fiscal 2006 as
    compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to a higher average
    investment balance, due to the cash acquired through the Veritas
    acquisition, and higher average interest rates.

Interest expense in fiscal 2007 was due primarily to the
    interest and amortization of issuance costs related to our 0.75%
    and 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes issued in June 2006. In
    addition, the period includes interest and accretion related to
    the 0.25% Convertible Subordinated Notes that we assumed in
    connection with our acquisition of Veritas. The 0.25% Veritas
    Convertible Subordinated Notes were paid in full during August
    2006. Interest expense in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to the
    Veritas 0.25% Convertible Subordinated Notes. Interest
    expense in fiscal 2005 was primarily related to our
    $600 million 3% convertible subordinated notes issued
    in October 2001. In November 2004, substantially all of the
    outstanding convertible subordinated notes were converted into
    70.3 million shares of our common stock and the remainder
    was redeemed for cash.

In fiscal 2007, Other income (expense), net includes a gain of
    $20 million on the sale of our buildings in Milpitas,
    California, and Maidenhead, United Kingdom.

Our effective tax rate on Income before income taxes was
    approximately 36%, 57%, and 38% in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005,
    respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 reflects
    the impact of non-deductible stock-based compensation and the
    fiscal 2003 and 2004 Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, audit
    settlement. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 reflects the
    impact of the IPR&D charges and other acquisition-related
    charges that are nondeductible for tax reporting purposes,
    partially offset by foreign earnings taxed at a lower rate than
    the U.S. tax rate, and the effect of the

true-up

of
    taxes on repatriated earnings. The effective tax rate in fiscal
    2005 reflects the additional tax expense attributable to the
    $500 million of foreign earnings that we repatriated under
    the American Jobs Creation Act.

We believe realization of substantially all of our deferred tax
    assets as of March 31, 2007 of $578 million, after
    application of the valuation allowance, is more likely than not
    based on the future reversal of temporary tax differences.
    Realization of approximately $43 million of our deferred
    tax assets as of March 31, 2007 is dependent upon future
    taxable earnings exclusive of reversing temporary differences in
    certain foreign jurisdictions. Levels of future taxable income
    are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in
    Item 1A,

Risk Factors,

set forth in this annual
    report. An additional valuation allowance against net deferred
    tax assets may be necessary if it is more likely than not that
    all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be
    realized. We will assess the need for an additional valuation
    allowance on a quarterly basis. Of the $60 million total
    valuation allowance provided against our deferred tax assets,
    approximately $54 million is attributable to
    acquisition-related assets, the benefit of which will reduce
    goodwill when and if realized. The valuation allowance decreased
    by $6 million in fiscal 2007, all of which was attributable
    to acquisition-related assets, the benefit of which reduced
    goodwill. The valuation allowance increased by $59 million
    in fiscal 2006, of which approximately $58 million was
    attributable to acquisition-related assets.

American
    Jobs Creation Act of 2004 — Repatriation of foreign
    earnings

In the March 2005 quarter, we repatriated $500 million from
    certain of our foreign subsidiaries that qualified for the 85%
    dividends received deduction under the provisions of the
    American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the Jobs Act, enacted in
    October 2004. We recorded a tax charge for this repatriation of
    $54 million in the March 2005 quarter.

In May 2005, clarifying language was issued by the
    U.S. Department of Treasury and the IRS with respect to the
    treatment of foreign taxes paid on the earnings repatriated
    under the Jobs Act and in September 2005, additional clarifying
    language was issued regarding the treatment of certain
    deductions attributable to the earnings repatriation. As a
    result of this clarifying language, we reduced the tax expense
    attributable to the repatriation by approximately
    $21 million in fiscal 2006, which reduced the cumulative
    tax charge on the repatriation to $33 million.

Other
    tax matters

On March 29, 2006, we received a Notice of Deficiency from
    the IRS claiming that we owe additional taxes, plus interest and
    penalties, for the 2000 and 2001 tax years based on an audit of
    Veritas, which we acquired in July 2005. The incremental tax
    liability asserted by the IRS with regard to the Veritas claim
    was $867 million, excluding penalties and interest. The
    Notice of Deficiency primarily relates to transfer pricing in
    connection with a technology license agreement between Veritas
    and a foreign subsidiary. We do not agree with the IRS position.
    On June 26, 2006, we filed a petition with the
    U.S. Tax Court to protest a Notice of Deficiency. On
    August 30, 2006, the IRS



answered our petition and the case has been docketed for trial
    in U.S. Tax Court. In the March 2007 quarter, the IRS
    agreed to dismiss any penalty assessment, and we have otherwise
    agreed to settle several of the lesser issues (representing
    $35 million of the total assessment) for $7 million of
    tax. As a result, the outstanding issue represents
    $832 million of tax. No payments will be made on the
    assessment until the issue is definitively resolved. If, upon
    resolution, we are required to pay an amount in excess of our
    provision for this matter, the incremental amounts due would be
    accounted for principally as additions to the Veritas purchase
    price as an increase to goodwill. Any incremental interest
    accrued subsequent to the date of the Veritas acquisition would
    be recorded as an expense in the period the matter is resolved.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we made $90 million
    of tax-related adjustments to the purchase accounting for
    Veritas, consisting of $120 million of additional
    pre-acquisition tax reserve-related adjustments, partially
    offset by a $30 million reduction in other pre-acquisition
    taxes payable. While we strongly disagree with the IRS over both
    its transfer pricing methodologies and the amount of the
    assessment, we have established additional tax reserves for all
    Veritas pre-acquisition years to account for both contingent tax
    and interest risk.

On March 30, 2006, we received notices of proposed
    adjustment from the IRS with regard to an unrelated audit of
    Symantec for fiscal 2003 and 2004. The IRS claimed that we owed
    an incremental tax liability with regard to this audit of
    $110 million, excluding penalties and interest. The
    incremental tax liability primarily relates to transfer pricing
    matters between Symantec and a foreign subsidiary. On
    September 5, 2006, we executed a closing agreement with the
    IRS with respect to the audit of Symantec’s fiscal 2003 and
    2004 federal income tax returns. The closing agreement
    represents the final assessment by the IRS of additional tax for
    these fiscal years of approximately $35 million, including
    interest. Based on the final settlement, a tax benefit of
    $8 million was recognized.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we increased our tax
    reserves by an additional $64 million in connection with
    all open Symantec tax years (fiscal 2003 to 2006). Since these
    reserves relate to licensing arising from acquired technology,
    the additional accruals are primarily offset by deferred taxes.

We are as yet unable to confirm our eligibility to claim a lower
    tax rate on a distribution made from a Veritas foreign
    subsidiary prior to the acquisition. The distribution was
    intended to be made pursuant to the Jobs Act, and therefore
    eligible for a 5.25% effective U.S. federal rate of tax, in
    lieu of the 35% statutory rate. We are seeking a ruling from the
    IRS on the matter. Because we were unable to obtain this ruling
    prior to filing the Veritas tax return in May 2006, we have paid
    $130 million of additional U.S. taxes. Since this
    payment relates to the taxability of foreign earnings that are
    otherwise the subject of the IRS assessment, this additional
    payment reduced the amount of taxes payable accrued as part of
    the purchase accounting for pre-acquisition contingent tax
    risks. For further information, see Note 13 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements and

Critical Accounting
    Estimates — Income Taxes

above.

In connection with the note hedge transactions discussed in
    Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, we established a deferred tax asset of approximately
    $232 million to account for the book-tax basis difference
    in the convertible notes resulting from note hedge transactions.
    The deferred tax asset has been accounted for as an increase to
    Capital in excess of par value.

As of March 31, 2007, our principal source of liquidity was
    our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments
    of $3.0 billion, of which 53% was held domestically and the
    remainder was held outside of the U.S. In April 2007, we
    completed our acquisition of Altiris, Inc., a leading provider
    of IT management software that enables businesses to easily
    manage and service network-based endpoints. We used a portion of
    our domestic cash balance to fund the aggregate purchase price,
    excluding acquisition related costs, of approximately
    $815 million in cash, which amount is net of Altiris’
    cash balance. As a result approximately two-thirds of our cash,
    cash equivalents, and short-term investments balance is
    currently held outside of the U.S. At the beginning of fiscal
    2007, we completed the reorganization of certain international
    subsidiaries acquired as part of the Veritas acquisition.

In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion principal amount of
    0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2011, and
    $1.0 billion principal amount of 1.00% Convertible Senior
    Notes due June 15, 2013, to initial purchasers in a private
    offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant
    to SEC Rule 144A. We refer to these Notes collectively as
    the Senior Notes. Concurrently with the issuance of the Senior
    Notes, we entered into note hedge transactions with affiliates
    of certain of the initial purchasers whereby we have the option
    to purchase up to 110 million shares of our common stock at
    a price of $19.12 per share. In addition, concurrently with the
    issuance of the Senior Notes, we also sold warrants to
    affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers whereby they
    have the option to purchase up to 110 million shares of our
    common stock at a price of $27.3175 per share. The warrants
    expire on various dates from July 2011 through August 2013 and
    must be settled in net shares.

For additional information regarding the Senior Notes and
    related transactions, see Note 6 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is
    incorporated herein by reference. For information regarding the
    deferred tax asset established in connection with the note hedge
    transactions, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated

The cost incurred in connection with the note hedge
    transactions, net of the related tax benefit and the proceeds
    from the sale of the warrants, is included as a net reduction in

On August 1, 2006, at the option of certain of the holders,
    we repurchased for cash $510 million of the Veritas
    0.25% Convertible Subordinated Notes, or the
    0.25% Notes, that we had assumed in connection with the
    acquisition of Veritas at a price equal to the principal amount,
    plus accrued and unpaid interest. On August 28, 2006, at
    our election, we repurchased the remaining $10 million of
    the Veritas 0.25% Notes at a price equal to the principal
    amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. For additional
    information regarding the 0.25% Notes, see Note 6 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which
    information is incorporated herein by reference.

In July 2006, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior
    unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in July 2011.
    Borrowings under the facility will bear interest, at our option,
    at either a rate equal to the bank’s base rate or a rate
    equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on our leverage ratio, as
    defined in the credit facility agreement. In connection with the
    credit facility, we must maintain certain covenants, including a
    specified ratio of debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest,
    taxes, depreciation, and amortization), as well as various other
    non-financial covenants. At March 31, 2007, we were in
    compliance with all covenants. We have made no borrowings under
    the credit facility through the date of filing of this annual
    report.

During April 2006, we purchased two office buildings totaling
    approximately 236,000 square feet in Cupertino, California
    for $81 million. Approximately 64,000 square feet is
    leased to a third party. In September 2006, we sold a building
    in Milpitas, California for net proceeds of $83 million. In
    January 2007, we sold a building in Maidenhead, England for net
    proceeds of $35 million.

On January 24, 2007, we announced that the Board of
    Directors authorized the repurchase of $1 billion of
    Symantec common stock without a scheduled expiration date.

We believe that our cash balances, cash that we generate over
    time from operations, and our borrowing capacity will be
    sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working
    capital and capital expenditures for at least the next
    12 months.



Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2007
    resulted largely from net income of $404 million, plus
    non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of
    $811 million, non-cash stock-based compensation expense of
    $154 million, and an increase in deferred revenue of
    $400 million. These amounts were partially offset by a
    decrease in income taxes payable of $182 million, primarily
    due to the timing of tax payments. We expect operating cash flow
    to continue to be positive in the future.

Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2006
    resulted largely from net income of $157 million, plus an
    increase in deferred revenue of $683 million, non-cash
    charges, primarily for depreciation and amortization, of
    $640 million, and the write off of IPR&D of
    $285 million related to the acquisitions of Veritas and
    BindView. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in
    deferred income taxes of $203 million and by an increase in
    trade accounts receivable of $87 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2005
    resulted largely from net income of $536 million, plus
    non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of
    $127 million, the income tax benefit from employee stock
    plans of $109 million, and deferred income taxes of
    $61 million. In addition, our deferred revenue increased by
    $319 million and income taxes payable increased by
    $56 million.

Investing
    Activities

Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007 was
    primarily the result of capital expenditures of
    $420 million, including $81 million for the purchase
    of two office buildings in Cupertino, California, and purchases
    of

available-for-sale

securities of $227 million. These amounts were partially
    offset by proceeds of $349 million from sales of

available-for-sale

securities and net proceeds from the sale of property and
    equipment, primarily buildings in Milpitas, California and
    Maidenhead, England, of $121 million.

Net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2006 was
    primarily the result of net sales of

available-for-sale

securities of $3.4 billion and cash of $541 million
    acquired through the acquisition of Veritas, net of cash
    expenditures for our other acquisitions in fiscal 2006. These
    amounts were partially offset by capital expenditures of
    $267 million, including $63 million for the purchase
    of two buildings in Mountain View, California.

Net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2005 was
    primarily the result of payments for business acquisitions of
    $424 million and net purchases of

available-for-sale

securities of $143 million.

Financing
    Activities

In the June 2006 quarter, we issued the Senior Notes for net
    proceeds of approximately $2.1 billion. We used
    $1.5 billion of the proceeds to repurchase shares of our
    common stock, as discussed below. We also purchased hedges
    related to the Senior Notes for $592 million and received
    proceeds of $326 million from the sale of common stock
    warrants. In addition, we applied the remainder of the proceeds
    from the Senior Notes to the $520 million used to
    repurchase the Veritas 0.25% Notes in August 2006.

We have operated stock repurchase programs since 2001. As of
    January 2007, we completed the $1 billion share repurchase
    program announced in January 2006 as well as the
    $1.5 billion share repurchase program announced in June
    2006. On January 24, 2007, we announced that our Board of
    Directors authorized the repurchase of $1 billion of
    Symantec common stock, without a scheduled expiration date.

During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 162 million shares of
    our common stock at prices ranging from $15.61 to
    $21.66 per share for an aggregate amount of
    $2.8 billion. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased
    174 million shares at prices ranging from $15.83 to
    $23.85 per share for an aggregate amount of
    $3.6 billion. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased eight
    million shares at prices ranging from $21.05 to $30.77 per
    share, for an aggregate amount of $192 million. As of
    March 31, 2007, $500 million remained authorized for
    future repurchases. For further information regarding our stock
    repurchases, see Item 5,

Market for Registrant’s
    Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases
    of Equity Securities,

of this annual report.

In fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, we received net proceeds of
    $230 million, $210 million, and $160 million,
    respectively, from the issuance of our common stock through
    employee stock plans.



In fiscal 2007, we repaid the entire balance of
    $520 million related to the Veritas 0.25% Convertible
    Subordinated Notes and in fiscal 2006, we repaid the entire
    balance of a short-term loan with a principal amount of
    EURO 411 million that we assumed in connection with
    our acquisition of Veritas.

Contractual
    Obligations

The contractual obligations presented in the table below
    represent our estimates of future payments under fixed
    contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business
    needs, cancellation provisions, interest rates, and other
    factors may result in actual payments differing from these
    estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and
    amounts of payments related to the contractual obligations set
    forth in the table below. The following table summarizes our
    fixed contractual obligations and commitments as of
    March 31, 2007:

Purchase
    price adjustment

On December 1, 2006, we completed our acquisition of
    Company-i Limited for $26 million in cash. The purchase
    price may be increased by up to $11 million in cash if
    Company-i meets certain billings targets by September 30,
    2008. Payments of the additional consideration may be
    accelerated if certain billings targets are met by
    March 31, 2007 or September 30, 2007. Under the terms
    of the purchase agreement, Symantec has 90 days from the
    respective dates to determine whether the billings target for
    payment of the additional consideration has been met. Any
    increase in the purchase consideration would result in a
    corresponding increase in goodwill. We believe that it is not
    determinable beyond a reasonable doubt that the billing targets
    are met as of March 31, 2007 and therefore we have not
    booked an adjustment in accordance with SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations.

Development
    agreements

During fiscal 2006, we entered into agreements in connection
    with the construction of, or refurbishments to, buildings in
    Springfield, Oregon, and Culver City, California. Payment is
    contingent upon the achievement of certain

agreed-upon

milestones. The remaining commitment under the Culver City,
    California agreement is $91 million as of March 31,
    2007. As of March 31, 2007, the Springfield, Oregon project
    had been completed and there were no remaining commitments under
    that agreement.

Royalties

We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment
    and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally
    based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of
    underlying revenue. Certain



royalty commitments have minimum commitment obligations;
    however, as of March 31, 2007 all such obligations are
    insignificant.

Indemnification

As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we
    indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or
    occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at
    our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of
    future payments we could be required to make under these
    indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have
    directors and officers insurance coverage that reduces our
    exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future
    amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these
    indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance
    coverage is minimal.

We provide limited product warranties and the majority of our
    software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify
    licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from
    claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual
    property rights of a third party. Historically, payments made
    under these provisions have been insignificant. We monitor the
    conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a
    loss has occurred.

Newly
    Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Recent
    accounting pronouncements

In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
    FASB, issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option
    for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an
    amendment of SFAS No. 115.

SFAS No. 159
    permits companies to choose to measure certain financial
    instruments and certain other items at fair value and requires
    unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value
    option has been elected to be reported in earnings.
    SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007. We are currently in the process of
    evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 159 on our
    consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements.

SFAS No. 157
    establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets
    and liabilities. This framework is intended to provide increased
    consistency in how fair value determinations are made under
    various existing accounting standards which permit, or in some
    cases require, estimates of fair market value.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those
    fiscal years. Earlier application is encouraged, provided that
    the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for
    that fiscal year, including any financial statements for an
    interim period within that fiscal year. We are currently in the
    process of evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on
    our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force
    Issue, or EITF,

No. 06-1,

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Service Provider to a
    Manufacturer or Reseller of Equipment Necessary for an
    End-Customer to Receive Service from the Service Provider.

EITF

No. 06-1

requires that we provide disclosures regarding the nature of
    arrangements in which we provide consideration to manufacturers
    or resellers of equipment necessary for an end-customer to
    receive service from us, including the amounts recognized in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income. EITF

06-1

is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2007.
    We do not expect the adoption of EITF

No. 06-1

to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    statements.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109.

The interpretation contains a
    two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax
    positions accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109. The first step is to evaluate the tax
    position for recognition by determining if the weight of
    available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not
    that the position will be sustained on audit, including
    resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
    The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest
    amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon
    ultimate settlement. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently in the
    process of evaluating the impact of FIN 48 on our
    consolidated financial statements.

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments

,
    which amends SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, and
    SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities.

SFAS No. 155



simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in
    other financial instruments by allowing them to be accounted for
    as a whole if the holder elects to account for the entire
    instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS No. 155 also
    clarifies and amends certain other provisions of
    SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140.
    SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial
    instruments acquired, issued, or subject to a re-measurement
    event occurring in fiscal years beginning after
    September 15, 2006. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided
    the company has not yet issued financial statements, including
    for interim periods, for that fiscal year. We do not expect the
    adoption of SFAS No. 155 to have a material impact on
    our consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations
    in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity
    prices. We may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate
    certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign
    exchange policies. We do not use derivatives or other financial
    instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our
    short-term investment portfolio and the potential losses arising
    from changes in interest rates. Our investment objective is to
    achieve the maximum return compatible with capital preservation
    and liquidity requirements. Our strategy is to invest our cash
    in a manner that preserves capital, maintains sufficient
    liquidity to meet the cash requirements of the company,
    maximizes yields consistent with approved credit risk, and
    limits inappropriate concentrations of investment by sector,
    credit, or issuer. We classify our cash equivalents and
    short-term investments in accordance with
    SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in
    Debt and Equity Securities.

We consider investments in
    instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days
    or less to be cash equivalents. We classify our short-term
    investments as

available-for-sale,

and short-term investments consist of marketable debt or equity
    securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days.
    Our cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolios
    consist primarily of money market funds, commercial paper,
    corporate debt securities, asset-backed debt securities, and
    U.S. government and government-sponsored debt securities.
    Our short-term investments do not include equity investments in
    privately held companies. Our short-term investments are
    reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of
    tax, included in Accumulated other comprehensive income within
    Stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments,
    realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be

other-than-temporary

on

available-for-sale

securities are included in Other income (expense), net in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income. We use the specific
    identification method to determine cost in calculating realized
    gains and losses upon sale of short-term investments.

The following table presents the fair value and hypothetical
    changes in fair values on short-term investments sensitive to
    changes in interest rates (in millions):

    rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel
    shifts in the yield curve of plus 150 bps, plus
    100 bps, plus 50 bps, minus 25 bps, and minus
    75 bps.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We conduct business in 38 currencies through our worldwide
    operations and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency
    exposure risk. Foreign currency risks are associated with our
    cash and cash equivalents, investments, receivables, and
    payables denominated in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in
    exchange rates will result in foreign exchange gains and losses
    on these foreign currency assets and liabilities and are
    included in Other



income (expense), net. Our objective in managing foreign
    exchange activity is to preserve stockholder value by minimizing
    the risk of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Our strategy
    is to primarily utilize forward contracts to hedge foreign
    currency exposures. Under our program, gains and losses in our
    foreign currency exposures are offset by losses and gains on our
    forward contracts. Our forward contracts generally have terms of
    35 days or less. At the end of the reporting period, open
    contracts are

marked-to-market

with unrealized gains and losses included in Other income
    (expense), net.

The following table presents a sensitivity analysis on our
    foreign forward exchange contract portfolio using a statistical
    model to estimate the potential gain or loss in fair value that
    could arise from hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of

Equity
    Price Risk

In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion principal amount of
    0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 and
    $1.0 billion of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due
    2013. Holders may convert their Senior Notes prior to maturity
    upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion,
    we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number
    of shares of Symantec common stock, up to the principal amount
    of the note. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any,
    may be paid in cash or in stock at our option. Concurrent with
    the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered into convertible
    note hedge transactions and separately, warrant transactions, to
    reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the Senior
    Notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may
    have on the price of our common stock.

For business and strategic purposes, we also hold equity
    interests in several privately held companies, many of which can
    be considered to be in the

start-up

or
    development stages. These investments are inherently risky and
    we could lose a substantial part or our entire investment in
    these companies. These investments are recorded at cost and
    classified as Other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. As of March 31, 2007, these investments had an
    aggregate carrying value of $8 million.

Controls
    and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The SEC defines the term “disclosure controls and
    procedures” to mean a company’s controls and other
    procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
    to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under
    the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and
    reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms. “Disclosure controls and procedures”
    include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in
    the reports that it files or submits under



the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
    issuer’s management, including its principal executive and
    principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
    functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
    Financial Officer have concluded, based on an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures by our
    management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, that our disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective for the purpose described
    above as of the end of the period covered by this report.

(b)

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) for Symantec.
    Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an
    evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting as of March 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO).

Our management has concluded that, as of the March 31,
    2007, our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective based on these criteria. Our independent registered
    public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued a report on our
    assessment of our internal control over financial reporting,
    which is included herein.

(c)

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

Our annual report on

Form 10-K

for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 disclosed a
    material weakness relating to accounting for income taxes. In
    order to remediate this material weakness, during the first
    three quarters of fiscal 2007, we:

•

Completed our restructuring of personnel dedicated to financial
    reporting for income taxes;

•

More specifically defined existing key controls, and developed
    additional controls, applicable to our interim accounting for
    income taxes;

•

Automated certain elements of our processes to enhance the
    analysis and calculation of the income tax provision and the
    reconciliation of the tax accounts;

•

Enhanced the documentation regarding conclusions reached in the
    implementation of generally accepted accounting
    principles; and

•

Added additional levels of review by qualified personnel of the
    application of each key control.

As a result of these actions, management has concluded that
    Symantec has remediated the material weakness as of
    March 31, 2007. Although certain steps were taken in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 to address the material weakness
    relating to accounting for income taxes, there were no changes
    in Symantec’s internal control over financial reporting
    during the quarter ended March 31, 2007 that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, Symantec’s internal control over financial
    reporting.

(d)

Limitations
    on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors
    and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
    and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
    assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
    Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
    that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
    controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of
    the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
    of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
    issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Symantec have been
    detected.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Symantec Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    March 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended March 31, 2007. In connection
    with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we
    have also audited the related financial statement schedule
    listed in Item 15. These consolidated financial statements
    and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
    statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    March 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended March 31, 2007, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,
    immediately preceding note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective April 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

, and Securities and
    Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
    C

onsidering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
    Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial
    Statements

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of March 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
    dated May 23, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of,
    internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Symantec Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting appearing in Item 9A(b) that Symantec Corporation
    and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2007,
    based on criteria established in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Symantec
    Corporation and subsidiaries maintained effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2007, is
    fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our
    opinion, Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in
    all material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of March 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Symantec Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of March 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended March 31, 2007, and our report
    dated May 23, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    those consolidated financial statements.

SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Symantec Corporation (“we,” “us,” and
    “our” refer to Symantec Corporation and all of its
    subsidiaries) is a global leader in infrastructure software,
    enabling businesses and consumers to have confidence in a
    connected world. We help our customers protect their
    infrastructure, information, and interactions by delivering
    software and services that address risks to information
    security, availability, compliance, and information technology,
    or IT, systems performance. We strive to help our customers
    manage compliance, complexity, and cost by protecting their IT
    infrastructure as they seek to maximize value from their IT
    investments. We deliver a comprehensive and diverse set of
    security and availability products and services to a wide range
    of customers, including large enterprises, governments, small
    and medium-sized businesses, and consumers. Our delivery network
    includes direct, inside, and channel sales resources which
    support our ecosystem of more than 50,000 partners across the
    world, as well as various relationships with original equipment
    manufacturers, or OEMs, Internet service providers, or ISPs, and
    retail and online stores. Founded in 1982, we have operations in
    40 countries.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of Symantec Corporation and its wholly-owned
    subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated.

Acquisitions
    and Divestitures

In fiscal 2007, we acquired two privately-held companies. Each
    of these was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, each
    acquired company’s operating results have been included in
    our consolidated financial statements since its respective date
    of acquisition. During fiscal 2006, we completed our acquisition
    of Veritas Software Corporation, or Veritas, a leading provider
    of software and services to enable storage and backup. The
    results of operations of Veritas have been included in our
    results of operations beginning on July 2, 2005, the
    acquisition date. In addition, in fiscal 2006, we acquired five
    privately-held companies and one public company. In fiscal 2005,
    we acquired five privately-held companies. Each of these
    acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly,
    each acquired company’s operating results have been
    included in our consolidated financial statements since its
    respective date of acquisition.

Fiscal
    Years

We have a

52/53-week

fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references as of and
    for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005
    reflect amounts as of and for the periods ended March 30,
    2007, March 31, 2006, and April 1, 2005, respectively,
    each of which consisted of 52 weeks. The fiscal accounting
    year ending March 28, 2008 will comprise 52 weeks of
    operations.

Symantec share and per share amounts in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income and the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements reflect the

two-for-one

stock split effected as a stock dividend, which occurred on
    November 30, 2004.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates. Significant items subject to such
    estimates and assumptions include those related to the
    allocation of revenues between recognized and deferred amounts,
    the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets, the
    valuation of stock-based compensation, and the valuation
    allowance for deferred income taxes.



Foreign
    Currency Translation

The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally
    the local currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in
    foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate on the
    balance sheet dates. The translation adjustments resulting from
    this process are included as a component of Stockholders’
    equity in Accumulated other comprehensive income. Revenues and
    expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates
    prevailing during the year. Foreign currency transaction gains
    and losses are included in Other income (expense), net in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred tax assets
    (liabilities) are established on the cumulative translation
    adjustment attributable to unremitted foreign earnings that are
    not intended to be indefinitely reinvested.

Revenue
    Recognition

We market and distribute our software products both as
    stand-alone software products and as integrated product suites.
    We recognize revenue when the following conditions have been met:

•

Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists

•

Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered

•

Collection of a fixed or determinable amount is considered
    probable

If we determine that any one of the three criteria is not met,
    we will defer recognition of revenue until all the criteria are
    met.

We derive revenue primarily from sales of content,
    subscriptions, and maintenance and licenses. We present revenue
    net of sales taxes and any similar assessments.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue includes
    arrangements for software maintenance and technical support for
    our products, content and subscription services primarily
    related to our security products, revenue from arrangements
    where vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of the fair
    value of undelivered elements does not exist, and managed
    security services. These arrangements are generally offered to
    our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize
    the related revenue ratably over the maintenance, subscription,
    or service period.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue also includes
    professional services revenue, which consists primarily of the
    fees we earn related to consulting and educational services. We
    generally recognize revenue from professional services as the
    services are performed or upon written acceptance from
    customers, if applicable, assuming all other conditions for
    revenue recognition noted above have been met.

License revenue is derived primarily from the licensing of our
    various products and technology. We generally recognize license
    revenue upon delivery of the product, assuming all other
    conditions for revenue recognition noted above have been met.

We enter into perpetual software license agreements through
    direct sales to customers and indirect sales with distributors
    and resellers. The license agreements generally include product
    maintenance agreements, for which the related revenue is
    included with Content, subscriptions, and maintenance and is
    deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the
    agreements.

In arrangements that include multiple elements, including
    perpetual software licenses and maintenance

and/or

services and packaged products with content updates, we allocate
    and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on VSOE of
    fair value of the undelivered elements, and recognize the
    difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount
    deferred for the undelivered items as license revenue. VSOE of
    each element is based on the price for which the undelivered
    element is sold separately. We determine fair value of the
    undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our
    stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the
    stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements. When VSOE does
    not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance, the entire
    arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance
    period. Our deferred revenue consists primarily of the
    unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance and
    consumer product content update subscriptions and arrangements
    where VSOE does not exist.



Indirect
    channel sales

For our Consumer Products segment, we sell packaged software
    products through a multi-tiered distribution channel. We also
    sell electronic download and packaged products via the Internet.
    We separately sell annual content update subscriptions directly
    to end-users primarily via the Internet. As a result of
    increases in subscription pricing for our consumer products that
    include content updates, we recognize revenue for these products
    ratably over the term of the subscription upon sell-through to
    end-users. For most other consumer products, we recognize
    package product revenue on distributor and reseller channel
    inventory that is not in excess of specified inventory levels in
    these channels. We offer the right of return of our products
    under various policies and programs with our distributors,
    resellers, and end-user customers. We estimate and record
    reserves for product returns as an offset to revenue. We fully
    reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channel as an
    offset to deferred revenue.

For our Security and Data Management and Data Center Management
    segments, we generally recognize revenue from licensing of
    software products through our indirect sales channel upon
    sell-through or with evidence of an end-user. For licensing of
    our software to OEMs, royalty revenue is recognized when the OEM
    reports the sale of the software products to an end-user
    customer, generally on a quarterly basis. In addition to license
    royalties, some OEMs pay an annual flat fee

and/or

support royalties for the right to sell maintenance and
    technical support to the end-user. We recognize revenue from OEM
    support royalties and fees ratably over the term of the support
    agreement.

We offer channel and end-user rebates for our products. Our
    estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are
    based on distributors’ and resellers’ actual
    performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive
    rebate programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our
    reserves for end-user rebates are estimated based on the terms
    and conditions of the promotional program, actual sales during
    the promotion, amount of actual redemptions received, historical
    redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program,
    and the value of the rebate. We estimate and record reserves for
    channel and end-user rebates as an offset to revenue. For
    consumer products that include content updates, rebates are
    recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the term of the
    subscription.

Cash
    Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

We classify our cash equivalents and short-term investments in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or
    SFAS, No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in
    Debt and Equity Securities.

We consider investments in
    instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days
    or less to be cash equivalents. We classify our short-term
    investments as

available-for-sale,

and short-term investments consist of marketable debt or equity
    securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days.
    Our cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolios
    consist primarily of money market funds, commercial paper,
    corporate debt securities, asset-backed debt securities, and
    U.S. government and government-sponsored debt securities.
    Our short-term investments do not include equity investments in
    privately held companies. Our short-term investments are
    reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of
    tax, included in Accumulated other comprehensive income within
    Stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    The amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments,
    realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be

other-than-temporary

on

available-for-sale

securities are included in Other income (expense), net in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income. We use the specific
    identification method to determine cost in calculating realized
    gains and losses upon sale of short-term investments.

Trade
    Accounts Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
    and are not interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for
    doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible trade
    receivables. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts
    are recorded as General and administrative expenses. We review
    our trade receivables by aging category to identify specific
    customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In
    addition, we maintain an allowance for all other receivables not
    included in the specific reserve by applying specific
    percentages of projected uncollectible receivables to the
    various aging categories. In determining these percentages, we
    analyze our historical collection experience and current
    economic trends. We exercise judgment when determining the
    adequacy of these reserves as we evaluate historical bad debt
    trends, general economic conditions



in the U.S. and internationally, and changes in customer
    financial conditions. We also offset deferred revenue against
    accounts receivable when channel inventories are in excess of
    specified levels and for transactions where collection of a
    receivable is not considered probable.

Equity
    Investments

We have equity investments in privately held companies for
    business and strategic purposes. These investments are included
    in Other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
    are accounted for under the cost method as we do not have
    significant influence over these investees. Under the cost
    method, the investment is recorded at its initial cost and is
    periodically evaluated for impairment. During our review for
    impairment, we examine the investees’ actual and forecasted
    operating results, financial position, and liquidity, as well as
    business/industry factors in assessing whether a decline in
    value of an equity investment has occurred that is

other-than-temporary.

When such a decline in value is identified, the fair value of
    the equity investment is estimated based on the preceding
    factors and an impairment loss is recognized in Other income
    (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In
    fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, we recognized impairment losses on
    our equity investments of $3 million, $4 million, and
    an insignificant amount, respectively.

Each quarter we assess our compliance with accounting guidance,
    including the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    Interpretation No., or FIN, 46R,

Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities — An Interpretation of ARB
    No. 51.

Under FIN 46R, we must consolidate a
    variable interest entity if we have a variable interest (or
    combination of variable interests) in the entity that will
    absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receive
    a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or
    both. Currently, our equity investments are not subject to
    consolidation under FIN 46R.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

We utilize some natural hedging to mitigate our foreign currency
    exposures and we manage certain residual exposures through the
    use of one-month forward foreign exchange contracts. We enter
    into forward foreign exchange contracts with high-quality
    financial institutions primarily to minimize currency exchange
    risks associated with certain balance sheet positions
    denominated in foreign currencies. We do not utilize derivative
    instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Gains and
    losses on the contracts are included in Other income (expense),
    net in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the period that
    gains and losses on the underlying maturing forward transactions
    are recognized. The gains and losses on the contracts generally
    offset the gains and losses on the underlying transactions.
    Changes in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts
    are included in earnings. We do not hedge our foreign currency
    translation risk.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
    principally determined using the

first-in,

first-out method. Inventory predominantly consists of finished
    goods as well as deferred costs of revenue. Deferred costs of
    revenue were $40 million at March 31, 2007 and
    $41 million at March 31, 2006, of which
    $27 million and $29 million, respectively, are related
    to consumer products that include content updates and will be
    recognized ratably over the term of the subscription.

Property,
    Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements

Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements are stated at
    cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.
    Depreciation and amortization is provided on a straight-line
    basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets
    as follows:

•

Computer hardware and software — two to five years

•

Office furniture and equipment — three to five years

•

Leasehold improvements — the shorter of the lease term
    or seven years

•

Buildings — twenty-five to thirty years



Capitalized
    Software Development Costs

Costs incurred in connection with the development of software
    products are accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS No. 86,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer
    Software to Be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
    Marketed.

Development costs incurred in the
    research and development of new software products and
    enhancements to existing software products are expensed as
    incurred until technological feasibility in the form of a
    working model has been established. Our software has been
    available for general release concurrent with the establishment
    of technological feasibility, and accordingly no software
    development costs have been capitalized in fiscal 2007, 2006,
    and 2005.

Acquired
    Product Rights

Acquired product rights are comprised of purchased product
    rights, technologies, databases, patents, and contracts from
    acquired companies. Acquired product rights are stated at cost
    less accumulated amortization. Amortization of acquired product
    rights is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated
    useful lives of the respective assets, generally one to eight
    years, and is included in Cost of revenues in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in
    accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets.

SFAS No. 142 requires that
    goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite
    useful lives be tested for impairment at least annually, or more
    frequently if events and circumstances warrant. We evaluate
    goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of
    our reporting units, which are the same as our operating
    segments, to its carrying value, including the goodwill
    allocated to that reporting unit. To determine the reporting
    units’ fair values in the current year evaluation, we used
    the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of
    each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future
    cash flows of that unit. Our cash flow assumptions are based on
    historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs, and other
    relevant factors. SFAS No. 142 also requires that
    intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized over
    their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for
    impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets.

Long-Lived
    Assets

We account for long-lived assets in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144, which requires that long-lived and
    intangible assets, including Property and equipment, net,
    Acquired product rights, net, and Other intangible assets, net
    be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
    not be recoverable. We would recognize an impairment loss when
    the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to
    result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is
    less than its carrying amount. Such impairment loss would be
    measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the
    asset and its fair value, which would be estimated based on the
    discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
    Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets and reported at the lower of the
    carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and no longer
    depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group
    classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the
    appropriate asset and liability sections of the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets.

Income
    Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes.

The
    provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and
    liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for
    operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in each jurisdiction
    in which we operate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to
    taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets
    are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation
    allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is
    believed more likely than not to be realized.



We are required to compute our income taxes in each federal,
    state, and international jurisdiction in which we operate. This
    process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as
    well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and
    tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as
    accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax
    purposes. The income tax effects of the differences we identify
    are classified as current or long-term deferred tax assets and
    liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our judgments,
    assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for
    income tax take into account current tax laws, our
    interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of
    current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax
    authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax
    laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could
    significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of
    Income. We must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax
    assets will be realized from future taxable income and, based on
    this assessment, establish a valuation allowance, if required.
    Our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a
    number of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including
    forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and the relative
    proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various
    domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate.
    The valuation allowance provided significantly relates to
    acquired attributes and therefore any future benefit of the
    realization of the deferred tax assets subject to this valuation
    allowance will be credited to goodwill. To the extent we
    establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation
    allowance in a future period, we reflect the change with a
    corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our
    Consolidated Statements of Income, or to goodwill to the extent
    that the valuation allowance related to tax attributes of the
    acquired entities.

Net
    Income Per Share

Net income per share — basic and diluted are presented
    in conformity with SFAS No. 128,

Earnings per
    Share

, for all periods presented. Net income per
    share — basic is computed using the weighted-average
    number of common shares outstanding during the periods. Net
    income per share — diluted is computed using the
    weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and
    potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the
    periods. Potentially dilutive common shares include the assumed
    exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method, the
    dilutive impact of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and
    warrants using the treasury stock method, and conversion of
    debt, if dilutive in the period. Potentially dilutive common
    shares are excluded in net loss periods, as their effect would
    be antidilutive.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Prior to April 1, 2006, we accounted for stock-based
    compensation awards to employees using the intrinsic value
    method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion,
    or APB, No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees

, and to non-employees using the fair value method
    in accordance with SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation.

In addition, we applied applicable
    provisions of FIN 44,

Accounting for Certain
    Transactions Involving Stock Compensation

, an interpretation
    of APB No. 25.

Effective April 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

, which
    replaced SFAS No. 123 and superseded APB No. 25
    and related interpretations. Under SFAS No. 123R, we
    must measure the fair value of all stock-based awards, including
    stock options, restricted stock units, and employee stock
    purchase plan purchase rights, on the date of grant and amortize
    the fair value of the award to compensation expense over the
    requisite service period. We elected the modified prospective
    application method, under which prior periods are not revised
    for comparative purposes. The valuation provisions of
    SFAS No. 123R apply to new awards and to awards
    outstanding as of the effective date that are subsequently
    modified. For stock-based awards granted on or after
    April 1, 2006, we recognize stock-based compensation
    expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
    period, which is generally the vesting period. We recognize
    estimated compensation expense for stock-based awards that were
    outstanding and unvested as of the effective date on a
    straight-line basis over the remaining service period under the
    pro forma provisions of SFAS No. 123.

As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123R, our Net income
    per share — basic and Net income per share —
    diluted are each $0.12 lower in fiscal 2007 than if we had
    continued to account for stock-based compensation under APB
    No. 25.



Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we presented
    all tax benefits for deductions related to stock options as
    operating cash flows in our Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires cash flows resulting
    from the tax benefits for tax deductions in excess of the
    compensation expense recorded for exercised options to be
    classified as financing cash flows. Accordingly, we classified
    $26 million of such excess tax benefits as financing cash
    flows rather than operating cash flows in our Consolidated
    Statement of Cash Flows for the fiscal year ended March 31,
    2007.

Pursuant to the income tax guidance included in
    SFAS No. 123R, we have elected the regular method of
    computing the pool of excess tax benefits, or APIC pool.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

A significant portion of our revenues and net income is derived
    from international sales and independent agents and
    distributors. Fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against
    foreign currencies, changes in local regulatory or economic
    conditions, piracy, or nonperformance by independent agents or
    distributors could adversely affect operating results.

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and
    cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade accounts
    receivable, and forward foreign exchange contracts. Our
    investment portfolio is diversified and consists of investment
    grade securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of
    credit risk exposure to any one issuer and in any one country.
    We are exposed to credit risks in the event of default by the
    issuers to the extent of the amount recorded in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. The credit risk in our trade accounts receivable
    is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process,
    reasonably short collection terms, and the geographical
    dispersion of sales transactions. We maintain reserves for
    potential credit losses and such losses have been within
    management’s expectations.

Legal
    Expenses

Prior to October 1, 2006, we recognized a liability for
    cases where we are the defendant for estimated external legal
    costs to be incurred during the next fiscal quarter. Effective
    October 1, 2006, we changed our policy related to legal
    costs from one generally accepted method of accounting to
    another generally accepted method of accounting. Under our new
    policy, we will no longer recognize a liability for external
    legal costs related to future periods. Instead, we will expense
    such amounts in the period incurred. We believe that this new
    policy is preferable in the circumstances because the costs and
    administrative burden involved in estimating future legal
    expenses outweigh the benefits. Further, we believe that this
    new method more accurately aligns the expense with the
    accounting period in which it is incurred. We will continue to
    accrue amounts related to external legal costs that are incurred
    during the period and to accrue probable losses in the period in
    which the loss is identified. The impact of this change in
    accounting method is inconsequential for all prior periods
    presented, and, therefore, prior periods have not been revised
    to reflect this change.

Accumulated
    Other Comprehensive Income

We report comprehensive income or loss in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 130,

Reporting Comprehensive
    Income,

which establishes standards for reporting
    comprehensive income and its components in the financial
    statements. The components of other comprehensive income consist
    of unrealized gains and losses on

available-for-sale

securities, net of tax, and foreign currency translation
    adjustments, net of tax. Unrealized losses on our

available-for-sale

securities were $2 million and $6 million as of
    March 31, 2007 and 2006 respectively. Comprehensive income
    is presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ Equity and Comprehensive Income.



Adoption
    of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or
    SEC, issued Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
    Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
    Statements.

SAB No. 108 provides guidance on how
    prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when
    quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements
    for purposes of determining whether the current year’s
    financial statements are materially misstated.
    SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending on or
    after November 15, 2006. Historically, we have evaluated
    uncorrected differences utilizing the “rollover”
    approach. The rollover approach quantifies a misstatement based
    on the amount of the error originating in the current year
    income statement. Thus, this approach ignores the effects of
    correcting the portion of the current year balance sheet
    misstatement that originated in prior years (i.e., it ignores
    the “carryover effects” of prior year misstatements).
    We believe that our assessment of uncorrected differences in
    prior periods and the conclusions reached regarding the
    qualitative and quantitative effects of such uncorrected
    differences were appropriate. We adopted SAB No. 108
    in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and elected to record the
    effects of applying SAB No. 108 using the cumulative
    effect transition method which resulted in the correction of the
    carrying values of assets and liabilities as of April 1,
    2006 with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening
    balance of retained earnings. The following table summarizes the
    SAB No. 108 cumulative effect adjustment as of
    April 1, 2006.

Certain of the adjustments ((2) through (6) and (10))
    included above also resulted in errors in the first three
    quarters of fiscal 2007. In conjunction with our adoption of
    SAB No. 108 in the fourth quarter, we noted certain
    other misstatements, the correction of which only impacted
    fiscal 2007. We previously evaluated these misstatements
    utilizing the rollover approach and concluded that these errors
    were insignificant, individually and in the aggregate, to each
    of the first three quarters of fiscal 2007. Our disclosure of
    selected quarterly information included in Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

has been
    adjusted to reflect our adoption of SAB No. 108 as of
    April 1, 2006.

Newly
    Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
    FASB, issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option
    for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an
    amendment of SFAS No. 115.

SFAS No. 159
    permits companies to choose to measure certain financial
    instruments and certain other items at fair value and requires
    unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value
    option has been elected to be reported in earnings.
    SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007. We are currently in the process of
    evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 159 on our
    consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements.

SFAS No. 157
    establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets
    and liabilities. This framework is intended to provide increased
    consistency in how fair value determinations are made under
    various existing accounting standards which permit, or in some
    cases require, estimates of fair market value.
    SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those
    fiscal years. Earlier application is encouraged, provided that
    the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for
    that fiscal year, including any financial statements for an
    interim period within that fiscal year. We are currently in the
    process of evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157 on
    our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force
    Issue, or EITF,

No. 06-1,

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Service Provider to a
    Manufacturer or Reseller of Equipment Necessary for an
    End-Customer to Receive Service from the Service Provider.

EITF

No. 06-1

requires that we provide disclosures regarding the nature of
    arrangements in which we provide consideration to manufacturers
    or resellers of equipment



necessary for an end-customer to receive service from us,
    including the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements
    of Income. EITF

06-1

is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2007.
    We do not expect the adoption of EITF

No. 06-1

to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    statements.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109.

The interpretation contains a
    two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax
    positions accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109. The first step is to evaluate the tax
    position for recognition by determining if the weight of
    available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not
    that the position will be sustained on audit, including
    resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
    The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest
    amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon
    ultimate settlement. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently in the
    process of evaluating the impact of FIN 48 on our
    consolidated financial statements.

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments

,
    which amends SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, and
    SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities.

SFAS No. 155 simplifies the
    accounting for certain derivatives embedded in other financial
    instruments by allowing them to be accounted for as a whole if
    the holder elects to account for the entire instrument on a fair
    value basis. SFAS No. 155 also clarifies and amends
    certain other provisions of SFAS No. 133 and
    SFAS No. 140. SFAS No. 155 is effective for
    all financial instruments acquired, issued, or subject to a
    re-measurement event occurring in fiscal years beginning after
    September 15, 2006. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided
    the company has not yet issued financial statements, including
    for interim periods, for that fiscal year. We do not expect the
    adoption of SFAS No. 155 to have a material impact on
    our consolidated financial statements.

    respectively.

Note 3.

Acquisitions

Fiscal
    2007 acquisitions

On December 1, 2006, we completed our acquisition of
    Company-i Limited, a UK-based professional services firm that
    specialized in addressing key challenges associated with
    operating and managing a data center in the financial services
    industry, for $26 million in cash, including an
    insignificant amount for acquisition related expenses. The
    aggregate purchase price was allocated as follows, based on the
    currency exchange rate on the date of acquisition: goodwill,
    $22 million; other intangible assets, $6 million; net
    deferred tax liabilities, $2 million; and an insignificant
    amount to net tangible assets. Goodwill resulted primarily from
    our expectation of synergies from the integration of
    Company-i’s service offerings with our service offerings.
    The amount allocated to Other intangible assets is being
    amortized to Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements
    of Income over its estimated useful

    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

life of eight years. The results of operations of Company-i have
    been included in our results of operations since its acquisition
    date. The financial results of this acquisition are considered
    insignificant for purposes of pro forma financial disclosures.
    Company-i is included in our Services segment. No goodwill is
    deductible for tax purposes.

In addition, the purchase price may be increased by up to
    $11 million in cash if Company-i meets certain billings
    targets by September 30, 2008. Payments of the additional
    consideration may be accelerated if certain billings targets are
    met by March 31, 2007 or September 30, 2007. Under the
    terms of the purchase agreement, Symantec has 90 days from
    the respective dates to determine whether the billings target
    for payment of the additional consideration has been met. Any
    increase in the purchase consideration would result in a
    corresponding increase in goodwill. We believe that it is not
    determinable beyond a reasonable doubt that the billing target
    are met as of March 31, 2007 and therefore we have not
    booked an adjustment in accordance with SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations.

On February 23, 2007, we completed our acquisition of
    4FrontSecurity, Inc, for approximately $7 million in cash.
    4FrontSecurity developed and distributed governance, risk
    management, and regulatory compliance software that enabled
    companies to measure and manage business and security
    assessments of organizational information. The aggregate
    purchase price was allocated as follows: goodwill,
    $6 million; other intangible assets, $3 million; and
    insignificant amounts to income tax payable and net deferred tax
    liabilities. Goodwill resulted primarily from our expectation of
    synergies from the integration of 4FrontSecurity’s
    technology with our technology. The amount allocated to other
    intangible assets is being amortized to Operating expenses in
    the Consolidated Statements of Income over their estimated lives
    of one to seven years. The results of operations of
    4FrontSecurity have been included in our results of operations
    since its acquisition date. The financial results of this
    acquisition are considered insignificant for purposes of pro
    forma financial disclosures. 4FrontSecurity is included in our
    Security and Data Management segment. No goodwill is deductible
    for tax purposes.

Fiscal
    2006 acquisitions

On July 2, 2005, we completed our acquisition of Veritas, a
    leading provider of software and services to enable storage and
    backup, whereby Veritas became a wholly owned subsidiary of
    Symantec in a transaction accounted for using the purchase
    method of accounting. The total purchase price of
    $13.2 billion includes Symantec common stock valued at
    $12.5 billion, assumed stock options and restricted stock
    units, or RSUs, with a fair value of $699 million, and
    acquisition-related expenses of $39 million. The total
    purchase price of the acquisition is as follows (in thousands):

    Veritas have been included in the Consolidated Statements of
    Income beginning on July 2, 2005 and had a significant
    impact on our revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses.

The Veritas business is included in our Consumer Products,
    Security and Data Management, Data Center Management, and
    Services segments.

Purchase
    price allocation

In accordance with SFAS No. 141, the total purchase

Estimated weighted-average remaining vesting period.

During fiscal 2007, we adjusted goodwill for amounts primarily
    related to tax adjustments, which consisted of adjustments to
    deferred taxes and income taxes payable related to
    pre-acquisition tax contingencies and actual tax benefits
    arising from employee exercises of assumed fully-vested stock
    options. The purchase price allocation may be further adjusted
    in future periods pending resolution of the Veritas
    pre-acquisition income tax matters discussed in Note 13.

Net
    tangible assets

Veritas’ tangible assets and liabilities as of July 2,
    2005 were reviewed and adjusted to their fair value as
    necessary, including a write down in the amount of
    $113 million relating to land owned in various locations.
    Net tangible assets include net deferred tax assets of
    $223 million and income taxes payable of $269 million.

Deferred
    revenue

In connection with the acquisition of Veritas, we assumed
    Veritas’ contractual obligations related to its deferred
    revenue. Veritas’ deferred revenue was derived from
    licenses, maintenance, consulting, education, and other
    services. We estimated our obligation related to the Veritas
    deferred revenue using the cost

build-up

approach. The cost

build-up

approach determines fair value by estimating the costs relating
    to fulfilling the obligation plus a normal profit margin. The
    sum of the costs and operating profit approximates, in theory,
    the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to
    assume the support obligation. The estimated costs to fulfill
    the support obligation were based on the historical direct costs
    related to providing the support. As a result, we recorded an
    adjustment to reduce the carrying value of deferred revenue by
    $359 million to $173 million, which represents our
    estimate of the fair value of the contractual obligations
    assumed.

Identifiable
    intangible assets

Acquired product rights include developed and core technology,
    patents, and backlog. Developed technology relates to
    Veritas’ products across all of their product lines that
    have reached technological feasibility. Core technology and
    patents represent a combination of Veritas processes, patents,
    and trade secrets developed through



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

years of experience in design and development of their products.
    Backlog relates to firm customer orders that generally are
    scheduled for delivery within the next quarter, as well as OEM
    revenues that are reported in the next quarter. We amortized the
    fair value of the backlog to Cost of revenues in the September
    2005 quarter. We are amortizing the fair values of all other
    Acquired product rights to Cost of revenues on a straight-line
    basis over their estimated lives of four to five years.

Customer contracts and relationships represent existing
    contracts that relate primarily to underlying customer
    relationships. We are amortizing the fair values of these assets
    to Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income
    on a straight-line basis over an average estimated life of eight
    years.

Trade names relate to the Veritas product names that will
    continue in use. We are amortizing the fair values of these
    assets to Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of
    Income on a straight- line basis over an estimated life of ten
    years.

Goodwill

Approximately $8.6 billion of the purchase price has been
    allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the
    purchase price over the fair value of the underlying net
    tangible and intangible assets. The goodwill was attributed to
    the premium paid for the opportunity to expand and better serve
    the addressable market and achieve greater long-term growth
    opportunities than either company had operating alone.
    Management believes that the combined company will be better
    positioned to deliver security and availability solutions across
    all platforms, from the desktop to the data center, to customers
    ranging from consumers and small businesses to large
    organizations and service providers. Goodwill recorded as a
    result of this acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill will not be
    amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least
    annually or more frequently if certain indicators are present.
    In the event that management determines that the value of
    goodwill has become impaired, we would incur an accounting
    charge for the amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in
    which the determination is made.

In-process
    research and development (IPR&D)

During fiscal 2006, we wrote off acquired IPR&D totaling
    $284 million in connection with our acquisition of Veritas.
    The IPR&D was written off because the acquired technologies
    had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative
    uses. Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent
    to completion of a beta-phase working prototype in which there
    is no remaining risk relating to the development. At the time of
    the acquisition, Veritas was developing new products in multiple
    product areas that qualified as IPR&D. These efforts
    included NetBackup 6.1, Backup Exec 11.0, Server Management 5.0,
    and various other projects. At the time of the acquisition, it
    was estimated that these IPR&D efforts would be completed
    over the following 12 to 18 months at an estimated total
    cost of $120 million. As of March 31, 2007, the
    majority of all IPR&D projects had been completed on
    schedule and within expected costs, except for one small project
    which is expected to be completed within the next six months.

The value assigned to IPR&D was determined by estimating
    costs to develop the purchased IPR&D into commercially
    viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from
    the projects when completed, and discounting the net cash flows
    to their present value. The revenue estimates used in the net
    cash flow forecasts were based on estimates of relevant market
    sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology, and the
    nature and expected timing of new product introductions by
    Veritas and its competitors.

The rate utilized to discount the net cash flows to their
    present value was based on Veritas’ weighted-average cost
    of capital. The weighted-average cost of capital was adjusted to
    reflect the difficulties and uncertainties in completing each
    project and thereby achieving technological feasibility, the
    percentage of completion of each project, anticipated market
    acceptance and penetration, market growth rates, and risks
    related to the impact of



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

potential changes in future target markets. Based on these
    factors, a discount rate of 13.5% was deemed appropriate for
    valuing the IPR&D.

The estimates used in valuing IPR&D were based upon
    assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently
    uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or
    inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur.

Other
    fiscal 2006 acquisitions

During fiscal 2006, in addition to Veritas, we completed
    acquisitions of five privately-held companies and one public
    company for an aggregate of $627 million in cash, including
    acquisition-related expenses resulting from financial advisory,
    legal and accounting services, duplicate sites, and severance
    costs of approximately $18 million, of which an
    insignificant amount remains as an accrual as of March 31,
    2007. We recorded goodwill in connection with each of these
    acquisitions. In each acquisition, goodwill resulted primarily
    from our expectation of synergies from the integration of the
    acquired company’s technology with our technology and the
    acquired company’s access to our global distribution
    network. In addition, each acquired company provided a
    knowledgeable and experienced workforce. The results of
    operations for the acquired companies have been included in our
    results of operations since their respective acquisition dates.

    to our reporting units, which are the same as our operating
    segments. Goodwill is allocated as follows:

(a)

In the June 2006 quarter, we consolidated our Enterprise
    Security, Data Protection, and Storage and Server Management
    segments into two segments — the Security and Data
    Management segment and the Data Center Management segment. We
    changed our reportable segments to the following: Consumer
    Products, Security and Data Management, Data Center Management,
    Services and Other. As a result, we reallocated goodwill as of
    March 31, 2006. In conjunction with the reallocation of our
    segments, we determined that there were no indicators of
    impairment.

(b)

During fiscal 2007, we adjusted the goodwill related to several
    prior acquisitions for individually insignificant amounts
    primarily related to purchase consideration adjustments for cash
    received and adjustments related to taxes. The tax adjustments
    consist of adjustments to increase deferred tax liabilities by
    approximately $12 million and decrease income taxes payable
    by approximately $12 million related to pre-acquisition tax
    contingencies and actual tax benefits arising from employee
    exercises of assumed fully-vested stock options.

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or earlier
    if indicators of impairment exist. We completed our annual
    goodwill impairment test required by SFAS No. 142
    during the March 2007 quarter and determined that there was no
    impairment of goodwill.

On May 12, 2005, we resolved patent litigation matters with
    Altiris, Inc. by entering into a cross-licensing agreement that
    resolved all legal claims between the companies. As part of the
    settlement, we paid Altiris $10 million for use of the
    disputed technology. Under the transaction, we expensed
    $2 million of patent settlement costs in the June 2005
    quarter that was related to benefits received by us in and prior
    to the June 2005 quarter. The remaining $8 million was
    recorded as Acquired product rights and is being amortized to
    Cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income over
    the remaining life of the primary patent, which expires in May
    2017. In April 2007, we acquired Altiris. See Note 17 for
    more information.

In fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, amortization expense for
    acquired product rights was $342 million,
    $314 million, and $49 million, respectively.
    Amortization of acquired product rights is included in Cost of
    revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The
    weighted-average remaining estimated lives of acquired product
    rights are approximately three years for developed technology
    and approximately four years for patents. The weighted-average
    remaining estimated life of acquired product rights in total is
    approximately four years. Annual amortization of acquired
    product rights, based upon our existing acquired product rights
    and their current useful lives, is estimated to be the following
    as of March 31, 2007:

In fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, amortization expense for other
    intangible assets was $201 million, $149 million, and
    $5 million, respectively. Amortization of other intangible
    assets is included in Operating expenses in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income. The weighted-average remaining estimated
    lives for other intangible assets are approximately six years
    for customer base, approximately eight years for trade name, and
    approximately one year for partnership agreements. The
    weighted-average remaining estimated life of other intangible
    assets in total is approximately eight years. Annual
    amortization of other intangible assets, based upon our existing
    intangible assets and their current estimated lives, is

Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

As of March 31, 2007, the unrealized losses in the above
    table relate to short-term investment securities for which the
    fair value is less than the cost basis. We expect to receive the
    full principal and interest on these securities. When evaluating
    our investments for possible impairment, we review factors such
    as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been
    below cost basis, credit quality, the financial condition of the
    investee, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for
    a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated
    recovery in market value. The gross unrealized losses related to
    investments are primarily due to a decrease in the fair market
    value of fixed-rate debt securities as a result of increases in
    interest rates. The changes in the values in the above
    securities are considered to be temporary in nature and,
    accordingly, we do not believe that the values of these
    securities are impaired as of March 31, 2007. Unrealized
    gains and losses on

available-for-sale

securities are reported as a component of Stockholders’
    equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognized net
    realized losses of an insignificant amount in fiscal 2007,
    $5 million in fiscal 2006, and an insignificant amount in
    fiscal 2005. These net realized losses were included in Interest
    income.

Equity
    investments in privately-held companies

As of March 31, 2007 and 2006, we held equity investments
    with a carrying value of $8 million and $11 million,
    respectively, in several privately-held companies. These
    investments are recorded at cost as we do not have significant
    influence over the investees and are included in Other long-term
    assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We regularly review
    our equity investment portfolio according to EITF

No. 03-1,

The Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.

We
    identify and evaluate equity investments that have indications
    of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining
    whether a loss is temporary include: the length of time and
    extent to which the fair market value has been lower than the
    cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of
    the investee, credit quality, and our ability to hold the
    investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any
    anticipated recovery in fair market value. In fiscal 2007, 2006
    and 2005, we recognized declines in value of these investments
    that were determined to be

Debt

Convertible
    senior notes

In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion principal amount of
    0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2011, or
    the 0.75% Notes, and $1.0 billion principal amount of
    1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2013, or
    the 1.00% Notes, to initial purchasers in a private
    offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant
    to SEC Rule 144A. We refer to the 0.75% Notes and the
    1.00% Notes collectively as the Senior Notes. We received
    proceeds of $2.1 billion from the Senior Notes and incurred
    net transaction costs of approximately $33 million, which
    were allocated proportionately to the 0.75% Notes and the
    1.00% Notes. The transaction costs were primarily recorded
    in Other long-term assets and are being amortized to interest
    expense using the effective interest method over five years for
    the 0.75% Notes and seven years for the 1.00% Notes.
    The 0.75% Notes and 1.00% Notes were each issued at
    par and bear interest at 0.75% and 1.00% per annum,
    respectively. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on
    June 15 and December 15, beginning December 15, 2006.

Each $1,000 of principal of the Senior Notes will initially be
    convertible into 52.2951 shares of Symantec common stock,
    which is the equivalent of $19.12 per share, subject to
    adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of
    the Senior Notes may convert their Senior Notes prior to
    maturity during specified periods as follows: (1) during
    any calendar quarter beginning after June 30, 2006, if the
    closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days
    in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
    day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than
    130% of the applicable conversion price per share; (2) if
    specified corporate transactions, including a change in control,
    occur; (3) with respect to the 0.75% Notes, at any
    time on or after April 5, 2011, and with respect to the
    1.00% Notes, at any time on or after April 5, 2013; or
    (4) during the five

business-day

period after any five consecutive

trading-day

period during which the trading price of the Senior Notes falls
    below a certain threshold. Upon conversion, we would pay the
    holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of
    Symantec common stock, up to the principal amount of the note.
    Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid
    in cash or in stock at our option. Holders who convert their
    Senior Notes in connection with a change in control may be
    entitled to a “make whole” premium in the form of an
    increase in the conversion rate. As of March 31, 2007, none
    of the conditions allowing holders of the Senior Notes to
    convert had been met. In addition, upon a change in control of
    Symantec, the holders of the Senior Notes may require us to
    repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Senior Notes for
    100% of the principal amount.

Under the terms of the Senior Notes, we were required to use
    reasonable efforts to file a shelf registration statement
    regarding the Senior Notes with the SEC and cause the shelf
    registration statement to be declared effective within
    180 days of the closing of the offering of the Senior
    Notes. In addition, we must maintain the effectiveness of the
    shelf registration statement for a period of two years after the
    closing of the offering of the Senior Notes. If we fail to meet
    these terms, we will be required to pay additional interest on
    the Senior Notes in the amount of 0.25% per annum. We have
    filed the shelf registration statement with the SEC and it
    became effective on December 11, 2006.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered
    into note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain of the
    initial purchasers whereby we have the option to purchase up to
    110 million shares of our common stock at a price of
    $19.12 per share. The options as to 58 million shares
    expire on June 15, 2011 and the options as to
    52 million shares expire on June 15, 2013. The options
    must be settled in net shares. The cost of the note hedge
    transactions to us was approximately $592 million. In
    addition, we sold warrants to affiliates of certain of the
    initial purchasers whereby they have the option to purchase up
    to 110 million shares of our common stock at a price of
    $27.3175 per share. The warrants expire on various dates from
    July 2011 through August 2013 and must be settled in net shares.
    We received approximately $326 million in cash proceeds
    from the sale of these warrants.



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The cost incurred in connection with the note hedge
    transactions, net of the related tax benefit and the proceeds
    from the sale of the warrants, is included as a net reduction in
    Capital in excess of par value in the accompanying Consolidated
    Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2007, in accordance with the
    guidance in EITF

No. 00-19,

Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to,
    and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock.

In accordance with SFAS No. 128,

Earnings per
    Share

, the Senior Notes will have no impact on diluted
    earnings per share, or EPS, until the price of our common stock
    exceeds the conversion price of $19.12 per share because
    the principal amount of the Senior Notes will be settled in cash
    upon conversion. Prior to conversion we will include the effect
    of the additional shares that may be issued if our common stock
    price exceeds $19.12 per share using the treasury stock
    method. As a result, for the first $1.00 by which the price of
    our common stock exceeds $19.12 per share there would be
    dilution of approximately 5.4 million shares. As the share
    price continues to increase, additional dilution would occur at
    a declining rate such that a price of $27.3175 per share
    would yield cumulative dilution of approximately
    32.9 million shares. If our common stock exceeds
    $27.3175 per share we will also include the effect of the
    additional potential shares that may be issued related to the
    warrants using the treasury stock method. The Senior Notes along
    with the warrants have a combined dilutive effect such that for
    the first $1.00 by which the price exceeds $27.3175 per
    share there would be cumulative dilution of approximately
    39.5 million shares prior to conversion. As the share price
    continues to increase, additional dilution would occur but at a
    declining rate.

Prior to conversion, the note hedge transactions are not
    considered for purposes of the EPS calculation as their effect
    would be anti-dilutive. Upon conversion, the note hedge will
    automatically serve to neutralize the dilutive effect of the
    Senior Notes when the stock price is above $19.12 per
    share. For example, if upon conversion the price of our common
    stock was $28.3175 per share, the cumulative effect of
    approximately 39.5 million shares in the example above
    would be reduced to approximately 3.9 million shares.

The preceding calculations assume that the average price of our
    common stock exceeds the respective conversion prices during the
    period for which EPS is calculated and exclude any potential
    adjustments to the conversion ratio provided under the terms of
    the Senior Notes. See Note 9 for information regarding the
    impact on EPS of the Senior Notes and warrants in the current
    period.

Convertible
    subordinated notes

In connection with the acquisition of Veritas Software
    Corporation on July 2, 2005, we assumed the Veritas
    0.25% convertible subordinated notes, or the
    0.25% Notes. On August 1, 2006, at the option of
    certain of the holders, we repurchased $510 million of the
    0.25% Notes at a price equal to the principal amount, plus
    accrued and unpaid interest. On August 28, 2006, at our
    election, we repurchased the remaining $10 million of the
    0.25% Notes at a price equal to the principal amount plus
    accrued and unpaid interest and fully paid off our convertible
    subordinated notes debt obligation.

Line
    of credit

In July 2006, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior
    unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in July 2011.
    Borrowings under the facility will bear interest, at our option,
    at either a rate equal to the bank’s base rate or a rate
    equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on our leverage ratio, as
    defined in the credit facility agreement. In connection with the
    credit facility, we must maintain certain covenants, including a
    specified ratio of debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest,
    taxes, depreciation, and amortization), as well as various other
    non-financial covenants. At March 31, 2007, we were in
    compliance with all covenants. We have made no borrowings under
    the credit facility at March 31, 2007.

    reserve. For more information, see Note 12.

Rent expense charged to operations totaled $83 million,
    $70 million, and $35 million in fiscal 2007, 2006, and
    2005, respectively.

Development
    agreements

During fiscal 2006, we entered into agreements in connection
    with the construction of, or refurbishments to, buildings in
    Springfield, Oregon, and Culver City, California. Payment is
    contingent upon the achievement of certain

agreed-upon

milestones. The remaining commitment under the Culver City,
    California agreement is $91 million as of March 31,
    2007. At March 31, 2007, the Springfield, Oregon project
    had been completed and there were no remaining commitments under
    that agreement.

Royalties

We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment
    and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally
    based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of
    underlying revenue. Certain royalty commitments have minimum
    commitment obligations; however, as of March 31, 2007 all
    such obligations are insignificant.

Indemnification

As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we
    indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or
    occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at
    our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of
    future payments we could be required to make under these
    indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have
    director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our
    exposure and may enable us to recover a portion or all of any
    future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of
    these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable
    insurance coverage is minimal.

We provide limited product warranties and the majority of our

    licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from
    claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual
    property rights of a third party. Historically, payments made
    under these provisions have been insignificant. We monitor the
    conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a

Stock
    repurchases

We have operated stock repurchase programs since 2001. As of
    January 2007, we completed the $1 billion share repurchase
    program announced in January 2006 as well as the
    $1.5 billion share repurchase program announced in June
    2006. On January 24, 2007, we announced that our Board of
    Directors authorized the repurchase of $1 billion of
    Symantec common stock, without a scheduled expiration date.

During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 162 million shares of
    our common stock at prices ranging from $15.61 to
    $21.66 per share for an aggregate amount of
    $2.8 billion. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased
    174 million shares at prices ranging from $15.83 to
    $23.85 per share for an aggregate amount of
    $3.6 billion. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased eight
    million shares at prices ranging from $21.05 to $30.77 per
    share, for an aggregate amount of $192 million. As of
    March 31, 2007, $500 million remained authorized for
    future repurchases.

Stock
    dividend

On October 19, 2004, our Board of Directors approved a

two-for-one

stock split to be effected in the form of a stock dividend.
    Stockholders of record at the close of business on
    November 11, 2004 were issued one additional share of
    common stock for each share owned as of that date. An additional
    353 million shares resulting from the stock dividend were
    issued in book-entry form on November 30, 2004.

Increase
    to authorized shares

On June 24, 2005, our stockholders approved the adoption of
    our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which
    increased the number of authorized shares of common stock to
    3,000,000,000 from 1,600,000,000. The increase was sought in
    order to carry out our acquisition of Veritas. On
    September 15, 2004, our stockholders approved the adoption
    of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which
    increased the number of authorized shares of common stock to
    1,600,000,000 from 900,000,000.

Note 10.

Adoption
    of Stockholder Rights Plan

On August 11, 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a
    stockholder rights plan designed to ensure orderly consideration
    of any future unsolicited acquisition attempt to ensure a fair
    value of Symantec for our stockholders. In connection with the
    plan, the Board of Directors declared and paid a dividend of one
    preferred share purchase right for each share of Symantec common
    stock outstanding on the record date, August 21, 1998. The
    rights are initially attached to Symantec common stock and will
    not trade separately. If a person or a group, an Acquiring
    Person, acquires 20% or more of our common stock, or announces
    an intention to make a tender offer for 20% or more of our
    common stock, the rights will be distributed and will thereafter
    trade separately from the common stock.

If the rights become exercisable, each right (other than rights
    held by the Acquiring Person) will entitle the holder to
    purchase, at a price equal to the exercise price of the right, a
    number of shares of our common stock having a then-current value
    of twice the exercise price of the right. If, after the rights
    become exercisable, we agree to merge into another entity or we
    sell more than 50% of our assets, each right will entitle the
    holder to purchase, at a price equal to the exercise price of
    the right, a number of shares of common stock of such entity
    having a then-current value of twice the exercise price.

We may exchange the rights at a ratio of one share of common
    stock for each right (other than the Acquiring Person) at any
    time after an Acquiring Person acquires 20% or more of our
    common stock but before such person acquires 50% or more of our
    common stock. We may also redeem the rights at our option at a
    price of $0.001 per right at any time before an Acquiring
    Person has acquired 20% or more of our common stock. The rights
    will expire on August 12, 2008.

Note 11.

Employee
    Benefits and Stock-Based Compensation

401(k)
    plan

We maintain a salary deferral 401(k) plan for all of our
    domestic employees. This plan allows employees to contribute up
    to 50% of their pretax salary up to the maximum dollar
    limitation prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. We match 50%
    of the employee’s contribution. The maximum match in any
    given plan year is the lower of 3% of the employees’
    eligible compensation or $6,000. Our contributions under the
    plan were $24 million, $12 million, and
    $9 million, in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Stock
    purchase plans

    Executive Officers’ Stock Purchase Plan

In September 2002, our stockholders approved the 2002 Executive
    Officers’ Stock Purchase Plan and reserved
    250,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder, of
    which no shares are subject to adjustment pursuant to changes in
    capital. The purpose of the plan is to provide executive
    officers with a means to acquire an equity interest in Symantec
    at fair market value by applying a portion or all of their
    respective bonus payments towards the purchase price. Each
    executive officer may purchase up to 10,000 shares in any
    fiscal year. As of March 31, 2007, 40,401 shares have
    been issued under the plan and 209,599 shares remain
    available for future issuance. Shares reserved for issuance
    under this plan have not been adjusted for the stock dividends.

    Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In September 1998, our stockholders approved the 1998 Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, and reserved 4 million shares
    of common stock for issuance thereunder. In September 1999, the
    ESPP was amended by our stockholders to increase the shares
    available for issuance by 6 million and to add an
    “evergreen” provision whereby the number of shares
    available for issuance increased automatically on January 1 of
    each year (beginning in 2000) by 1% of our outstanding
    shares of common stock on each immediately preceding
    December 31 during the term of the



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

ESPP. In July 2004, the Board of Directors eliminated this
    provision. As of March 31, 2007, 14.2 million shares
    remain available for issuance under the ESPP.

Subject to certain limitations, our employees may elect to have
    2% to 10% of their compensation withheld through payroll
    deductions to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP.
    Employees purchase shares of common stock at a price per share
    equal to 85% of the fair market value on the purchase date at
    the end of each six-month purchase period. For purchases prior
    to July 1, 2005, employees purchased shares at a price
    equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value as of the
    beginning of the two-year offering period or the end of the
    six-month purchase period. The Board of Directors eliminated the
    two-year offering period in March 2005, effective July 1,
    2005. Under the ESPP, 4 million, 4 million, and
    3 million shares were issued during fiscal 2007, 2006, and
    2005, respectively, representing $65 million,
    $59 million, and $32 million in contributions,
    respectively. As of March 31, 2007, a total of
    24.4 million shares had been issued under this plan.

Stock
    award plans

2000 Director
    Equity Incentive Plan

In September 2000, our stockholders approved the
    2000 Director Equity Incentive Plan and reserved
    50,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder. In
    September 2004, stockholders increased the number of shares of
    stock that may be issued by 50,000. The purpose of this plan is
    to provide the members of the Board of Directors with an
    opportunity to receive common stock for all or a portion of the
    retainer payable to each director for serving as a member. Each
    director may elect to receive 50% to 100% of the retainer to be
    paid in the form of stock. As of March 31, 2007, a total of
    78,727 shares had been issued under this plan and
    21,273 shares remained available for future issuance.

    Equity Incentive Plan

Under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2004 Plan, our
    Board of Directors, or a committee of the Board of Directors,
    may grant incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock
    appreciation rights, restricted stock units, RSUs, or restricted
    stock awards to employees, officers, directors, consultants,
    independent contractors, and advisors to us, or to any parent,
    subsidiary, or affiliate of ours. The purpose of the 2004 Plan
    is to attract, retain, and motivate eligible persons whose
    present and potential contributions are important to our success
    by offering them an opportunity to participate in our future
    performance through equity awards of stock options and stock
    bonuses. Under the terms of the 2004 Plan, the exercise price of
    stock options may not be less than 100% of the fair market value
    on the date of grant. Options generally vest over a four-year
    period. Options granted prior to October 2005 generally have a
    maximum term of ten years and options granted thereafter
    generally have a maximum term of seven years.

As of March 31, 2007, we have reserved 73 million
    shares for issuance under the 2004 Plan. These shares include
    18 million shares originally reserved for issuance under
    the 2004 Plan upon its adoption by our stockholders in September
    2004, 15 million shares that were transferred to the 2004
    Plan from the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan, or 1996 Plan, and
    40 million shares that were approved for issuance on the
    amendment and restatement of the 2004 Plan at our 2006 annual
    meeting of stockholders. In addition to the shares currently
    reserved under the 2004 Plan, any shares reacquired by us from
    options outstanding under the 1996 Plan upon their expiration
    will also be added to the 2004 Plan reserve. As of
    March 31, 2007, 52 million shares remain available for
    future grant under the 2004 Plan.

At our 2006 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders
    approved the amendment and restatement of the 2004 Plan, which
    included the following key changes: 1) an increase of
    40 million in the number of shares reserved for issuance
    under the 2004 Plan; 2) modification of the share pool
    available under the 2004 Plan to reflect a ratio-based pool,
    where the grant of each full-value award, such as a share of
    restricted stock or an RSU decreases the pool



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

by two shares; and 3) a change in the form of equity grants
    to our non-employee directors from stock options to a fixed
    dollar amount of RSUs.

Assumed
    Veritas stock options

In connection with our acquisition of Veritas, we assumed each
    outstanding option to purchase Veritas common stock with an
    exercise price equal to or less than $49.00 as well as each
    additional option required to be assumed by applicable law. Each
    option assumed was converted into an option to purchase Symantec
    common stock after applying the exchange ratio of
    1.1242 shares of Symantec common stock for each share of
    Veritas common stock. In total, we assumed and converted Veritas
    options into options to purchase 66 million shares of
    Symantec common stock. In addition, we assumed and converted all
    outstanding Veritas RSUs into approximately 425,000 Symantec
    RSUs based on the exchange ratio.

The assumed options and RSUs retained all applicable terms and
    vesting periods. In general, the assumed options vest over a
    four-year period from the original date of grant. Options
    granted prior to May 2004 generally have a maximum term of
    10 years and options granted thereafter generally have a
    maximum term of seven years. The assumed RSUs generally vest
    over a three or four year period from the original date of grant.

Other
    stock option plans

Options remain outstanding under several other stock option
    plans, including the 2001 Non-Qualified Equity Incentive Plan,
    the 1999 Acquisition Plan, the 1996 Plan, and various plans
    assumed in connection with acquisitions. No further options may
    be granted under any of these plans.

Acceleration
    of stock option vesting

On March 30, 2006, we accelerated the vesting of certain
    stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than
    $27.00 per share that were outstanding on that date. We did
    not accelerate the vesting of any stock options held by our
    executive officers or directors. The vesting of options to
    purchase approximately 7 million shares of common stock, or
    approximately 14% of our outstanding unvested options, was
    accelerated. The weighted-average exercise price of the stock
    options for which vesting was accelerated was $28.73. We
    accelerated the vesting of the options to reduce future
    stock-based compensation expense that we would otherwise be
    required to recognize in our results of operations after
    adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Because of system
    constraints, it is not practicable for us to estimate the amount
    by which the acceleration of vesting will reduce our future
    stock-based compensation expense. The acceleration of the
    vesting of these options did not result in a charge to expense
    in fiscal 2006.

Valuation
    of stock-based awards

The fair value of each stock option granted under our equity
    incentive plans and each ESPP purchase right granted prior to
    July 1, 2005 is estimated on the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
    weighted-average assumptions:

The expected life of options is based on an analysis of our

    life of the option. Expected volatility is based on the average
    of the historical volatility for the period commensurate with
    the expected life of the option and the



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

implied volatility of traded options. The risk free interest
    rate is equal to the U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates
    for the period equal to the expected life. We do not currently
    pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate
    doing so in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, our expected
    dividend yield is zero. The fair value of each RSU is equal to
    the market value of Symantec’s common stock on the date of
    grant. The fair value of each ESPP purchase right granted from
    July 1, 2005 onwards is equal to the 15% discount on shares
    purchased. We estimate forfeitures of options, RSUs, and ESPP
    purchase rights at the time of grant based on historical
    experience and record compensation expense only for those awards
    that are expected to vest.

Stock-based
    compensation expense

Stock-based compensation is classified in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income in the same expense line items as cash
    compensation. The following table sets forth the total
    stock-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated

Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we provided
    the pro forma information regarding net income and net income
    per share required by SFAS No. 123. This information
    was required to be determined as if we had accounted for our
    employee stock options, including shares issued under our ESPP,
    granted subsequent to March 31, 1995 under the fair value
    method of SFAS No. 123. We generally did not recognize
    stock-based compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements
    of Income for option grants to our employees for the periods
    prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 123R because the
    exercise price of options granted was equal to the fair market
    value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Prior
    to April 1, 2006, stock-based compensation expense resulted
    primarily from stock options and RSUs assumed in acquisitions
    and restricted stock granted to executives. The following table
    illustrates the effect on net income and net income per share as
    if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation

Restructuring

As of March 31, 2007, we had a restructuring and employee
    termination benefit reserve of $57 million, of which
    $52 million was included in Other accrued expenses in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets and $5 million was included in
    Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    The restructuring reserve consisted of $47 million related
    to restructuring reserves established in fiscal 2007,
    $4 million related to a restructuring reserve assumed from
    Veritas in connection with the acquisition, and $6 million
    related to restructuring reserves established in fiscal 2006.

Restructuring
    expense

In fiscal 2007, we recorded approximately $70 million of
    restructuring and employee termination benefit expenses which
    consist of $19 million related to severance, associated
    benefits, and outplacement services for the termination of
    approximately 323 employees located in the Americas, Europe, and
    Asia Pacific and $51 million related to the 2007 cost
    savings initiative announced in January 2007. We implemented the
    2007 cost savings initiative to better align our expenses with
    our new revenue expectations. The costs included in our 2007
    cost savings initiative reflect $50 million related to
    severance, associated benefits, and outplacement services and an
    insignificant amount related to excess facilities. These
    restructuring and employee termination benefit costs under the
    2007 cost savings initiative reflect the termination of
    approximately 988 employees located in the Americas, Europe, and
    Asia Pacific and the consolidation of certain facilities in
    Europe and Asia Pacific. We paid $24 million under the
    restructuring and employee termination benefit reserves
    established in fiscal 2007. We expect the remainder of the costs
    to be paid by the end of fiscal 2008.

In fiscal 2006, we recorded $25 million of restructuring
    costs, of which $18 million related to severance,
    associated benefits, and outplacement services and
    $7 million related to excess facilities. These
    restructuring costs



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

reflect the termination of 446 redundant employees located in
    the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific and the consolidation of
    certain facilities in Europe and Asia Pacific. At March 31,
    2006, $9 million remained related to this reserve. In
    fiscal 2007, we paid $4 million related to this
    restructuring reserve and recorded an insignificant amount of
    adjustments. At March 31, 2007, $5 million remained
    related to this reserve, the majority of which relates to
    restructured facilities. We expect the remainder of the costs to
    be paid by the end of fiscal 2018.

Amounts related to restructuring expense are included in
    Restructuring in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Acquisition-related
    restructuring

In connection with the Veritas acquisition, we assumed a
    restructuring reserve of $53 million related to the 2002
    Veritas facilities restructuring plan. At March 31, 2006,
    $9 million remained related to this reserve. During fiscal
    2007, we paid $6 million related to this reserve and
    increased this reserve by an insignificant amount as we
    determined that the costs related to certain facilities would be
    greater than originally accrued. The remaining reserve amount of
    $4 million will be paid over the remaining lease terms,
    ending at various dates through 2015. The majority of costs are
    currently scheduled to be paid by the end of fiscal 2012.

In connection with the Veritas acquisition, we recorded
    $7 million of restructuring costs, of which $2 million
    related to excess facilities costs and $5 million related
    to severance, associated benefits, and outplacement services.
    These restructuring costs reflect the termination of redundant
    employees and the consolidation of certain facilities as a
    result of the Veritas acquisition. At March 31, 2007, an
    insignificant amount remained related to this reserve. At
    March 31, 2006, $3 million remained related to this
    reserve. During fiscal 2007, we paid an insignificant amount
    related to this reserve and reduced this reserve by
    $2 million as we determined that the costs related to
    certain facilities would be less than originally accrued. We
    expect the remainder of the costs to be paid by the end of
    fiscal 2008.

In connection with our other acquisitions in fiscal 2006, we
    recorded $12 million of restructuring costs, of which
    $8 million related to severance, associated benefits, and
    outplacement services and $4 million related to excess
    facilities costs. These restructuring costs reflect the
    termination of redundant employees and the consolidation of
    certain facilities as a result of our other acquisitions. At
    March 31, 2006, $9 million remained related to this
    reserve. At March 31, 2007, an insignificant amount
    remained related to this reserve. During fiscal 2007, we paid
    $5 million related to this reserve and reduced this reserve
    by an insignificant amount as we determined that the costs
    related to certain facilities would be less than originally
    accrued. We expect the remainder of the costs to be paid by the
    end of fiscal 2012.

Amounts related to acquisition-related restructuring are
    reflected in the purchase price allocation of the applicable
    acquisition.

Of the $60 million total valuation allowance provided
    against our deferred tax assets, approximately $54 million
    is attributable to acquisition-related assets, the benefit of
    which will reduce goodwill when and if realized. The valuation
    allowance decreased by $6 million in fiscal 2007, all of
    which was attributable to acquisition-related assets, the
    benefit of which reduced goodwill. The valuation allowance
    increased by $59 million in fiscal 2006, of which
    approximately $58 million was attributable to
    acquisition-related assets.

As of March 31, 2007, we have net operating loss and credit
    carryforwards attributable to various acquired companies of
    approximately $302 million and $14 million,
    respectively, which, if not used, will expire between fiscal
    2012 and 2025. These net operating loss carryforwards are
    subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code
    §382, but are expected to be fully realized. Furthermore,
    we have state net loss and credit carryforwards attributable to
    various acquired companies of approximately $500 million
    and $34 million, respectively, which will expire in various
    fiscal years. In addition, we have foreign net operating loss
    carryforwards attributable to various acquired foreign companies
    of approximately $659 million, which, under current
    applicable foreign tax law, can be carried forward indefinitely.

As of March 31, 2007, no provision has been made for
    federal or state income taxes on $1 billion of cumulative
    unremitted earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries,
    since we plan to indefinitely reinvest these earnings. As of
    March 31, 2007, the unrecognized deferred tax liability for
    these earnings was $290 million.

In the March 2005 quarter, we repatriated $500 million from
    certain of our foreign subsidiaries under provisions of the
    American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the Jobs Act, enacted in
    October 2004. We recorded a tax charge for this repatriation of
    $54 million in the March 2005 quarter.

In May 2005, clarifying language was issued by the
    U.S. Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue
    Service, or IRS, with respect to the treatment of foreign taxes
    paid on the earnings repatriated under the Jobs Act and



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

in September 2005, additional clarifying language was issued
    regarding the treatment of certain deductions attributable to
    the earnings repatriation. As a result of this clarifying
    language, we reduced the tax expense attributable to the
    repatriation by approximately $21 million in fiscal 2006,
    which reduced the cumulative tax charge on the repatriation to
    $33 million.

On March 29, 2006, we received a Notice of Deficiency from
    the IRS claiming that we owe additional taxes, plus interest and
    penalties, for the 2000 and 2001 tax years based on an audit of
    Veritas, which we acquired in July 2005. The incremental tax
    liability asserted by the IRS with regard to the Veritas claim
    was $867 million, excluding penalties and interest. The
    Notice of Deficiency primarily relates to transfer pricing in
    connection with a technology license agreement between Veritas
    and a foreign subsidiary. We do not agree with the IRS position
    and we have petitioned the Tax Court to protest the assessment.
    In the March 2007 quarter, the IRS agreed to dismiss any penalty
    assessment, and we have otherwise agreed to settle several of
    the lesser issues (representing $35 million of the total
    assessment) for $7 million of tax. As a result, the
    outstanding issue represents $832 million of tax. No
    payments will be made on the assessment until the issue is
    definitively resolved. If, upon resolution, we are required to
    pay an amount in excess of our provision for this matter, the
    incremental amounts due would be accounted for principally as
    additions to the cost of Veritas purchase price. Any incremental
    interest accrued subsequent to the date of the Veritas
    acquisition would be recorded as an expense in the period the
    matter is resolved.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we made $90 million
    of tax-related adjustments to the purchase accounting for
    Veritas, consisting of $120 million of additional
    pre-acquisition tax reserve-related adjustments, partially
    offset by a $30 million reduction in other pre-acquisition
    taxes payable. While we strongly disagree with the IRS over both
    its transfer pricing methodologies and the amount of the
    assessment, we have established additional tax reserves for all
    Veritas pre-acquisition years to account for both contingent tax
    and interest risk.

On March 30, 2006, we received notices of proposed
    adjustment from the IRS with regard to an unrelated audit of
    Symantec for fiscal 2003 and 2004. The IRS claimed that we owed
    an incremental tax liability with regard to this audit of
    $110 million, excluding penalties and interest. The
    incremental tax liability primarily related to transfer pricing
    matters between Symantec and a foreign subsidiary. On
    September 5, 2006, we executed a closing agreement with the
    IRS with respect to the audit of Symantec’s fiscal 2003 and
    2004 federal income tax returns. The closing agreement
    represents the final assessment by the IRS of additional tax for
    these fiscal years of approximately $35 million, including
    interest. Based on the final settlement, a tax benefit of
    $8 million is reflected in the September 2006 quarter.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we increased our tax
    reserves by an additional $64 million in connection with
    all open Symantec tax years (fiscal 2003 to 2006). Since these
    reserves relate to licensing arising from acquired technology,
    the additional accruals are primarily offset by deferred taxes.

We are as yet unable to confirm our eligibility to claim a lower
    tax rate on a distribution made from a Veritas foreign
    subsidiary prior to the acquisition. The distribution was
    intended to be made pursuant to the Jobs Act, and therefore
    eligible for a 5.25% effective U.S. federal rate of tax, in
    lieu of the 35% statutory rate. We are seeking a ruling from the
    IRS on the matter. Because we were unable to obtain this ruling
    prior to filing the Veritas tax return in May 2006, we paid
    $130 million of additional U.S. taxes. Since this
    payment relates to the taxability of foreign earnings that are
    otherwise the subject of the IRS assessment, this additional
    payment reduced the amount of taxes payable accrued as part of
    the purchase accounting for pre-acquisition contingent tax risks.

Note 14.

Litigation

On March 29, 2006, we received a Notice of Deficiency from
    the IRS claiming that we owe additional taxes, plus interest and
    penalties, for the 2000 and 2001 tax years based on an audit of
    Veritas. The incremental tax liability asserted by the IRS was
    $867 million, excluding penalties and interest. On
    June 26, 2006, we filed a petition with the U.S. Tax
    Court protesting the IRS claim for such additional taxes. On
    August 30, 2006, the IRS answered our petition and this
    matter has been docketed for trial in U.S. Tax Court. We
    have subsequently agreed to pay $7 million



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

out of $35 million originally assessed by the IRS in
    connection with one of the issues covered in the assessment. The
    IRS has also agreed to waive the assessment of penalties. We do
    not agree with IRS on the $832 million remaining at issue.
    We strongly believe the IRS’ position with regard to this
    matter is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and existing
    Treasury regulations, and that our previously reported income
    tax provision for the years in question is appropriate. See
    Note 13 for additional information on this matter.

On July 7, 2004, a purported class action complaint
    entitled Paul Kuck, et al. v. Veritas Software Corporation,
    et al. was filed in the United States District Court for
    the District of Delaware. The lawsuit alleges violations of
    federal securities laws in connection with Veritas’
    announcement on July 6, 2004 that it expected results of
    operations for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2004 to
    fall below earlier estimates. The complaint generally seeks an
    unspecified amount of damages. Subsequently, additional
    purported class action complaints have been filed in Delaware
    federal court, and, on March 3, 2005, the Court entered an
    order consolidating these actions and appointing lead plaintiffs
    and counsel. A consolidated amended complaint, or CAC, was filed
    on May 27, 2005, expanding the class period from
    April 23, 2004 through July 6, 2004. The CAC also
    named another officer as a defendant and added allegations that
    Veritas and the named officers made false or misleading
    statements in the company’s press releases and SEC filings
    regarding the company’s financial results, which allegedly
    contained revenue recognized from contracts that were unsigned
    or lacked essential terms. The defendants to this matter filed a
    motion to dismiss the CAC in July 2005; the motion was denied in
    May 2006. The defendants to this matter intend to defend this
    case vigorously. Because our liability, if any, cannot be
    reasonably estimated, no amounts have been accrued for this
    matter. An adverse outcome in this matter could have a material
    adverse affect on our financial position and results of
    operations.

We are also involved in a number of other judicial and
    administrative proceedings that are incidental to our business.
    Although adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur in one or
    more of the cases, it is not possible to estimate the possible
    loss or losses from each of these cases. The final resolution of
    these lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, is not
    expected to have a material adverse affect on our financial
    condition or results of operations.

Note 15.

Segment
    Information

In the June 2006 quarter, we consolidated our Enterprise
    Security, Data Protection, and Storage and Server Management
    segments into two segments: the Security and Data Management
    segment and the Data Center Management segment. Amounts for
    fiscal 2006 and 2005 have been reclassified to conform to our
    current presentation.

Our operating segments are significant strategic business units
    that offer different products and services, distinguished by
    customer needs. As of March 31, 2007, we operated in five
    operating segments:

•

Consumer Products.

Our Consumer Products
    segment focuses on delivering our Internet security, PC tuneup,
    and backup products to individual users and home offices.

•

Security and Data Management.

Our Security and
    Data Management segment focuses on providing large to small and
    medium-sized businesses with solutions for compliance and
    security management, endpoint security, messaging management,
    and data protection management software solutions that allow our
    customers to secure, provision, backup, and remotely access
    their laptops, PCs, mobile devices, and servers.

•

Data Center Management.

Our Data Center
    Management segment focuses on providing enterprise and large
    enterprise customers with storage and server management, data
    protection, and application performance management solutions
    across heterogeneous storage and server platforms.

•

Services.

Our Services segment consists of
    consultants with extensive technical knowledge, business
    expertise, and global insight across multi-vendor environments
    who assist organizations in managing IT risk on an ongoing
    basis. We provide customers with maintenance and technical
    support, consulting, education, and business critical services.



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

•

Other.

Our Other segment is comprised of
    sunset products and products nearing the end of their life
    cycle. It also includes general and administrative expenses;
    amortization of acquired product rights, other intangible
    assets, and other assets; charges, such as acquired in-process
    research and development, patent settlement, stock-based
    compensation, and restructuring; and certain indirect costs that
    are not charged to the other operating segments.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
    described in the summary of significant accounting policies,
    with the exception of the amortization of acquired product
    rights, which is included entirely in our Other segment. There
    are no intersegment sales. Our chief operating decision maker
    evaluates performance based on direct profit or loss from
    operations before income taxes not including nonrecurring gains
    and losses, foreign exchange gains and losses, and miscellaneous
    other income and expenses. Except for goodwill, as disclosed in
    Note 4, the majority of our assets are not discretely
    identified by segment. The depreciation and amortization of our
    property, equipment, and leasehold improvements are allocated
    based on headcount, unless specifically identified by segment.

    River, Inc., accounted for more than 10% of our total net

Note 16.

Cumulative
    Adjustment to Net Revenues and Deferred Revenue

In August 2004, during a review of our revenue maintenance
    application used to calculate the amount of deferred revenue for
    our consumer products, we discovered an error in the unit
    renewal prices manually entered into the application. The unit
    renewal prices used to calculate the deferred revenue did not
    reflect the correct subscription renewal prices for foreign
    currency sales, which serves as the basis for our deferral. As a
    result, the deferred revenue from these consumer products was
    understated and the portion of revenue from these products that
    was recognized at the time of sale was overstated. The
    cumulative overstatement of revenue for periods prior to the
    three months ended June 30, 2004 totaled approximately
    $20 million. The effect of the error was not material to
    any prior period. To correct this error, we recorded the
    cumulative $20 million as a reduction in Net revenues in
    the Consolidated Statements of Income and a corresponding
    $20 million increase in Current deferred revenue in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets during the three-month period ended
    June 2004. Substantially all of the $20 million of current
    deferred revenue was recognized as revenue during fiscal 2005.

Subsequent
    Events

On April 6, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Altiris,
    Inc., a leading provider of information technology management
    software that enables businesses to easily manage and service
    network-based endpoints. The aggregate purchase price, excluding
    acquisition related costs, was approximately $815 million
    in cash, which amount is net of Altiris’ cash balance. We
    believe this acquisition will enable us to help customers better
    manage and enforce security policies at the endpoint, identify
    and protect against threats, and repair and service assets. As
    of the date of the filing of this annual report, it is not
    practicable to disclose the condensed balance sheet and
    preliminary purchase price allocation for Altiris as of the date
    of acquisition.

From April 1 through May 23, 2007, we repurchased
    14 million shares at prices ranging from $19.53 to
    $19.88 per share for an aggregate amount of
    $275 million. As of May 23, 2007, $225 million
    remained authorized for future repurchases.

In May 2007 we signed an agreement to form a joint venture with
    Huawei Technologies Co., LDT. The joint venture will develop,
    manufacture, market and support security and storage appliances
    to global telecommunications carriers and enterprise customers.
    We will contribute storage and security software and
    $150 million in cash and will receive a 49% interest in the
    joint venture. The joint venture is expected to close late in
    calendar year 2007, pending required regulatory and governmental
    approvals.
