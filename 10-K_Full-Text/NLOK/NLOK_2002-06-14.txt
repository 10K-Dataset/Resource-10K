Introduction

Symantec provides a broad range of content and
network security software and appliance solutions to
enterprises, individuals and service providers. We are a leading
provider of client, gateway and server security solutions for
virus protection, firewall and virtual private network,
vulnerability management, intrusion detection, Internet content
and e-mail filtering, remote management technologies and
security services to enterprises and service providers around
the world. Founded in 1982, we have offices in 38 countries
worldwide.

Business Overview

We currently view our business in five operating
segments: Enterprise Security, Enterprise Administration,
Consumer Products, Services and Other. For financial information
related to our operating segments, see Note 17 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Enterprise
Security

Our Enterprise Security segment focuses on
providing Internet security technology, global response and
services necessary for organizations to manage their information
security needs. Our comprehensive solutions offer products to
protect gateways, servers, and clients (desktop PCs, laptops,
mobile devices and PDAs) with virus protection and filtering,
intrusion detection, vulnerability management, firewall security
and virtual private networking, or VPN. In addition, we have
expanded our technology offerings to include an integrated
solution at the gateway level combining several of our
individual technology solutions. At the gateway level, our
products run on Windows NT ®, Solaris®, and
Linux® platforms. Our products at the server level operate
on Windows NT, UNIX, Linux and other key server platforms. At
the client level, our products run on the Windows® platform.

Integrated
Solution

Symantec

TM

Gateway Security

combines firewall, antivirus, Internet
content filtering, intrusion detection, and VPN technologies
into one appliance. This integrated solution provides a second
level of protection against multi-faceted security threats that
antivirus and firewall protection alone cannot provide. It is a
flexible solution for small and medium-sized offices for
securing the gateway between the Internet and corporate networks
or between network segments.



Virus Protection and Filtering

Our virus protection and filtering technologies
are core elements of Internet security that combine multi-tier
protection against viruses with the management of Internet
communications for sensitive content or misuse of data. Users of
our virus protection and filtering products are able to take
action to protect their enterprise from risks associated with
using Internet resources. This includes scanning or monitoring
data that enters, leaves or travels inside the organization, as
well as detecting and eliminating malicious code that may be
introduced into a company’s network. Our virus protection
and e-mail and Internet content filtering technologies protect
gateways, servers and clients at multiple entry points from
known and unknown threats. Protection from virus attacks is the
most well-known and largest market component of the enterprise
security area.

Symantec
AntiVirus

TM

offers the flexibility of a bundled, multi-tiered antivirus
solution to protect the enterprise’s network, including
Internet gateways, desktops, file and print servers, mail
servers and firewalls. Symantec AntiVirus also enables
corporations to keep their virus definitions up to date via
LiveUpdate.

Symantec
CarrierScan

TM

Server provides advanced, high-performance virus scanning and
repair services for the NetApp® filer and NetCache®
devices from Network Appliance. Symantec CarrierScan server
employs Symantec antivirus technologies to detect viruses,
worms, and Trojan horses in all major file types, including
mobile code and compressed file formats. Virus definitions and
engines are updated automatically with no interruption in virus
scanning. Symantec CarrierScan accommodates growing scan volumes
and additional servers, and provides automatic load balancing
across multiple servers.

Firewalls/ VPN

We offer firewall and VPN solutions that protect
throughout the network, including at Internet gateways, gateways
to sensitive internal networks and at client devices.

Symantec

TM

Enterprise Firewall

, a gateway software firewall product,
protects enterprise assets and business transactions. As a
comprehensive full inspection firewall, Symantec Enterprise

protection against unwanted intrusion while enabling the flow of
approved traffic for offices with 25 to 25,000 nodes. Through
its optional VPN, it can also provide high-speed and cost
effective remote connectivity between mobile workers and the
office.

Symantec

TM

Desktop Firewall

enables administrators to quickly roll
out an effective solution that works intelligently in the
background, monitoring both inbound and outbound communications.

firewall and VPN appliance that employs our full-inspection
technology to provide fast and secure Internet connectivity.
Symantec VelociRaptor delivers enterprise-class network security
for offices with 30 to 5,000 users.

Intrusion Detection

Organizations must protect information from
unwanted users and hackers and control access to information to
maintain business integrity. At the gateway and server level,
our intrusion detection products



monitor systems for patterns of misuse and abuse
and can warn organizations before systems are misused or
information is stolen.

Symantec Intruder
Alert

TM

is a host-based, real-time intrusion detection system that
detects security breaches and automatically responds according
to pre-established security policies. By alerting administrators
of potential problems, it enables enterprises to develop
precautionary security policies that prevent hackers or
authorized users with malicious intent from misusing systems,
applications, and data.

Symantec
NetProwler

TM

complements existing security countermeasures and fortifies a
company’s e-business initiatives by offering dynamic
network intrusion detection that transparently examines network
traffic. It is designed to instantly identify, log, and
terminate unauthorized use, misuse and abuse of computer systems
by internal saboteurs and external hackers.

Vulnerability Management

At the gateway and server level, our
vulnerability management products find system vulnerabilities
and help to ensure security policy compliance to proactively
reduce business risk. The initial step to reduce corporate risk
is to effectively measure compliance to a business security
policy and detect vulnerabilities where critical information
resides. It is important to understand the effectiveness of a
security policy in order to properly define, manage and enforce
business policies and assess possible threats.

Symantec Enterprise Security
Manager

TM

gives enterprises the ability to automate the discovery of
security vulnerabilities and deviations of the security policy
in mission critical e-business applications and servers across
the enterprise from a single location. Symantec Enterprise
Security Manager provides intelligent tools that allow
administrators to create a pre-defined security baseline for
every system on the network and measure performance against that
baseline.

Symantec
NetRecon

TM

provides network vulnerability assessment with progressive
scanning technology. Its root-cause analysis engine illustrates
the exact sequence of steps taken to uncover vulnerabilities.
Symantec NetRecon displays vulnerability data as it scans, then
provides the appropriate reports so administrators do not have
to search through volumes of data.

Enterprise Administration

Our Enterprise Administration segment offers
products that enable companies to be more effective and
efficient within their information technology departments.
Remote management solutions help professionals remain productive
while away from the office, while also providing companies
access to information, applications and data from any location.

Symantec
pcAnywhere

TM

offers secure, reliable, fast and flexible point-to-point remote
computing via a multitude of communications media including
Internet, serial, LAN, ISDN, DSL, cable modems and infrared.
Symantec pcAnywhere enables a remote PC user to control and
transfer data to and from a host PC. In addition, the remote PC,
laptop or PC terminal controls the operation of the
often-distant host PC and allows users at the host machine to
view the operations being conducted from the remote site.

Symantec
Ghost

or application onto a PC in minutes and migrate user settings
and profiles to customize the PC.

Consumer Products

Our Consumer Products segment focuses on
delivering our security and problem-solving products to
individual users, home offices and small businesses. The
segment’s charter is to ensure that consumers and their
information are secure and protected in a connected world. Most
of the products that we are currently marketing or developing

products, products nearing the end of their life cycle, and
operations from our web access management, Visual
Café

TM

and ACT!

TM

divested product
lines.



Recent Acquisitions and Divestitures

Acquisitions

Since our initial public offering on
June 23, 1989, we have completed acquisitions of
25 businesses.

Our recent acquisitions were as follows:

We accounted for each of these acquisitions as a
purchase and, accordingly, we have included the operating
results of these businesses in our consolidated financial
statements since their respective dates of acquisition. We have
acquired several businesses in the past, including Peter Norton
Computing, Inc. on August 31, 1990. We continue to use the
Norton brand name for certain consumer products developed and
marketed by us.

Divestitures

We divested our web access management product
line on August 24, 2001 and the Visual Café and
substantially all of the ACT! product lines on December 31,
1999. We have included the operating results of these product
lines prior to disposition in our Other segment. The divestiture
of the Visual Café and ACT! product lines enabled us to
focus our efforts and resources on our Internet security
business. The Visual Café and ACT! product lines comprised
a significant part of our business prior to their disposition.

For further discussion on our recent acquisitions
and divestitures, see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Sales and Marketing

We license our corporate and enterprise products
through our distributors, corporate resellers, value-added
resellers and system integrator channels, in addition to our
direct sales force.

We sell our consumer products to individuals and
small offices/ home offices around the world through a
multi-tiered distribution network. Our products are available to
customers through channels that include: distributors,
retailers, mail order resellers, Internet-based resellers or
“e-tailers,” original equipment manufacturers,
educational institutions and Internet service providers. We also
sell some of our products and product upgrades through direct
mail and over the Internet, in conjunction with channel partners.

We maintain distribution relationships with major
independent distributors. Our indirect sales force works closely
with our major distributor and reseller accounts to manage the
flow of orders, inventory levels and sales to customers. We also
work closely with them to execute channel promotions and other
marketing activities associated with these promotions.

Our agreements with distributors are generally
nonexclusive and may be terminated by either party without
cause. These distributors are not within our control and are not
obligated to purchase products from us. They also distribute
other vendors’ product lines. For information with respect
to distributors that represent more than 10% of our net
revenues, see Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements of this Form 10-K.



Our marketing activities include:

For our consumer products, we typically offer two
types of rebate programs within most countries: volume incentive
rebates to channel partners and promotional rebates to
end-users. The distributor or reseller earns a volume incentive
rebate based upon the volume of their purchases and their sale
of products to end-users. From time to time, we also make
rebates available to individual users of various products
acquired through major retailers. We regularly offer upgrade
rebates to existing customers purchasing a new version of a
product. Both volume incentive rebates and end-user rebates are
accrued as an offset to revenue when revenue is originally
recorded.

Product returns occur when we introduce upgrades
and new versions of products or when distributors or retailers
have excess inventories, subject to various contractual
limitations. Our return policy allows distributors, subject to
these contractual limitations, to return purchased products in
exchange for new products or for credit towards future
purchases. End users may return our products through dealers and
distributors for a full refund within a reasonably short period
from the date of purchase. We estimate and record reserves for
such product returns. For further discussion, see
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations, “Critical Accounting
Policies” and the Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements of this
Form 10-K.

International Sales

Revenues outside of the United States represented
approximately 47%, 48% and 45% of our net revenues during fiscal
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The majority of our net revenues from Europe are
derived from sales by affiliates of our major United States
distributors. Additionally, we sell our products through
authorized distributors, which may be restricted to specified
territories. For most of our consumer products, we translate the
documentation, software and packaging into the local language
and prepare marketing programs for each local market.

We have marketing offices in Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Israel,
Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, United Arab Emirates
and the United Kingdom. These local offices



facilitate our marketing and distribution in
international markets. Our international operations are subject
to various risks common to international operations, including:

Symantec

TM

Security
Response

Symantec Security Response is a team of dedicated
intrusion experts, security engineers, virus hunters and global
technical support teams that work in tandem to provide extensive
coverage for enterprise businesses and consumers. Symantec
Security Response provides customers with comprehensive, global,
24x7 Internet security expertise to guard against
today’s blended Internet threats, threats that are
multi-faceted in their operating methods and effects.

Symantec Security Response addresses blended
threats by providing a thorough analysis of Internet security
threats, evaluating how threats work together, then offering
recommendations on protection. This allows us to respond to
complex security threats in a more holistic, preventive manner.
A Symantec Security Response analysis can show how multiple
threats work together, how this could impact a customer, and how
to protect against these threats.

Symantec Security Response delivers
knowledgeable, proactive security protection through product
security policies and best practice guidelines that can be
updated and distributed through automated processes.
Additionally, Symantec Security Response provides rapid reactive
security protection through its incident response program,
including emergency antivirus signatures, definitions and
policies, as well as outbound communications such as alerting
services.

Research Centers

The research centers of Symantec Security
Response are focused on collecting and analyzing the latest
malware threats from network security threats and
vulnerabilities to viruses and worms. When a new threat or
vulnerability is discovered, Symantec Security Response experts
provide rapid emergency response, focusing on communication with
customers and delivery of security updates for our security
products.

Symantec Security Response researchers represent
a cross-section of many of the most highly regarded security
experts in the industry. Research centers are located around the
world, including North America, Asia, Australia and Europe.

To ensure that customers are utilizing the most
recent technologies available for addressing security issues,
Symantec Security Response experts leverage our sophisticated
back-end product architecture. This architecture allows users to
receive the latest security updates — including virus
definitions and intrusion detection signatures —
automatically in the event of a new security threat or outbreak.
LiveUpdate technology simplifies and speeds the process of
receiving and implementing security updates for our security
product offerings at the server, gateway and desktop levels.

Communication Methods

Symantec Security Response not only provides
time-sensitive security advisories using web updates, but also
provides alerting services, technical support and media alerts.
Symantec Security Response is committed to educating the general
public about key security threats and trends through published
white papers and speaking engagements worldwide.



Technical Support

With more than 300 experts in Internet
security and desktop and network management, as well as our
complete product solutions, our global technical support team is
available around the clock. Our technical support experts
provide customers with information on product implementation and
usage, as well as countermeasures and identification tools for
new threats.

We maintain centralized support facilities
throughout the world to drive rapid response to complex queries.
Support is available in multiple languages, including Dutch,
English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin,
Portuguese and Spanish.

Enterprise Security Support

Our enterprise security support program offers
annual support contracts to all enterprise customers worldwide.
Our standard annual support contracts provide 1) hot-line
service delivered by telephone, fax, e-mail and over the
Internet; 2) immediate patches for severe problems;
3) periodic software updates; 4) access to our
technical knowledge base and FAQ facility; and 5) an
invitation to the annual user group meeting. Inclusive in these
standard annual support contracts are virus definitions and
intrusion detection signatures created by Symantec Security
Response. Customers may augment their standard annual support
contract with services such as 24x7x365 hour telephone and
web support, advanced alerting services, additional designated
callers (contacts) and additional language support, as well as a
Technical Account Manager, assigned to work closely with an
organization and act as a focal point for all issues.

Consumer Product
Support

Our product support program provides free
self-help online services to all consumer customers worldwide.
In some countries, access to free telephone support is provided
for a limited period of 30 to 90 days, depending upon the
country. After the initial period, telephone support is provided
for a fee throughout North America, as well as portions of Asia
Pacific and Europe. For some of our international customers, we
continue to transition our product support to be entirely fee
based telephone support, along with free self-help online
support. For customers that subscribe to them, the latest virus
definitions and application bug fixes and/or patches for most of
our currently marketed and developed products are downloaded
automatically through LiveUpdate, created by Symantec Security
Response.

We revise these fee-based support programs from
time to time as customer requirements change and as market
trends dictate.

Product Development, Partnerships, Investments
and Acquisitions

We use a multiple product sourcing strategy that
includes, as necessary:

We develop software products that are designed to
operate on a variety of operating systems. We typically develop
new products and enhancements of existing products through
focused product development groups with support from our core
technology group. Each segment is responsible for its own
design, development, documentation and quality assurance.

Independent contractors are used for aspects of
the product development process. In addition, elements of some
of our products are licensed from third-party developers.

We invest in companies with emerging technologies
and companies that promote the sale and use of our products.
These investments are made in lieu of an acquisition when timing
is inappropriate or when the



business models and sectors fall out of our
strategic requirements. We pursue investments, which we believe
will be complementary and which we believe can enhance both
financial returns and market growth.

We use strategic acquisitions as necessary to
provide certain technology, people and products for our overall
product strategy. We consider both timeliness to market and
potential market share growth when evaluating acquisitions of
technologies, product lines or companies. We have completed a
number of acquisitions of technologies, companies and products,
in the past, and have also disposed of technologies and
products. We may acquire and/or dispose of other technologies,
companies and products in the future. For further discussion on
our acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 3 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Competition

Our markets are intensely competitive and are
subject to rapid changes in technology. They are influenced by
the rapid change in Internet security threats and the strategic
direction of major computer hardware manufacturers, Internet
service providers, application service providers, key
application software vendors and operating system providers. Our
competitiveness depends on our ability to deliver products that
meet our customers’ needs by enhancing our existing
solutions and offering reliable, scalable and standardized new
solutions on a timely basis. We have limited resources, and as a
result, we must deploy our available resources thoughtfully. The
principal competitive factors in our Enterprise Security and
Administration and Consumer Products segments are quality,
employment of the most advanced technology, time to market,
price, reputation, breadth of product offerings, customer
support, brand recognition, and sales and marketing teams. In
our Services segment, the principal competitive factors include
technical capability, customer responsiveness, price, ability to
attract and retain talented and experienced personnel, and
reputation within the industry.

In the enterprise security and administration
market, we compete against several companies who offer competing
products to our technology solutions and to our Symantec Ghost
and pcAnywhere products and competing services to our response
and support. Some of the companies that we compete against are
Altiris, BindView, Checkpoint, Cisco, Computer Associates,
Internet Security Services, Netopia, NetScreen, Network
Associates, Okena, PentaSafe, PowerQuest, Stac Software,
SonicWALL, Sophos, Traveling Software, Trend Micro, Watchguard
and WebSense. Some of the companies that offer competing
products to our Consumer Products offerings include Internet
Security Services, McAfee.com, Network Associates, Norman,
OnTrack (now owned by Kroll), Panda, Trend Micro and ZoneLabs.
With the recent outbreaks of viruses and other Internet-based
security threats, several other companies have entered the
market and may become significant competitors in the future.

Our Symantec Security Services competes with
companies such as Counterpane, Internet Security Services,
Network Associates and Riptech.

Price competition is intense with most of our
products and services. We expect price competition to continue
to increase and become even more significant in the future,
which may reduce our profit margins.

We also face competition from a number of other
products that offer levels of functionality different from those
offered by our products, or that were designed for a somewhat
different group of end-users than those targeted by us.
Operating system vendors such as Microsoft have added security
features to new versions of their products that provide some of
the same functions offered in our products. In addition, several
other operating systems are gaining market acceptance, such as
Red Hat® Linux, Solaris and Unix-based operating systems,
and they may also incorporate some of the advanced utilities or
other functionality offered in our products. While we plan to
continue to improve our products with a view toward providing
enhanced functionality over that provided in current and future
operating systems, these efforts may be unsuccessful and any
improved products may not be commercially accepted by users. We
will also continue to attempt to cooperate with operating system
vendors to make our products compatible with those operating
systems, while at the same time, differentiating our utility
products from features included in those operating systems. Our
efforts in this regard may be unsuccessful.



The demand for some of our products, including
those currently under development, may decrease if, among other
reasons:

•

Microsoft includes additional product features in
    future releases of Windows;

•

hardware vendors, including Cisco, incorporate
    additional server-based network management and security tools
    into network operating systems; or

•

competitors license certain of their products to
    Microsoft or original equipment manufacturers for inclusion in
    their operating systems or products.

In addition, we compete with other computer
software companies for access to retail distribution channels
and for the attention of customers at the retail level and in
corporate accounts. We also compete with other software
companies to acquire products or companies and to publish
software developed by third parties.

Many of our existing and potential competitors
may have greater financial, marketing or technological resources
than we do. We believe that competition in the industry will
continue to intensify as other major software companies expand
their product lines into additional product categories.

Manufacturing

Our product development groups produce a set of
master CD-ROMs or diskettes and documentation for each product
that are then duplicated or replicated and packaged into
products by our logistics organization. Purchasing of all raw
materials is done by Symantec personnel in our Cupertino,
California and Dublin, Ireland facilities for products
manufactured in those countries. All of our domestic
manufacturing and order fulfillment is performed by an outside
contractor under the supervision of our domestic logistics
organization. These manufacturing steps that are subcontracted
to outside organizations include the replication of CD-ROMs,
printing of documentation materials and retail boxes, and
assembly of the final packages. For most products distributed
outside of North and South America, our Dublin, Ireland
manufacturing facility performs diskette duplication, assembly
of the final packages, and order fulfillment. Our Dublin,
Ireland manufacturing facility also subcontracts to outside
organizations for the replication of CD-ROMs and printing of
documentation materials and retail boxes.

Intellectual Property

We regard our software as proprietary. We attempt
to protect our software technology by relying on a combination
of copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark laws,
restrictions on disclosure and other methods. Litigation may be
necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to
protect trade secrets or trademarks or to determine the validity
and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Furthermore,
other parties have asserted and may, in the future, assert
infringement claims against us. For further discussion on our
current litigation, see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. These claims and
any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary
rights. Litigation, even if not meritorious, could result in
substantial costs and diversion of resources and management
attention.

Employees

As of March 31, 2002, we employed
approximately 3,900 people worldwide, including approximately
2,100 in sales, marketing and related staff activities, 890 in
product development, 150 in consulting services, and 760 in
management, manufacturing, administration and finance. In
connection with the relocation of our Leiden, Netherlands
operations to Dublin, Ireland in early fiscal year 2003, a group
of employees in the Leiden facility have joined a union to
negotiate the proposed terms of the transfer of operations to
our Dublin facility, focusing primarily on severance benefits
for employees that do not relocate to Dublin. Except for these
employees in our Leiden facility, no other employees are
represented by a labor union. We believe that relations with our
employees are good.



Item 2.

Properties

Our principal locations are as follows:

Our principal administrative, sales and marketing
facilities are located in Cupertino, California. We lease a
number of additional facilities for administrative, marketing,
localization and technical support in the United States, China,
Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Taiwan; for
administration, marketing and technical support in Australia,
Brazil, India, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea; and for
administration and marketing in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech
Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary,
Israel, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Russia, South Africa,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and the
United Kingdom.

We believe that our facilities are adequate for
current needs and that additional or substitute space will be
available as needed to accommodate any future expansion of our
operations.

PART II

Item 5.

Market
for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder
Matters

Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National
Market under the Nasdaq symbol “SYMC.” The high and
low closing sales prices set forth below are as reported on the
Nasdaq National Market. All closing sales prices have been
adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock dividend, which became
effective January 31, 2002.

Delrina exchangeable stock has been traded on the
Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol “DE.TO” since
the acquisition of Delrina by Symantec on November 22,
1995. The high and low closing sales prices set forth below are
in Canadian dollars as reported on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Delrina exchangeable stock is exchangeable at the option of the
stockholders on a one-for-one basis into Symantec common stock
until November 2002, at which point the Delrina exchangeable
shares will be required to be exchanged for Symantec common
stock and, accordingly, the Delrina exchangeable shares will
cease to exist.

As of March 31, 2002, there were
approximately 862 stockholders of record, including
approximately 20 holders of record of Delrina exchangeable
shares.

We have not paid cash dividends in the last two
fiscal years. We presently intend to retain future earnings, if
any, for use in our business, and therefore we do not anticipate
paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the
foreseeable future.



Item 6.

Selected
Financial Data

The following selected financial data is
qualified in its entirety by and should be read in conjunction

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That
May Affect Future Results

The following discussion contains forward-looking
statements that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties
and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of
activity, performance or achievements to be materially different
from any future results, levels of activity, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. Such factors include, among others things, those
risk factors set forth in this section and elsewhere in this
report. We identify forward-looking statements by words such as
“may,” “will,” “should,”
“could,” “expects,” “plans,”
“anticipates,” “believes,”
“estimates,” “predicts,”
“potential,” or “continue” or similar terms
that refer to the future. We cannot guarantee future results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements.

Overview

Symantec provides a broad range of content and
network security software and appliance solutions to
enterprises, individuals and service providers. We are a leading
provider of client, gateway and server security solutions for
virus protection, firewall and virtual private network,
vulnerability management, intrusion detection, Internet content
and e-mail filtering, remote management technologies and
security services to enterprises and service providers around
the world. Founded in 1982, we have offices in 38 countries
worldwide.

We have a 52/53-week fiscal accounting year.
Accordingly, all references as of and for the periods ended
March 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 reflect amounts as of and for
the periods ended March 29, 2002, March 30, 2001 and
March 31, 2000, respectively. The fiscal accounting years
ended March 29, 2002, March 30, 2001 and
March 31, 2000 each comprised 52 weeks of operations.

Revenue Recognition

We derive revenue primarily from sales of
packaged software products, perpetual software license
agreements, product maintenance and professional services, and
recognize this revenue in accordance with Statement of Position,
or SOP, 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition,

as modified
by SOP 98-9, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,

Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,

when the
following conditions have been met:

We sell packaged products through a multi-tiered
distribution channel. We defer revenue on all distribution and
reseller channel inventory in excess of specified inventory
levels in these channels. We offer the right of return of our
products under various policies and programs with our
distributors, resellers and end-user customers. We estimate and
record reserves for end-user product returns and channel and
end-user rebates, and we account for these reserves as an offset
to revenue.

We enter into perpetual software license
agreements through direct sales to customers and indirect sales
with distributors and resellers. The license agreements
generally include product maintenance agreements, for which the
related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the
period of the agreements.

Our professional services include consulting,
education, and managed security services. We recognize
consulting services revenue as services are performed or upon
written acceptance from customers, if



applicable. We recognize education services
revenue as services are performed. We recognize managed security
services revenue ratably over the period that such contracted
services are provided.

In arrangements that include software licenses
and maintenance and/or professional services, and packaged
products with content updates (“multiple elements”),
we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on
vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of
the undelivered elements, and recognize the difference between
the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the
undelivered items as revenue. VSOE of each element is based on
the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately.
If VSOE does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance
or professional services, then the entire arrangement fee is
recognized over the performance period.

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing our consolidated financial
statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that
can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating
income and net income (loss), as well as on the value of certain
assets on our consolidated balance sheet. We believe that the
estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting
policies described below have the greatest potential impact on
our consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to
be our critical accounting policies. See “Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies” beginning on page 50 in
the consolidated financial statements for more information about
these critical accounting policies, as well as descriptions of
other significant accounting policies. We have engaged in
discussions with our audit committee of the Board of Directors
regarding the development, selection and disclosure of our
critical accounting policies.

Channel Revenue Deferrals

We defer revenue relating to products, primarily
in our Consumer and Enterprise Administration segments, that we
have shipped into our distribution and reseller channels to the
extent that such shipments result in there being inventory in
excess of certain specified inventory levels for these channels.
We defer this revenue as an offset to accounts receivable. We
estimate the excess of inventory levels in these channels by
analyzing channel inventory level and distribution sell-through
trends obtained from our channel partners, as well as various
historical trends on a product basis. In addition, we consider
other factors in assessing these specified inventory levels,
such as product seasonality, current market conditions, economic
trends, existing security threats and timing of new product
releases. On the same basis, we estimate the associated cost of
revenues related to the channel revenue deferral. If we made
different judgments or utilized different estimates, material
differences may result in the amount and timing of our net
revenues and cost of revenues for any period presented.

Reserves for Product Returns

End-users may return our products, primarily
within our Enterprise Administration and Consumer segments,
through distributors and resellers or to us directly for a full
refund within a reasonably short period from the date of
purchase. Our estimated reserves for such end-user product
returns are based primarily on historical trends. Product
returns by distributors and resellers principally relate to
stock balancing and the replacement of obsolete products. Our
return policy allows distributors and resellers, subject to
certain contractual limitations, to return purchased products in
exchange for new products or for credit towards future
purchases. Channel revenue deferrals, as discussed above, are
designed to take into account any distributor and reseller stock
balancing returns. In addition, we fully reserve for obsolete
products in the distribution channels. We also consider other
factors such as the timing of upgrades and new versions of
products, current market conditions, economic trends and changes
in technology. If we made different judgments or utilized
different estimates, material differences may result in the
amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented.



Reserves for Rebates

We estimate and record reserves for channel and
end-user rebates, related primarily to products within our
Enterprise Security, Enterprise Administration and Consumer
segments. Our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive
rebates are based on distributors’ and resellers’
actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume
incentive rebate programs, which are typically entered into
quarterly. Our reserves for end-user rebates are estimated on
the terms and conditions of the promotional program, actual
sales during the promotion, amount of actual redemptions
received, historical redemption trends by product and by type of
promotional program and the value of the rebate. We also
consider current market conditions and economic trends when
estimating our reserve for rebates. If we made different
judgments or utilized different estimates, material differences
may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any
period presented.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to
reserve for potential uncollectible trade receivables. We review
our trade receivables by aging category to identify specific
customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. We
exercise judgment when determining the adequacy of these
reserves as we evaluate historical bad debt trends, general
economic conditions in the U.S. and internationally, and changes
in customer financial conditions. If we made different judgments
or utilized different estimates, material differences may result
in additional reserves for trade receivables, which would be
reflected by charges in general and administrative expenses for
any period presented.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate long-lived assets, including
property, equipment, leasehold improvements, acquired product
rights and goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized
when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected
to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition
is less than the assets carrying amount. Such impairment loss
would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount
of the asset and its fair value based on the present value of
estimated future cash flows. Significant judgment is required in
the forecasting of future operating results, which are used in
the preparation of projected cash flows. If we made different
judgments or utilized different estimates, material differences
may result in write-downs of net long-lived assets, which would
be reflected by charges to our operating results for any period
presented.

Effective April 1, 2002, impairment of
goodwill and other long-lived assets will be assessed according
to new accounting guidelines (see

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

below).

Restructuring and Site Closures

During fiscal 2002, we incurred expenses related
to consolidating, moving and relocating various groups or sites.
In determining the charge related to our excess facilities,
certain estimates were used, such as potential ability to
sublease and sublease terms upon the negotiation of future
subleases, broker commissions, costs of tenant improvements and
related exit costs. In developing our estimates, we obtained
information from third party leasing agents to calculate
anticipated third party sublease income and the vacancy period
prior to finding a sub-leasee. Market conditions will affect our
ability to sublease facilities on terms consistent with our
estimates. Our ability to sublease facilities ahead of schedule
or the negotiation of lease terms resulting in higher or lower
sublease income than estimated will affect our accrual and the
related charge for restructuring, site closures and other
expenses. Difference between estimates of related broker
commissions, tenant improvements and related exit costs may
increase or decrease our accrual upon final negotiation. If we
employed different assumptions regarding these various
components of our exit costs, the costs recorded for any period
presented could vary materially from those actually recorded.



Deferred Income Taxes

On a quarterly basis we evaluate our deferred tax
asset balance for realizability. To the extent we believe it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred
tax assets will not be realized, we will establish a valuation
allowance against the deferred tax assets. Realization of our
deferred tax assets is dependent upon future U.S. taxable income
and future taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions, as
well as our implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning
strategies. Our judgments regarding future profitability may
change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or
international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any,
may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax
assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in
net loss in the period when such determinations are made.

Recent Significant Acquisitions and
    Divestitures

In August 2001, we divested our web access
management product line, which we acquired in our acquisition of
AXENT, to PassGo Technologies Ltd. for approximately
$1.1 million. We also entered into an exclusive license and
option agreement with PassGo whereby they will license our web
access management technology products. In consideration for the
license, PassGo is required to pay us quarterly royalties based
on their net revenue over a four-year period. PassGo also has an
option to purchase this technology at a price starting at
$18.8 million and declining to $3.3 million over a
four-year period.

In December 2000, we acquired 100% of the
outstanding common stock of AXENT, an enterprise security
software company, in exchange for Symantec common stock. We also
assumed all of the outstanding AXENT employee stock options. The
transaction was accounted for as a purchase and was initially
recorded for approximately $924.7 million, which included
goodwill of $699.7 million, tangible and intangible assets
of $220.8 million, in-process research and development of
$22.3 million, deferred compensation of $992,000, offset by
$19.1 million in deferred income taxes. During the December
2001 quarter, we recorded additional deferred tax assets of
$5.0 million attributable to carryforward tax benefits,
with a corresponding offset to goodwill. During the June 2001
quarter, we increased the purchase price and goodwill by $4.5
million, as we resolved certain pre-acquisition contingencies.

Effective April 1, 2002, the related net
balance of goodwill and workforce-in-place for the AXENT
acquisitions and other acquisitions completed prior to
July 1, 2001 will no longer be amortized, but will be
subject to an annual impairment test. See

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements.

For further discussion on our recent
significant acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 3 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this
Form 10-K.



Results of Operations

The following table sets forth each item from our
consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net
revenues and the percentage change in the total amount of each
item for the periods indicated. Please note that these results
reflect our acquisition of AXENT commencing on December 18,
2000, the date of that acquisition.

*

Percentage change is not meaningful.

Net Revenues

Net revenues increased 26% to approximately
$1.1 billion during fiscal 2002 from $853.6 million
during fiscal 2001. Net revenues increased 14% to approximately
$853.6 million during fiscal 2001 from $745.7 million
during fiscal 2000. The increase during fiscal 2002 as compared
to fiscal 2001 was due primarily to increased sales of our
enterprise security products and a significant increase in sales
of our consumer products during the second half of fiscal 2002.
The increase in enterprise security products during fiscal 2002
was attributable to a full year of sales related to AXENT
solutions as compared to approximately three months during
fiscal 2001. From a regional standpoint, this increase was
primarily due to growth in net revenues in the United States and
to a lesser extent in Europe.

The increase during fiscal 2001 as compared to
fiscal 2000 was largely due to sales of our enterprise security
products, including introductions of new products and increased
sales outside of the United States.



The increase in enterprise security products
during fiscal 2001 was attributable to approximately three
months of sales related to AXENT solutions, as a result of our
acquisition of AXENT in December 2000.

Segments

Enterprise
Security

Our Enterprise Security segment revenue comprised
approximately 42%, 33% and 22% of total net revenues during
fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net revenues increased
$172.1 million, or 61%, to approximately
$454.9 million during fiscal 2002 from $282.8 million
during fiscal 2001 and increased $116.0 million, or 70%, to
$282.8 million during fiscal 2001 from $166.8 million
during fiscal 2000. The increase during fiscal 2002 over fiscal
2001 was primarily due to our first full year of sales of
intrusion detection, vulnerability management and firewall
product solutions, as a result of our acquisition of AXENT in
December 2000, and in particular, significant growth in sales of
virus protection product solutions.

Enterprise
Administration

Our Enterprise Administration segment represented
approximately 21%, 27% and 29% of total net revenues during
fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net revenues decreased
by approximately $8.1 million, or 4%, during fiscal 2002 as
compared to fiscal 2001 due to a decline in sales of our
pcAnywhere product, partially offset by growth in sales of our
Ghost Corporate Edition product. The decline in our pcAnywhere
product was the result of a decrease in small business and home
office sales, which was partially offset by an increase in
corporate sales.

Net revenues increased by approximately
$13.9 million, or 6%, during fiscal 2001 as compared to
fiscal 2000 primarily due to the release of our Ghost Corporate
Edition product.

Consumer
Products

Our Consumer Products segment represented
approximately 35%, 39% and 43% of total net revenues during
fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net revenues increased
by approximately $45.8 million, or 14%, during fiscal 2002
as compared to fiscal 2001. This increase was primarily related
to an increase in sales of our Norton AntiVirus and Norton
Internet Security products, mostly as a result of strong
consumer and small business spending, and an increase in the
renewal subscription pricing of our antivirus products. This
increase was offset by a decline in sales of our Winfax and
Macintosh products. In particular, we experienced a significant
increase in sales of consumer products over the second half of
fiscal 2002, and we do not expect sales to continue to grow at
the same rate going forward. Over the last six years, our sales
to individual consumers, home offices and small businesses have
been seasonal, with higher sales generally in our December and
March quarters.

Net revenues increased by approximately
$11.3 million, or 4%, during fiscal 2001 as compared to
fiscal 2000. This increase was primarily due to the increase in
customer focus on protecting their home computers from Internet
related attacks. This factor contributed to growth in sales of
our Norton Internet Security product, which was introduced in
the March 2000 quarter.

Services
and Other

Our Services and Other segments represented
approximately 2%, 1% and 6% of total net revenues during fiscal
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net revenues increased in
absolute dollars during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001,
due primarily to our services segment as the demand for our
consulting services increased. Net revenues decreased in
absolute dollars during fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000,
due to our divestiture of the Visual Café and ACT! product
lines in December 1999, which is included in the Other segment.



International

Net revenues outside of the United States
represented approximately 47%, 48% and 45% of total net revenues
during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. International
net revenues increased by $91.6 million, or 22%, to
approximately $504.6 million during fiscal 2002 as compared
to fiscal 2001. This increase in net revenues was the result of
increased sales in Europe and Asia, primarily from increased
sales of our enterprise security and consumer products.
International revenues increased by $77.3 million, or 23%,
to approximately $413.0 million during fiscal 2001 as
compared to fiscal 2000. This increase was largely due to
stronger sales in Europe and Japan.

Weakness in international currencies during
fiscal 2002 negatively impacted our international revenue growth
by approximately $14.0 million as compared to the impact of
average international currency rates during fiscal 2001. The
negative impact during fiscal 2001 as compared to the impact of
average international currency rates during fiscal 2000 was
approximately $43.8 million.

Product
Returns

We estimate and record channel deferrals and
obsolescence reserves to cover exposures related to product
returns. Product returns principally relate to stock balancing
and the replacement of obsolete products, which are offset by
orders of equal or greater value for the current versions of the
products. The mix of products returned from our
distributors/resellers as compared to products sold to our
distributors/resellers does not impact our gross margin, as our
gross margin is materially consistent across our various product
families. Changes in the level of product returns and related
product returns provision are generally offset by a change in
the level of gross revenue. As a result, the product returns
provision did not have a material impact on reported net
revenues in any period presented.

Gross Margin

Gross margin represents net revenues less cost of
revenues. Cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing
expenses, costs for producing manuals and CDs, packaging costs,
royalties paid to third parties under publishing contracts,
costs of consulting services, technical support costs and
amortization and write-off of acquired product rights.

Gross margin was approximately 82%, 85% and 84%
of net revenues during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The decline in gross margin during fiscal 2002 as compared to
fiscal 2001 was mostly driven by increased amortization of
acquired product rights from our acquisition of AXENT and
technical support costs as a result of an increase in related
enterprise sales. In addition, consulting service costs included
in costs of revenue increased along with the related increase in
consulting service revenues. This contributed to the decline in
gross margin during fiscal 2002, as consulting services
typically have lower margins than our products.

Gross margin improved slightly during fiscal 2001
as compared to fiscal 2000 due primarily to higher margins
associated with the increase in enterprise related sales and
cost savings achieved in reduced packaging costs.

Acquired Product Rights

Acquired product rights are comprised of
purchased product rights, technologies and workforce-in-place.
During fiscal 2001, we recorded approximately $86.2 million in
acquired product rights in connection with our acquisition of
AXENT, and during fiscal 2000, we recorded approximately
$11.3 million in acquired product rights in connection with
other acquisitions.

During fiscal 2002, amortization of acquired
product rights totaled approximately $32.2 million, of
which $31.1 million and $1.1 million was recorded in
cost of revenues and income (net of expense) from sale of
technologies and product lines, respectively. During fiscal 2001
and 2000, amortization of acquired product rights totaled
$17.3 million and $9.7 million, respectively, and was
recorded in cost of revenues. Acquired product rights, with the
exception of workforce-in-place, will be amortized over the next
four years. Effective



April 1, 2002, the net balance of
workforce-in-place of approximately $3.9 million, net of a
deferred tax liability, will be included with goodwill and will
no longer be amortized but will be subject to an annual
impairment test.

For further discussion on acquired product rights
and related amortization, see Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Research and Development
    Expenses

We charge research and development expenditures
to operations as incurred. As a percentage of net revenues,
research and development expenses remained flat at 15% during
fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000.

Although research and development expenses
remained flat as a percentage of net revenues, absolute dollars
increased 29% to approximately $164.0 million during fiscal
2002 from $126.7 million during fiscal 2001. The increase
was primarily a result of salary increases and other employee
related expenses, infrastructure related expenditures and a full
year of AXENT related research and development expenses as
compared to approximately three months during fiscal 2001.

Research and development expenses increased 17%
to approximately $126.7 million during fiscal 2001 from
$108.4 million during fiscal 2000. The increase was a
result of Enterprise Security segment hiring, salary increases
and other employee related expenses and AXENT related research
and development expenses that were included from the date of
acquisition. This increase was partially offset by the lack of
expenses during fiscal 2001 associated with the divested Visual
Café and ACT! product lines and the patent claim
settlements in the Consumer Products segment.

Sales and Marketing Expenses

Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of
net revenues were 40% during fiscal 2002 and were flat at 41%
during fiscal 2001 and 2000. Sales and marketing expenses were
approximately $428.5 million, $350.0 million and
$306.8 million during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The absolute dollar increase in sales and
marketing expenses during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001
was primarily related to Enterprise Security segment hiring,
salary and commission increases, outside services for
consultants and contractors, infrastructure related
expenditures, and a full year of AXENT related sales and
marketing expenses as compared to approximately three months
during fiscal 2001.

The absolute dollar increase in sales and
marketing expenses during fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000
was also due to increased Enterprise Security segment hiring,
increase in salaries, commissions and other performance based
compensation, and AXENT related sales and marketing expenses
which were included from the date of acquisition.

General and Administrative
    Expenses

General and administrative expenses as a
percentage of net revenues remained flat at 5% during fiscal
2002 and 2001 and were 6% during fiscal 2000.

General and administrative expenses were
approximately $53.9 million, $44.8 million and
$42.2 million during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The absolute dollar increase in general and
administrative expenses during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal
2001 was primarily due to a full year of AXENT related general
and administrative expenses as compared to approximately three
months during fiscal 2001, salary increases, legal fees,
infrastructure related expenditures and bad debt expense, offset
by a reduction of other general and administrative expenses.

General and administrative expenses in absolute
dollars increased during fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000,
primarily due to an increase in salary related expenses and
other general and administrative expenses, offset by a reduction
in bad debt expenses.



Amortization of Goodwill and Other
    Intangibles from Acquisitions

Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles
from acquisitions increased 176% to approximately
$196.8 million during fiscal 2002 from $71.3 million
during fiscal 2001, and increased 299% to approximately
$71.3 million during fiscal 2001 from $17.9 million
during fiscal 2000. These increases were related primarily to
the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated
with the acquisition of AXENT in December 2000.

Effective April 1, 2002, the net balance of
goodwill of approximately $521.9 million will no longer be
amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test. As a
result, amortization charges will decrease significantly going
forward; however, our operating results may be subject to
increased volatility as a result of periodic goodwill impairment
charges. Other intangibles from acquisitions will continue to be
amortized over their useful lives.

Acquired In-Process Research and
    Development Expenses

We recorded no acquired in-process research and
development charges during fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2001, we
acquired AXENT and during fiscal 2000, we acquired URLabs and
L-3 Network Security’s operations. We wrote off
approximately $22.3 million and $4.3 million of
acquired in-process research and development associated with
these acquisitions during fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively.
These write-offs were necessary because the acquired
technologies had not yet reached technological feasibility and
there were no alternative uses.

The efforts required to develop the acquired
in-process technology principally related to the completion of
all planning, design, development and testing activities that
are necessary to establish that the product or service can be
produced to meet its design specifications including features,
functions and performance. We expect the acquired in-process
technology to be developed into commercially feasible products.
However, there are no assurances that this will occur. If we
fail to complete these products in their entirety, or in a
timely manner, we may not continue to attract new users, we may
be unable to retain our existing users and the value of the
other intangible assets may become impaired.

We determined the fair value of the acquired
in-process technology for each of the purchases by estimating
the projected cash flows related to these projects, including
the cost to complete the acquired in-process technologies and
future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the
products. We discounted the resulting cash flows back to their
net present values. We based the net cash flows from such
projects on our analysis of the respective markets and estimates
of revenues and operating profits related to these projects.

A valuation specialist used our estimates to
establish the amount of acquired in-process research and
development to be written off for these acquisitions during
fiscal 2001 and 2000. Actual spending on these product
development projects since our acquisition of the companies
discussed below did not differ materially from the original
assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings.

AXENT

The in-process technology acquired in the AXENT
acquisition consisted primarily of research and development
related to the next generation of ESM, Intruder Alert, Raptor
Firewall, Webthority and other projects. AXENT’s research
and development was focused on providing more robust features in
its development of these next generation products. We have added
these projects to our product offerings, with the exception of
Webthority, which was divested with our web access management
product line in August 2001.

L-3 Network Security

The in-process technology acquired in the L-3
Network Security purchase consisted primarily of research and
development related to the next generation of Retriever and
Expert. We have integrated this technology into our
vulnerability management products.



URLabs

The in-process technology acquired in the URLabs
purchase consisted primarily of research and development related
to the next generation of URLabs’ two main products, I-Gear
and Mail-Gear, which have been added to our product offerings.

Restructuring, Site Closures and Other
    Expenses

Restructuring, site closures and other expenses
were approximately $20.4 million, $3.7 million and
$9.0 million during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. During fiscal 2002, we incurred expenses related
to consolidating smaller sites into a larger facility in Newport
News, Virginia, consolidating most of our United Kingdom
facilities to Maidenhead, UK, consolidating our European support
functions by moving our Leiden, Netherlands facility to Dublin,
Ireland and relocating our North American support group to
Springfield, Oregon. As a result, we recorded approximately
$17.8 million for exit costs, including $12.8 million
in rent and related exit costs remaining on the abandoned
facilities and $5.0 million in related abandoned fixed
asset and leasehold improvement write-offs. In addition, we
recorded approximately $2.6 million for costs of severance,
related benefits and outplacement services, as we reorganized
various operating functions, including former AXENT operations,
and reduced our workforce by 87 employees. During the June
2002 quarter, we will record costs of severance, related
benefits and outplacement services, as a result of the
relocation of our Leiden, Netherlands operations to Dublin,
Ireland.

During fiscal 2001, we reorganized various
operating functions, including a portion of our operations in
Toronto. We reduced our workforce by 60 employees and ten
members of our senior management, and as a result, we recorded
approximately $3.7 million for costs of severance, related
benefits, outplacement services and abandonment of certain
equipment.

During fiscal 2000, we reduced our operations and
realigned our business units, including operations in Melville
and Toronto and our Internet Tools business unit. We reduced our
workforce by 154 employees and five members of our senior
management, and as a result, we recorded approximately
$9.7 million for severance, related benefits, outplacement
services and abandonment of certain facilities and equipment.

For further discussion on restructuring, site
closures and other expenses, see Note 13 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Litigation Judgment

During the March 2002 quarter, we accrued
litigation expenses of approximately $3.1 million for
post-judgment interest and other costs related to a judgment by
a Canadian court on a decade-old copyright action assumed by us
as a result of our acquisition of Delrina Corporation. For
further discussion on our current litigation, see Note 16
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this
Form 10-K.

Interest Income, Interest Expense and Other
    Income (Expense)

Interest income was approximately
$31.7 million, $33.3 million and $13.4 million
during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Although
interest income was relatively flat during fiscal 2002 and
fiscal 2001, average cash balances were higher during fiscal
2002 as compared to fiscal 2001, which was offset by a decrease
in average interest rates. Interest income increased
significantly during fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 due
to higher average cash balances during fiscal 2001.

Interest expense was approximately
$9.2 million during fiscal 2002, nearly all of which was
related to the issuance of $600.0 million of 3% convertible
subordinated debentures in October 2001. Interest expense was
not significant during fiscal 2001 and 2000.

Other expense, net of approximately $627,000
during fiscal 2002 was primarily comprised of net losses from
non-functional currency transactions. Other expense, net was
approximately $22.5 million during fiscal 2001 and
consisted primarily of impairment charges on our equity
investments. Other income, net was



approximately $1.3 million during fiscal
2000 and was primarily comprised of net gains from
non-functional currency transactions.

Income, Net of Expense, from Sale of
    Technologies and Product Lines

Income, net of expense, from sale of technologies
and product lines was approximately $15.5 million,
$20.4 million, and $107.4 million during fiscal 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively. During fiscal 2002 and 2001,
income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product
lines was related primarily to royalties from Interact Commerce
Corporation, who subsequently merged with The Sage
Group plc, as a result of the divestiture of our ACT!
product line in December 1999.

Income, net of expense, from sale of technologies
and product lines during fiscal 2000 related primarily to gains
of $68.5 million and $18.3 million on the divestiture
of our Visual Café and ACT! product lines, respectively, in
December 1999. In addition, income, net of expense, from sale of
technologies and product lines during fiscal 2000 included
$14.7 million related to payments from JetForm Corporation,
associated with our sale of certain software products,
technologies and tangible assets to JetForm during fiscal 1997,
and $5.0 million related to royalties from Interact.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate on income before one-time
charges (acquired in-process research and development,
restructuring, site closures and other expenses), goodwill
amortization expense and gain on sale of product lines was 32%
during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000. Our fiscal 2002, 2001 and
2000 effective rates were lower than the U.S. federal and state
combined statutory rate primarily due to a lower statutory tax
rate on income generated by our Irish operations.

Our effective tax rate on income before taxes was
162%, 55% and 34% during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The higher effective tax rate during fiscal 2002
and 2001 reflects the non-deductibility of acquired in-process
research and development and substantially all of the goodwill
amortization. In addition, during fiscal 2000, tax was provided
on the gain on sale of product lines at an effective tax rate of
34%. This rate is lower than the U.S. federal and state
combined statutory rate because a portion of the gain is
attributable to our Irish operations and accordingly subject to
a lower Irish tax rate.

Realization of approximately $46.0 million
of our net deferred tax asset as of March 31, 2002 is
dependent primarily upon future U.S. taxable income of
$131.0 million. Realization of the remaining
$12.0 million of our net deferred tax asset as of
March 31, 2002 is dependent in part on future taxable
income in certain foreign jurisdictions and on our
implementation of tax planning strategies. We believe it is more
likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be
realized based on historical earnings and expected levels of
future taxable income as well as the implementation of tax
planning strategies.

Levels of future taxable income are subject to
the various risks and uncertainties discussed in the Business
Risk Factors set forth in this Item 7. Additional valuation
allowance against net deferred tax assets may be necessary if it
is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net
deferred tax assets will not be realized. We will assess the
need for additional valuation allowance on a quarterly basis.

We project our effective tax rate to be 32% for
fiscal 2003 as a result of the discontinuation of goodwill
amortization (see

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

for
further discussion). This projection, however, is subject to
change due to potential tax law changes and fluctuations in the
geographic allocation of earnings.

Selected Pro Forma Financial
    Data

For comparative purposes, the following table
displays, on a pro forma basis, our results of operations as if
the acquisition of AXENT had occurred at the beginning of fiscal
2000 and excluding all acquisition related amortization and
one-time charges and the operating results of the divested
Visual Café and ACT! product



lines. These measures are not in accordance with,
or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles,
or GAAP, and may be different from pro forma measures used by
other companies.

The following items represent the difference
between the pro forma financial data and the related GAAP
financial data in the Consolidated Statements of Operations:

•

During fiscal 2001 and 2000, pro forma net
    revenues include AXENT net revenues of approximately
    $90.6 million and $80.9 million, respectively, as if
    the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2000.

•

During fiscal 2002, the pro forma net income
    excludes all acquisition related amortization and one-time
    charges of approximately $249.7 million (tax benefit of
    $20.8 million). During fiscal 2001, the pro forma net
    income includes AXENT’s net loss of approximately
    $6.2 million and excludes all acquisition related
    amortization and one-time charges of $139.3 million (tax
    benefit of $12.8 million). During fiscal 2000, the pro
    forma net income includes AXENT’s net income of
    approximately $5.0 million and excludes all acquisition
    related amortization and one-time charges of $40.9 million
    (tax benefit of $10.0 million) and the operating results of
    the divested Visual Café and ACT! product lines of
    $63.5 million.

•

During fiscal 2002, shares used to compute pro
    forma net income per share (diluted) include approximately
    7.6 million shares issuable from assumed exercise of
    options and 7.6 million shares issuable upon conversion of
    the 3% convertible subordinated debentures issued in
    October 2001. Correspondingly, the numerator used to compute pro
    forma net income (diluted) during fiscal 2002 excludes the
    interest expense of approximately $6.2 million from the 3%
    convertible subordinated debentures, net of income tax. During
    fiscal 2001 and 2000, shares used to compute pro forma net
    income per share (diluted) include approximately
    20.6 million and 27.6 million shares, respectively,
    which represents the number of Symantec shares that would have
    been exchanged for AXENT’s weighted number of common shares
    outstanding for the respective periods.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal source of liquidity is our cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investments. Cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments increased
$818.0 million to approximately $1.4 billion at the
end of fiscal 2002 from $557.0 million at the end of fiscal
2001. This increase was largely due to the net proceeds from the
issuance of convertible subordinated debentures of approximately
$584.6 million and from cash provided from operations of
$511.2 million, as well as net proceeds from the exercise
of stock options and sales of common stock through our employee
stock purchase plan. The cash provided by these factors was
partially offset by cash paid to purchase marketable securities
and investments, net of proceeds, of approximately
$721.7 million, and to a lesser extent cash paid to
repurchase common stock and capital expenditures.

Net cash provided by operating activities was
approximately $511.2 million and was comprised of net
non-cash related expenses of $293.2 million and a net
increase of $246.2 million in liabilities, net of a
decrease in assets, offset by a net loss of approximately
$28.2 million.

Net trade accounts receivable decreased
$27.5 million to approximately $89.2 million as of
March 31, 2002 from $116.7 million as of
March 31, 2001. The decrease in accounts receivable was
primarily due to net



revenues being generated more evenly throughout
the March 2002 quarter due primarily to the increase in sales of
consumer products, which resulted in higher cash collections. In
prior quarters, we had generated a larger percentage of net
revenues during the last month of each quarter.

Net cash used in investing activities was
approximately $869.3 million and was comprised primarily of
$721.7 million in net purchases of marketable securities
and investments, and $140.9 million of capital
expenditures, including $62.0 million for the implementation of
Oracle 11i and a CRM system and $25 million in January 2002
and $18 million in November 2001 for land and a building in
Maidenhead, United Kingdom and Dublin, Ireland, respectively.

On January 16, 2001, the Board of Directors
replaced an earlier stock repurchase program with a new
authorization to repurchase up to $700.0 million, not to
exceed 30.0 million shares, of Symantec’s common stock
with no expiration date. During the September 2001 quarter, we
repurchased 9.6 million shares at prices ranging from
$17.78 to $24.50 per share, for an aggregate amount of
approximately $204.4 million. During the March 2001
quarter, we repurchased 10.0 million shares at prices
ranging from $23.04 to $25.58 per share, for an aggregate amount
of approximately $244.4 million.

On October 24, 2001, we completed a private
offering of $600.0 million of 3% convertible subordinated
debentures due November 1, 2006, the net proceeds of which
were approximately $584.6 million. The debentures are
convertible into shares of Symantec’s common stock by the
holders at any time before maturity at a conversion price of
$34.14 per share, subject to certain adjustments. We may redeem
the notes on or after November 5, 2004, at a redemption
price of 100.75% of stated principal during the period
November 5, 2004 through October 31, 2005 and 100%
thereafter. Interest will be paid semi-annually, commencing
May 1, 2002. We intend to use the net proceeds of the
offering for general corporate purposes, including working
capital, potential acquisitions, stock repurchases and
investments in our infrastructure.

The following table displays our contractual
obligations as of March 31, 2002:

The above table assumes that the convertible
subordinated debentures will be paid in cash upon maturity and
excludes the balance of our current liabilities.

We believe that existing cash and short-term
investments, cash generated from operating results and cash from
the subordinated convertible debenture offering will be
sufficient to fund operations for at least the next year.

Synthetic Leases

We currently have two real estate leasing
arrangements that we have classified as operating leases.

One of the lease arrangements is for two existing
office buildings in Cupertino, California. Lease payments for
these facilities are based on the three-month LIBOR in effect at
the beginning of each fiscal quarter plus a specified margin. We
have the right to acquire the related properties at any time
during the seven-year lease period ending February 1, 2006.
If, at the end of the lease term we do not renew the lease,
purchase the properties or arrange for a third party to purchase
the properties, we may be obligated to the lessor for all or
some portion of an amount up to the guaranteed residual amount
of approximately $66.0 million, representing approximately
84% of the lessor’s purchase price of the property.

On March 30, 2001, we entered into a master
lease agreement for land and the construction of two office
buildings, one in Newport News, Virginia, effective June 6,
2001, and another in Springfield, Oregon, effective



April 6, 2001. Our lease payments will vary
based on one-, three- or six-month LIBOR plus a specified
margin. We have the right to acquire the related properties at
any time during the six and one-half year lease period ending
September 28, 2007. We moved into the Oregon facility
immediately after the end of the December 2001 quarter and into
the Virginia facility in April 2002. If, at the end of the lease
term we do not renew the lease, purchase the properties or
arrange for a third party to purchase the properties, we may be
obligated to the lessor for all or some portion of an amount up
to the guaranteed residual amount representing approximately 85%
of the lessor’s ultimate purchase price of the properties,
up to a maximum amount of approximately $55.1 million as of
March 31, 2002.

As security for each of these arrangements, we
are required to maintain a cash collateral balance, which was
approximately $124.3 million as of March 31, 2002. We
are required to invest the cash collateral in U.S. Treasury
securities or certificates of deposit with specified lenders and
maturities not to exceed two to three years. In accordance with
the lease terms, these funds are not available to meet operating
cash requirements. As of March 31, 2002, the investments
related to the California lease totaled approximately $77.4
million and the investments related to the Oregon and Virginia
leases totaled $46.9 million. These amounts were classified
as non-current restricted investments within the consolidated
financial statements.

In addition, we are obligated to maintain certain
financial covenants including a minimum cash balance, tangible
net worth and quarterly earnings before income tax, depreciation
and amortization, or EBITDA, and maximum debt and senior debt to
EBITDA ratios. Future acquisitions, financing activities or
operating losses may cause us to be in violation of these
financial covenants. In the event of default, we may be required
to release the cash collateral and take possession of the
buildings. As of March 31, 2002, we were in compliance with
all of the above financial covenants.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board, or FASB, issued SFAS No. 141,

Business
Combinations,

and No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,

effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2001. SFAS No. 141 requires that all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Under
SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have
indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject
to an annual impairment test. Other intangibles will continue to
be amortized over their useful lives. We will adopt SFAS
No. 142 in our first quarter of fiscal 2003. Upon adoption
of SFAS No. 142, we will stop the amortization of goodwill
and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives with a net
carrying value of approximately $525.9 million, net of a
deferred tax liability, as of March 31, 2002. As a result
of the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill existing
as of March 31, 2002 and excluding the impact of potential
impairment charges, the application of SFAS No. 142 is
expected to result in an increase in our results of operations
of approximately $198.4 million during fiscal 2003. During
the first six months of fiscal 2003, we will perform the first
of the required impairment tests of goodwill and intangible
assets deemed to have indefinite lives as of April 1, 2002,
using the two-step process required under SFAS 142. We have not
yet determined what effect these tests will have on our earnings
and financial position.

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 144,

Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets.

SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS
No. 121,

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of,

and
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment
and disposal of long-lived assets. We will adopt this statement
on April 1, 2002. Adoption of this statement is not
expected to have a material impact on our financial position or
results of operations.

The lessors associated with lease agreements
relating to certain of our facilities, described under

Synthetic Leases

above, are special purpose entities or
equivalent structures. Presently, we account for these leases as
operating leases, while the special purpose entities or
equivalent structures own and account for the leased assets and
related liabilities in their records. The FASB has indicated
that it will, prior to June 30, 2002, issue proposed new
rules on accounting for “Entities That Lack Sufficient
Independent Economic Substance”, including special purpose
entities, in the form of an Interpretation to SFAS No. 94,

Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries,

and
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,

Consolidated
Financial Statements.



Based on public comments from the FASB to date,
the proposed interpretation will provide guidance for
determining when an entity (such as us), the Primary
Beneficiary, should consolidate another entity, a special
purpose entity or equivalent structure (such as the lessor),
that functions to support the activities of the Primary
Beneficiary. The expected proposed Interpretation may result in
us having to consolidate the operating results of the special
purpose entities and equivalent structures, which are the
lessors under the aforementioned operating lease agreements. The
effective date of these proposed new rules on our current
operating leases could be as early as the beginning of our
fiscal year 2004, and sooner on any new leases entered into
after the new rules’ effective date which utilize special
purpose entities or equivalent structures.

Business Risk Factors

There is uncertainty as to whether or not we
will be able to sustain the growth rates in sales of our
products, particularly in consumer antivirus protection
products.

During the second half of
fiscal 2002, we experienced a higher than expected rate of
growth in sales of our consumer antivirus protection products,
and we may not be able to sustain this high growth rate on a
consistent basis going forward. We believe that consumer
antivirus sales were spurred by a number of factors, including
outbreaks of the well-publicized Code Red and Nimda viruses and
a reaction from the September 11 terrorist attacks. In
addition, although the release of new operating systems
incorporating security and virus protection features,
particularly past releases of Microsoft Windows, have increased
competition in our market and had a harmful effect on demand,
the recent release of Windows XP may have actually spurred
additional sales. These positive factors are likely to weaken
over time, and it is possible that growth rates in sales of
antivirus protection products may decline. These factors may
have also had a short-term effect on growth in enterprise
security products, and we note that sales of our enterprise
security products decreased from the third to the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2002. If sales of these products decline faster than
expected, our stock price may be harmed.

We have grown, and may continue to grow,
through acquisitions, which give rise to a number of risks that
could have adverse consequences for our future operating
results.

We have made six acquisitions
since March 1999, with our acquisition of AXENT Technologies,
Inc. in December 2000 being the largest. Although we cannot
assure you that we will be successful in completing them, we
will likely pursue future acquisitions. Integrating acquired
businesses has been and will continue to be a complex, time
consuming and expensive process. To integrate acquired
businesses, we must implement our technology systems in the
acquired operations and assimilate and manage the personnel of
the acquired operations. Our past acquisitions have given rise
to substantial amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets
that have been amortized or written off in subsequent years.
Future acquisitions may result in substantial amounts of
goodwill that will be subject to an annual impairment test and
other intangible assets that will be amortized, subject to an
annual impairment test or written off. In addition, a number of
our acquisitions have resulted in substantial restructuring and
other related expenses and write-offs of acquired in-process
research and development costs, and this also may occur as a
result of future acquisitions. Further, we may need to issue
equity or incur additional debt to finance future acquisitions,
which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders or could
increase our leverage. Any of these and other factors could harm
our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from
acquired operations or to realize other anticipated benefits of
an acquisition. Further, the difficulties of integrating
acquired businesses could disrupt our ongoing business, distract
our management focus from other opportunities and challenges,
and increase our expenses and working capital requirements.

Demand for our products is subject to seasonal
trends.

Although there is no assurance
this trend will continue, our sales of consumer products over
the last six years have been seasonal, with higher sales
generally in our December and March quarters. In addition, we
anticipate that sales of enterprise security products may be
higher in the March quarter in the future, as our sales force
attempts to close transactions before the end of our fiscal
year. To the extent seasonality makes it more difficult to
predict our revenues and value our business, our stock price may
suffer and the volatility of our stock may increase.

Our increased sales of enterprise-wide site
licenses may increase fluctuations in our financial results.

Sales of enterprise-wide site licenses
through our Enterprise Security segment have been increasing and
now represent a major portion of our business. This enterprise
market has significantly different characteristics than the
consumer market and different skills and resources are needed to
penetrate this market. As our enterprise



segment becomes more important to our business
and our product strategy continues to develop, we may face new
competitors or new levels of competition. Enterprise licensing
arrangements involve a longer sales cycle than sales through
other distribution channels, require greater investment of
resources in establishing the enterprise relationship and can
sometimes result in lower operating margins. The timing of the
execution of volume licenses, or their nonrenewal or
renegotiation by large customers, could cause our results of
operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and
could have a material adverse impact on our results of
operations.

Economic and political conditions and
conditions affecting the network security market in particular
may have a negative impact on our revenues and
margins.

The market for our products
depends on economic conditions affecting the broader network
security, Internet infrastructure and related markets. More
generally, the slowdown in the U.S. economy may hurt consumer
demand for our services. On the enterprise side, the continued
slowdown in corporate earnings and tightening of corporate
budgets may cause potential customers to delay or cancel
security projects, reduce their overall or security-specific
information technology budgets, or reduce or cancel orders for
our products. Further, in this environment, customers may
experience financial difficulty, cease operations or fail to
budget for the purchase of our products. This, in turn, may lead
to longer sales cycles, delays in payment and collection, and
price pressures, causing us to realize lower revenues and
margins. In addition, the terrorist acts of September 11,
2001 created an uncertain economic and political environment in
many parts of the world, and we cannot predict the impact of
these events, or of any related military action, on our
customers or business.

Piracy of our software may have a significant
impact on our net revenues.

While we
are unable to determine the exact extent of piracy of our
software products, software piracy may depress our net revenues.
While this would adversely affect domestic revenue, revenue loss
is believed to be even more significant outside of the United
States, particularly in countries where laws are less protective
of intellectual property rights. We engage in efforts to educate
consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and to
educate lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where
intellectual property rights are protected and we cooperate with
the Business Software Alliance in their efforts to combat
piracy. However, such continued efforts may not be successful in
preventing piracy of our products from occurring.

We are in the process of making substantial
changes to our information systems that could disrupt our
business.

The information systems that
supported our accounting, finance, order management and
manufacturing systems were based on Oracle 10.7, and many of the
business applications used in other aspects of our business have
been tightly coupled with Oracle 10.7. Oracle has released a new
version, 11i, and has announced that support for Oracle 10.7
will be discontinued after June 2002. In addition, as our
business has grown, we have developed needs for an increasingly
robust customer relationship management, or CRM, system. During
fiscal 2002, we began implementing Oracle 11i and a new CRM
system. Oracle 11i implementation occurred in the December 2001
quarter for the United States operations and should be completed
by the June 2002 quarter for the Europe, Middle East and Africa
operations. The first two phases of the CRM implementation
occurred in June 2001 and February 2002, with the remaining
implementation phases scheduled for the first and third quarters
of fiscal 2003. These types of transitions frequently prove
disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise and may
cause us to incur higher costs than we anticipate. Failure to
manage a smooth transition to the new systems and the ongoing
operations and support of the new systems could materially harm
our business operations.



Our markets are competitive and our operating
results and financial condition could be adversely affected if
we are unable to anticipate or react to this competition.

Our markets are competitive. If we are
unable to anticipate or react to this competition, our operating
results could be adversely affected by reducing our sales or the
prices we can charge for our products. In the recent past, many
of our competitors have significantly lowered the price of their
products and we may have to do the same to remain competitive.
Our ability to remain competitive depends, in part, on our
ability to enhance our products or develop new products that are
compatible with new hardware and operating systems. We have no
control over, and limited insight into, development efforts by
third parties with respect to new hardware and operating systems
and we may not respond effectively or timely to such changes in
the market. In addition, we have limited resources and we must
make strategic decisions as to the best allocation of our
resources to position ourselves for changes in our markets. We
may from time to time allocate resources to projects or markets
that do not develop as rapidly or fully as we expect. We may
fail to allocate resources to third party products, to markets
or to business models that are more successful than we
anticipate.

Our software products and web site may be
subject to intentional disruption.

Although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to
prevent intentional disruptions, such as software viruses
specifically designed to impede the performance of our products,
we expect to be an ongoing target of such disruptions.
Similarly, experienced computer programmers, or hackers, may
attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our
web site and misappropriate proprietary information or cause
interruptions of our services. Our activities could be
substantially disrupted and our reputation, and future sales,
harmed if these efforts are successful.

We face risks associated with our foreign
operations.

A significant portion of
our net revenues, manufacturing costs and operating expenses
result from transactions outside of the United States, often in
foreign currencies. As a result, our future operating results
could be negatively affected by fluctuations in currency
exchange rates and general uncertainty with each country’s
political and economic structure. In addition, governmental
regulation of imports or exports or our failure to obtain any
required export approval of our technologies, particularly our
encryption technologies, could impede our international sales.
In light of recent terrorist activity, governments could enact
additional regulation or restrictions on the use, import or
export of encryption technologies. Additional regulation of
encryption technology could delay or prevent the acceptance and
use of encryption products and public networks for secure
communications. This might decrease demand for our products and
services.

Introduction of new operating systems may
adversely affect our financial results and stock price.

The inclusion of security, remote
access or virus protection tools in new operating systems and
hardware packages could adversely affect our sales. For example,
the inclusion of features by Microsoft in future editions of
Windows which directly compete with our products may decrease or
delay the demand for certain of our products, including those
currently under development. Additionally, as hardware vendors
incorporate additional server-based network management and
security tools into network operating systems, the demand may
decrease for some of our products, including those currently
under development.

Our earnings and stock price are subject to
significant fluctuations.

Due to many
factors, including those noted in this section, our earnings and
stock price have been and may continue to be subject to
significant volatility. There have been previous quarters in
which we have experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings
from levels expected by securities analysts and investors, which
have had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the
trading price of our common stock. This may occur again in the
future. Any such volatility may make it more difficult for us to
raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve
issuances of our common stock or securities convertible or
exercisable into our common stock.



Fluctuations in our quarterly operating
results have affected our stock price in the past and could
affect our stock price in the future.

If our quarterly operating results
fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors, the
trading price of shares of our common stock and of the
debentures could be negatively affected. Our quarterly operating
results have varied substantially in the past and may vary
substantially in the future depending upon a number of factors,
including:

In addition to the foregoing factors, the risk of
quarterly fluctuations is increased by the fact that a
significant portion of our net revenues has historically been
generated during the last month of each fiscal quarter. Most
resellers tend to make a majority of their purchases at the end
of a fiscal quarter. In addition, many enterprise customers
negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter. In part,
this is because these two groups are able, or believe that they
are able, to negotiate lower prices and more favorable terms at
that time. Our reliance on a large portion of revenue occurring
at the end of the quarter and the increase in the dollar value
of transactions that occur at the end of a quarter can result in
increased uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues. Due to
this end-of-period buying pattern, forecasts may not be
achieved, either because expected sales do not occur or because
they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable
to us. In addition, these factors increase the chances that our
results could diverge from the expectations of investors and
analysts.

We must effectively adapt to changes in the
dynamic technological environment.

We
are increasingly focused on the Internet security market, which,
in turn is dependent on further acceptance and increased use of
the Internet. The following critical issues concerning the use
of the Internet remain unresolved and may affect the market for
our products and the use of the Internet as a medium to
distribute or support our software products and the
functionality of some of our products:

In addition, new technologies, such as non
PC-based Internet access devices and handheld organizers are
gaining acceptance. We must adapt to these changing
technological demands. If we are unable to timely assimilate
changes brought about by the Internet and non PC-based
environments, our future net revenues and operating results
could be adversely affected.

The results of our research and development
efforts are uncertain.

We will need to
incur significant research and development expenditures in
future periods as we strive to remain competitive. The length of
our product development cycle has generally been greater than we
originally expected and we are likely to experience delays in
future product development. In addition, a portion of our
development efforts have not been technologically successful and
certain products have not achieved market acceptance. As a
result, the



products we are currently developing or may
develop in the future may not be technologically successful,
achieve market acceptance or compete effectively with products
of our competitors.

We are dependent upon certain distribution
channels.

A large portion of our sales
is made through the retail distribution channel, which is
subject to events that cause unpredictability in consumer
demand. This increases the risk that we may not plan effectively
for the future, which could result in adverse operating results
in future periods. Our retail distribution customers also carry
our competitors’ products. These retail distributors may
have limited capital to invest in inventory. Their decisions to
purchase our products are partly a function of pricing, terms
and special promotions offered by our competitors and other
factors that we do not control and cannot predict. Our
agreements with retail distributors are generally nonexclusive
and may be terminated by them or by us without cause. We would
be adversely affected if companies in our chain of distributors
chose to increase purchases from our competition relative to the
amount they purchase from us.

Some distributors and resellers have experienced
financial difficulties in the past. Distributors that account
for a significant portion of our sales may experience financial
difficulties in the future. If these distributors do experience
financial difficulties and we are unable to move their
inventories to other distributors, we may experience reduced
sales or increased write-offs, which would adversely affect our
operating results.

Product returns may negatively affect our net
revenues.

Product returns can occur
when we introduce upgrades and new versions of products or when
distributors or retailers have excess inventories, subject to
various contractual limitations. Our return policy allows
distributors, subject to these contractual limitations, to
return purchased products in exchange for new products or for
credit towards future purchases. End-users may return our
products through dealers and distributors or to us directly for
a full refund within a reasonably short period from the date of
purchase. Future returns could exceed the reserves we have
established for product returns, which could have a material
adverse effect on our operating results.

We depend on internal communications systems
that may be disrupted.

Our order
management and product shipping centers are geographically
dispersed. A business disruption could occur as a result of
natural disasters or the interruption in service by
communications carriers. If our communications between these
centers are disrupted, particularly at the end of a fiscal
quarter, we may suffer an unexpected shortfall in net revenues
and a resulting adverse impact on our operating results.
Communications and Internet connectivity disruptions may also
cause delays in customer access to our Internet-based services
or product sales.

We are subject to litigation that could
adversely affect our financial
results.

From time to time, we may be
subject to claims that we have infringed the intellectual
property rights of others, or other product liability claims, or
other claims incidental to our business. We are currently
involved in a number of lawsuits. We intend to defend all of
these lawsuits vigorously. However, it is possible that we could
suffer an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases.
Depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable
resolutions of these lawsuits, our future results of operations
or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a
particular period.

Although infringement claims may ultimately prove
to be without merit, they are expensive to defend and may
consume our resources or divert our attention from day-to-day
operations. If a third party alleges that we have infringed
their intellectual property rights, we may choose to litigate
the claim and/or seek an appropriate license from the third
party. If we engage in litigation and the third party is found
to have a valid patent claim against us and a license is not
available on reasonable terms, our business, operating results
and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

The trend toward consolidation in the software
industry could impede our ability to compete effectively.

Consolidation is underway among
companies in the software industry as firms seek to offer more
extensive suites of software products and broader arrays of
software solutions. Changes resulting from this consolidation
may negatively impact our competitive condition. In addition, to
the extent that we seek to expand our product lines and skills
and capacity through acquisitions, the trend toward
consolidation may result in our encountering competition, and
paying higher prices, for acquired businesses.



We must attract and retain personnel in a
competitive marketplace.

We believe
that our future success will depend in part on our ability to
recruit and retain highly skilled management, marketing and
technical personnel. To accomplish this, we believe that we must
provide personnel with a competitive compensation package,
including stock options. Increases in shares available for
issuance under our stock options plans require stockholder
approval in many cases, and institutional stockholders, or
stockholders generally, may not approve future increases.
Additionally, there are several proposals in the Congress and in
the accounting industry to require corporations to include a
compensation expense in their statement of operations relating
to the issuance of employee stock options. If such a measure is
approved, we may decide to issue fewer stock options. As a
result, we may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain
necessary personnel.

Our intellectual property and proprietary
rights may not be adequately protected from all unauthorized
uses.

We regard our software and
underlying technology as proprietary. We seek to protect our
proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality
agreements and copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret
laws. Third parties may copy aspects of our products or
otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without
authorization or develop similar technology independently. All
of our products are protected by copyright laws, and we have a
number of patents and patent applications pending. We may not
achieve the desired protection from, and third parties may
design around, our patents. In addition, existing copyright laws
afford limited practical protection. Furthermore, the laws of
some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection
of our proprietary rights as the laws of the United States, and
we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products. Any legal
action that we may bring to protect proprietary information
could be expensive and may distract management from day-to-day
operations.

Our products are complex and are operated in a
wide variety of computer configurations, which could result in
errors or product failures.

Because we
offer very complex products, undetected errors, failures or bugs
may occur when they are first introduced or when new versions
are released. Our products often are installed and used in
large-scale computing environments with different operating
systems, system management software and equipment and networking
configurations, which may cause errors or failures in our
products or may expose undetected errors, failures or bugs in
our products. In the past, we have discovered software errors,
failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after
their introduction and have experienced delays or lost revenues
during the period required to correct these errors. Our
customers’ computer environments are often characterized by
a wide variety of standard and non-standard configurations that
make pre-release testing for programming or compatibility errors
very difficult and time-consuming. Despite testing by us and by
others, errors, failures or bugs may not be found in new
products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments.
Errors, failures or bugs in products released by us could result
in negative publicity, product returns, loss of or delay in
market acceptance of our products or claims by customers or
others. In addition, if an actual or perceived breach of network
security occurs in one of our end customer’s security
systems, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our
products, the market perception of the effectiveness of our
products could be harmed. Because the techniques used by
computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change
frequently and generally are not recognized until launched
against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these
techniques. Alleviating any of these problems could require
significant expenditures of our capital and resources and could
cause interruptions, delays or cessation of our product
licensing, which could cause us to lose existing or potential
customers and would adversely affect results of operations.

Most of our license agreements with customers
contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential
product liability claims. It is possible, however, that these
provisions may not prove effective in limiting our liability.

Increased utilization and costs of our
technical support services may adversely affect our financial
results.

Like many companies in the
software industry, technical support costs comprise a
significant portion of our operating costs and expenses. Over
the short term, we may be unable to respond to fluctuations in
customer demand for support services, including periods of high
customer usage in which delays may be experienced. We also may
be unable to modify the format of our support services to
compete with changes in support services provided by
competitors. Further, customer demand for these services could
cause increases in the costs of providing such services and
adversely affect our operating results.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We do not undertake any specific actions to cover
our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not a party to any
interest rate risk management transactions. We do not purchase
or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

As of March 31, 2002, the fair market value
of our financial instruments with exposure to interest risk was
approximately USD 1.2 billion, Euro 388.0 million, and
CAD 12.5 million. Sensitivity analysis for a six-month
horizon was performed on our floating rate and fixed rate
financial investments and floating rate liabilities. Parallel
shifts in the yield curve of both +/-50 basis points would
result in changes in fair market values for these investments
and floating rate liabilities of less than USD 1.0 million,
less than Euro 1.0 million and less than CAD
1.0 million.

Exchange Rate Sensitivity

We conduct business in 30 international
currencies through our worldwide operations. We have established
a foreign exchange risk management program, utilizing forward
exchange contracts with one fiscal-month duration to offset
various non-functional currency exposures. Under this program,
increases or decreases in the value of our non-functional
currency assets and liabilities are offset by gains and losses
on the forward exchange contracts to mitigate the risk
associated with foreign exchange market fluctuations. We do not
use forward exchange contracts for trading purposes. At the end
of each fiscal month, all non-functional currency assets and
liabilities are revalued using the spot rate of the maturing
forward exchange contracts and the realized and unrealized gains
and losses are included in net income (loss) as a component
of other income (expense).

We believe that the use of forward exchange
contracts should reduce the risks that arise from conducting
business in international markets. We employ established
policies and procedures governing the use of financial
instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. However,
significant changes in exchange rates may still result in
adverse effects on our operating results.

We use sensitivity analyses to quantify the
impact that market risk exposures may have on the fair market
values of our financial instruments. The financial instruments
included in the sensitivity analyses consist of all of our
foreign currency assets and liabilities and all derivative
instruments, principally forward exchange contracts. The
sensitivity analyses assesses the risk of loss in fair market
values from the impact of hypothetical changes of instantaneous,
parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rates yield
curves on market sensitive instruments over a six-month horizon.

As of March 31, 2002, the notional amount of
our forward contracts was approximately USD 239.6 million.
A 10% appreciation or devaluation in foreign currencies would
result in a decrease in the fair value of our forward exchange
contracts by approximately USD 12.5 million and an increase
in the fair value of our forward exchange contracts by USD
11.0 million, respectively.

As of March 31, 2002, the fair value of our
investments in marketable securities denominated in foreign
currencies was approximately USD 345.4 million. A 10%
appreciation or devaluation would result in an increase in the
fair value of our investments by approximately USD
37.1 million and a decrease in the fair value of our
investments by USD 32.8 million, respectively.

Equity Compensation Plans

A summary of our stockholder approved and
non-approved equity compensation plans as of March 31, 2002
was as follows (in thousands, except exercise price):

*

Our 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan contains an
    “evergreen” provision whereby the number of shares
    available for issuance increases automatically on January 1 of
    each year (beginning in 2000) by 1% of our outstanding shares of
    common stock on each immediately preceding December 31
    during the term of the plan, provided that the aggregate number
    of shares issued over the term of the plan does not exceed
    16 million shares.

The total number of shares to be issued upon
exercise does not include approximately 742,000 outstanding
options as of March 31, 2002 that were assumed as part of
various acquisitions. The weighted average exercise price of
these outstanding options was $18.52 as of March 31, 2002.
In connection with these acquisitions, we have only assumed
outstanding options and rights, but not the plans themselves,
and therefore, no further options may be granted under these
acquired-company plans.

Our non-stockholder approved equity compensation
plans include the following:



The following is a description of the material
features of each of these plans:

2001 Non-Qualified Equity Incentive
    Plan

Number of Shares Subject to the
    Plan.

A total of 6.0 million shares of common
stock are authorized and reserved for issuance under the plan.
If an outstanding stock option or award terminates or is
forfeited before the option is exercised or the shares subject
to the award are issued, or if shares granted under the plan but
subject to a right of repurchase by us are forfeited or
repurchased by us, those shares will again be available for
grant and issuance under the plan. As of March 31, 2002,
approximately 2.7 million options were outstanding under
this plan.

Eligibility for Participation.

Options may be granted to employees, officers,
directors, consultants, independent contractors and advisors to
us, or of any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of Symantec as the
board of directors or the compensation committee may determine.
Our employees who are not officers, directors or other persons
subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 must receive at least 50% of all shares that are available
for grant under the plan. A person may be granted more than one
award under the plan.

Terms of Options.

Our compensation committee determines many of the
terms and conditions of each option granted under the plan,
including the number of shares for which the option will be
granted, the exercise price of the option and the periods during
which the option may be exercised. Each option is evidenced by a
stock option agreement in such form as the committee approves
and is subject to the following conditions (as described in
further detail in the plan itself):



•

Corporate
    Transactions:

In the event of a
    dissolution or liquidation, or in the event that we enter into a
    transaction in which we are acquired by merger, sells
    substantially all of its assets, or other similar transaction
    specified in the plan, then all outstanding awards may be
    assumed, converted or replaced by the successor corporation, or
    the successor corporation may substitute equivalent awards or
    provide substantially similar consideration to participants as
    was provided to stockholders. In the event a successor
    corporation fails to assume or substitute options issued under
    the plan in a change of control transaction, all options will
    expire upon a change in control. Additionally, options may be
    issued under the plan in connection with an acquisition in order
    to substitute or assume options issued by another company.

Term and Amendment of the Plan.

The term of the plan is ten years, commencing on
the date the plan was adopted in January 2001, and ending in
January 2011. The plan may be amended or terminated without
stockholder approval.

Options assumed in connection with our
    acquisition of AXENT

In December 2000, as a result of our acquisition
of AXENT, we assumed all outstanding AXENT stock options. Each
AXENT stock option assumed by us is exercisable for one share of
Symantec common stock for each one share of AXENT common stock
that was previously subject to the option, at the same exercise
price. Each option is otherwise subject to the same terms and
conditions as the original grant and generally vests over four
years and expires ten years from the date of grant. No further
options may be granted under the AXENT plans. As of
March 31, 2002, approximately 741,000 options were
outstanding.

1999 Acquisition Plan

The purpose of this plan was to issue stock
options in connection with our acquisition of URLabs in
September 1999.

Number of Shares Subject to the
    Plan.

A total of 1.0 million shares of common
stock are authorized and reserved for issuance under the plan.
As of March 31, 2002, approximately 417,000 options were
outstanding under this plan.

Eligibility for Participation.

Employees, officers, consultants, independent
contractors and advisors to us, or of any subsidiary or
affiliate of Symantec, are eligible to receive stock options
under this plan. Options awarded to officers may not exceed in
the aggregate 30% percent of all shares that are available for
grant under the plan.

Terms of Options.

Many of the terms of the options are determined
by the compensation committee, and are otherwise generally the
same in all material respects as the terms described above with
respect to our 2001 Non-Qualified Equity Incentive Plan, except
that the 1999 Acquisition Plan does not contain a provision that
provides for the expiration of employees’ options upon a
termination for cause.

Term and Amendment of the Plan.

The term of the plan is ten years, commencing on
the date the plan was adopted in July 1999, and ending in July
2009. The plan may be amended or terminated without stockholder
approval.

Non-Qualified Stock Option and Restricted
    Shares Granted to John Thompson, CEO of Symantec

In accordance with the employment agreement dated
April 11, 1999 between Mr. Thompson and us, the board of
directors approved the issuance of a non-qualified stock option
to acquire 400,000 shares of common stock to Mr. Thompson. The
option exercise price is 100% of the fair market value on the
date of grant. The



shares subject to the option vest monthly as to
1/12 of the shares beginning in April 2003 and the option has a
term life of ten years. In addition, in April 1999, we entered
into a restricted stock purchase agreement with
Mr. Thompson pursuant to which he purchased 200,000 shares
of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,000. These
shares were granted subject to a company right of repurchase
which lapsed as to 50% of the shares in April 2000 and as to the
remaining shares in April 2001.

1994 Patent Incentive Plan

The purpose of this plan is to increase awareness
of the importance of patents to our business and to provide
employees with incentives to pursue patent protection for new
technologies that may be valuable to us.

Number of Shares Subject to the
    Plan.

A total of 800,000 shares of common stock are
authorized and reserved for issuance under this plan. As of
March 31, 2002, a total of approximately 58,000 shares had
been issued under this plan. The plan only provides for the
issuance of shares of common stock, not stock options.

Eligibility for
Participation.

All employees other than executive officers and
directors are eligible to receive awards under the plan. No
employee is eligible to receive more than 100,000 shares of
common stock at any time during the term of the plan.

Terms
of Stock Awards.

Stock awards may be paid in the form of cash,
shares or a combination of the two, based on the fair market
value of the shares on the date of payment. The 1994 plan does
not provide for the issuance of awards in connection with
acquisitions of other companies by us.

Term
and Amendment of the Plan.

The term of the plan is ten years, commencing on
the date the plan was adopted in January 1995, and ending in
January 2005. The plan may be amended or terminated without
stockholder approval.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS



REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT
AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Symantec Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Symantec Corporation as of March 31, 2002
and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended March 31, 2002. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 14(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Symantec Corporation at
March 31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended March 31, 2002, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

network security software and appliance solutions to
enterprises, individuals and service providers. We are a leading
provider of client, gateway and server security solutions for
virus protection, firewall and virtual private network,
vulnerability management, intrusion detection, Internet content

security services to enterprises and service providers around
the world. Founded in 1982, we have offices in 38 countries
worldwide.

All Symantec share and per share amounts have
been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split effected as
a stock dividend, which became effective January 31, 2002.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Symantec Corporation and its
wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

During the three years ended March 31, 2002,
we acquired:

Each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a
purchase and, accordingly, their operating results have been
included in our consolidated financial statements since their
respective dates of acquisition.

We divested our web access management product
line on August 24, 2001 and the Visual Café and
substantially all of the ACT! product lines on December 31,
1999. These product lines are included in the results of
operations prior to disposition and are included in our Other
segment.

See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Fiscal Years

We have a 52/53-week fiscal accounting year.
Accordingly, all references as of and for the periods ended
March 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 reflect amounts as of and for
the periods ended March 29, 2002, March 30, 2001 and
March 31, 2000, respectively. The fiscal accounting years
ended March 29, 2002, March 30, 2001 and
March 31, 2000 each comprised 52 weeks of operations.
The fiscal accounting year ending April 2, 2003 will
comprise of 53 weeks of operations.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES — (Continued)

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of our foreign
subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the
exchange rate on the balance sheet dates. The translation
adjustments resulting from this process are shown separately as
a component of stockholders’ equity. Revenues and expenses
are translated using average exchange rates prevailing during
the year. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
included in the determination of net income (loss).

Revenue Recognition

We derive revenue primarily from sales of
packaged products, perpetual license agreements, product
maintenance and professional services, and recognize this
revenue in accordance with Statement of Position, or SOP, 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition,

as modified by
SOP 98-9, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,

Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,

when the
following conditions have been met:

We sell packaged products through a multi-tiered
distribution channel. We defer revenue on all distribution and
reseller channel inventory in excess of specified inventory
levels in these channels. We offer the right of return of our
products under various policies and programs with our
distributors, resellers and end-user customers. We estimate and
record reserves for end-user product returns and channel and
end-user rebates, and we account for these reserves as an offset
to revenue.

We enter into perpetual software license
agreements through direct sales to customers and indirect sales
with distributors and resellers. The license agreements
generally include product maintenance agreements, for which the
related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the
period of the agreements.

Our professional services include consulting,
education, and managed security services. We recognize
consulting services revenue as services are performed or upon
written acceptance from customers, if applicable. We recognize
education services revenue as services are performed. We
recognize managed security services revenue ratably over the
period that such contracted services are provided.

In arrangements that include software licenses
and maintenance and/or professional services and packaged
products with content updates (“multiple elements”),
we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on
vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of
the undelivered elements, and recognize the difference between
the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the
undelivered items as revenue. VSOE of each element is based on
the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately.
If VSOE does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance
or professional services, then the entire arrangement fee is
recognized over the performance period.

Cash Equivalents, Short-term Investments and
Restricted Investments

We consider investments in highly liquid
instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days
or less to be cash equivalents. All of our cash equivalents,
short-term investments and restricted investments are classified
as available-for-sale as of the balance sheet dates. These
securities are reported at fair market value and any unrealized
gains and losses are included as a component in
stockholders’ equity in accumulated other



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES — (Continued)

comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and
losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary
on available-for-sale securities are included in other income
(expense). The cost of securities sold is based upon the
specific identification method.

Equity Investments

We have equity investments in privately held
companies for business and strategic purposes. These investments
are included in other long-term assets and are accounted for
under the cost method. Under the cost method, the investment is
recorded at its initial cost and is periodically reviewed for
impairment. We regularly review our investment’s actual and
forecasted operating results, financial position and liquidity,
and business and industry factors in assessing whether a decline
in value of an equity investment has occurred that is other than
temporary. When such a decline in value is identified, the fair
value of the equity investment is estimated based on the
preceding factors and an impairment loss is recognized in other
income (expense).

Derivative Financial Instruments

We utilize some natural hedging to mitigate our
foreign currency exposures and we manage certain residual
exposures through the use of one-month forward exchange
contracts. We enter into forward exchange contracts with
financial institutions primarily to minimize currency exchange
risks associated with certain balance sheet positions.

Gains and losses on the contracts are included in
other income (expense) in the period that gains and losses on
the underlying transactions are recognized, and generally
offset. The fair value of forward exchange contracts
approximates cost due to the short maturity periods.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or
market. Cost is principally determined using currently adjusted
standards, which approximate actual cost on a first-in,
first-out basis. Inventory consists of raw materials and
finished goods.

Property, Equipment and Leasehold
Improvements

Property, equipment and leasehold improvements
are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation and amortization is provided on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
respective assets as follows:

Acquired Product Rights

Acquired product rights are comprised of
purchased product rights, technologies and workforce-in-place
and are stated at cost less accumulated amortization.
Amortization of purchased product rights and technologies is
provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the respective assets, generally three to five years,
and is included in cost of revenues or income (net of expense)
from sale of technologies and product lines. Effective April 1,
2002, the net balance of workforce-in-place will be reclassified
to goodwill and will no longer be amortized but will be subject
to an annual impairment test (see

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

).



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES — (Continued)

Goodwill

Goodwill is recorded through acquisitions and is
stated at cost less accumulated amortization. For acquisitions
completed prior to July 1, 2001, amortization in each case
was provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
life of the respective goodwill, generally four to five years,
and was included in operating expenses. Effective April 1,
2002, the net balance of goodwill related to acquisitions
completed prior to July 1, 2001 will no longer be amortized
but will be subject to an annual impairment test (see

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

). For acquisitions completed
subsequent to June 30, 2001, goodwill was not amortized and
will be subject to an annual impairment test.

Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, including property, equipment,
leasehold improvements, acquired product rights and goodwill,
are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when
the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to
result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is
less than its carrying amount. Such impairment loss would be
measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the
asset and its fair value based on the present value of estimated
future cash flows. No impairments have been indicated to date.
Effective April 1, 2002, impairment of goodwill and other
long-lived assets will be assessed according to new accounting
guidelines (see

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

).

Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS,
No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for stock-based awards to employees
using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion, or APB, No. 25,

Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees,

and to nonemployees using the
fair value method in accordance with SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

. In addition, we
apply applicable provisions of Financial Accounting Standards
Board, or FASB, Interpretation, or FIN, No. 44,

Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation,

an interpretation of APB No. 25.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic net income (loss) per share is
computed using the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the periods. Diluted net income
(loss) per share is computed using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive
common shares during the periods. Diluted net income
(loss) per share also includes the assumed conversion of
all of the outstanding convertible subordinated debentures and
assumed exercising of options, if dilutive in the period.
Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded in net loss
periods, as their effect would be antidilutive.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Our product revenues are concentrated in the
software industry, which is highly competitive and rapidly
changing. Significant technological changes in the industry or
customer requirements, or the emergence of competitive products
with new capabilities or technologies, could adversely affect
operating results. In addition, a significant portion of our
revenues and net income (loss) is derived from
international sales and independent agents and distributors.
Distributors that accounted for more than 10% of net revenues
included: Ingram Micro Inc. of 23%, 26% and 39% during fiscal
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively; Tech Data Group of



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES — (Continued)

11% and 12% during fiscal 2002 and 2000,
respectively; and Merisel of 11% during fiscal 2000.
Fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies,
changes in local regulatory or economic conditions, piracy or
nonperformance by independent agents or distributors could
adversely affect operating results.

Financial instruments that potentially subject us
to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash
equivalents, short-term investments, restricted investments and
trade accounts receivable. Our investment portfolio is
diversified and consists of investment grade securities. We are
exposed to credit risks in the event of default by these
institutions to the extent of the amount recorded on the balance
sheet. The credit risk in our trade accounts receivable is
substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process,
reasonably short collection terms and the geographical
dispersion of sales transactions. We maintain reserves for
potential credit losses and such losses have been within
management’s expectations.

Legal Expenses

We accrue estimated legal expenses for lawsuits
only when both of the conditions of SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies,

are met. Costs for external
attorney fees are accrued when the likelihood of the incurrence
of the related costs is probable and management has the ability
to estimate such costs. If both of these conditions are not met,
management records the related legal expenses when incurred.
Amounts accrued by us are not discounted. The material
assumptions used to estimate the amount of legal expenses
include:

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations,

and No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,

effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2001. SFAS No. 141 requires that
all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Under
SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have
indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject
to an annual impairment test. Other intangibles will continue to
be amortized over their useful lives. We will adopt SFAS
No. 142 in our first quarter of fiscal 2003. Upon adoption
of SFAS No. 142, we will stop the amortization of goodwill
and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives with a net
carrying value of approximately $525.9 million, net of a
deferred tax liability, as of March 31, 2002. As a result
of the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill existing
as of March 31, 2002 and excluding the impact of potential
impairment charges, the application of SFAS No. 142 is
expected to result in an increase in our results of operations
of approximately $198.4 million during fiscal 2003. During
the first six months of fiscal 2003, we will perform the first
of the required impairment tests of goodwill and intangible
assets deemed to have indefinite lives as of April 1, 2002,
using the two-step process required under SFAS 142. We have not
yet determined what effect these tests will have on our earnings
and financial position.

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 144,

Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets.

SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS
No. 121,

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of,

and
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment
and disposal of long-lived assets. We will adopt this statement
on April 1, 2002. Adoption of this statement is not
expected to have a material impact on our financial position or
results of operations.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES — (Continued)

The lessors associated with lease agreements
relating to certain of our facilities, described under

Synthetic Leases

in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, are special purpose entities or equivalent
structures. Presently, we account for these leases as operating
leases, while the special purpose entities or equivalent
structures own and account for the leased assets and related
liabilities in their records. The FASB has indicated that it
will, prior to June 30, 2002, issue proposed new rules on
accounting for “Entities That Lack Sufficient Independent
Economic Substance”, including special purpose entities, in
the form of an Interpretation to SFAS No. 94,

Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries,

and
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,

Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Based on public comments from the FASB
to date, the proposed interpretation will provide guidance for
determining when an entity (such as us), the Primary
Beneficiary, should consolidate another entity, a special
purpose entity or equivalent structure (such as the lessor),
that functions to support the activities of the Primary
Beneficiary. The expected proposed Interpretation may result in
us having to consolidate the operating results of the special
purpose entities and equivalent structures, which are the
lessors under the aforementioned operating lease agreements. The
effective date of these proposed new rules on our current
operating leases could be as early as the beginning of our
fiscal year 2004, and sooner on any new leases entered into
after the new rules’ effective date which utilize special
purpose entities or equivalent structures.

Reclassifications

Certain previously reported amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current presentation format with
no impact on net income (loss). All related financial
information has been restated to conform to this presentation.

Note
3.     Acquisitions and
Divestitures

Acquisition of Lindner &
    Pelc

On August 30, 2001, we purchased 100% of the
outstanding shares of Lindner & Pelc Consult GmbH, a
security services and implementation company in Berlin, Germany,
for approximately $2.2 million. The transaction was
accounted for as a purchase and we recorded approximately
$2.1 million in goodwill. As we acquired Lindner & Pelc
subsequent to June 30, 2001, the related goodwill will not
be amortized, but will be subject to an annual impairment test
in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Under the terms of the
agreement, we may also be liable for contingency payments based
on targeted future sales through September 2004. The maximum
aggregate amount of such contingency payments is approximately
$2.0 million.

Acquisition of Foster-Melliar’s
    Enterprise Security Management Division

On July 11, 2001, we acquired the enterprise
security management division of Foster-Melliar Limited, an IT
services company located in Johannesburg, South Africa. We paid
approximately $1.5 million for these assets and the IT
services business. The transaction was accounted for as a
purchase and we recorded approximately $1.5 million of
goodwill. As we acquired Foster-Melliar’s enterprise
security management division subsequent to June 30, 2001,
the related goodwill will not be amortized, but will be subject
to an annual impairment test in accordance with SFAS
No. 142. Under the terms of the agreement, we may also be
liable for contingency payments based on targeted future sales
through fiscal year 2004. The maximum aggregate amount of such
contingency payments is $1.5 million. During the March 2002
quarter, an amount of $500,000 was recorded as goodwill, as it
was determined that such amounts will be paid. The amount of
$500,000 represents contingency payments, of which the entire
amount remains as an accrual as of March 31, 2002.

Acquisition of AXENT

On December 18, 2000, we acquired 100% of
the outstanding common stock of AXENT Technologies, Inc. by
issuing approximately 29,056,000 shares of our common stock to
AXENT shareholders. We also assumed all of the outstanding AXENT
employee stock options valued at approximately
$87.0 million. A valuation specialist used our estimates to
establish the amount of acquired in-process research and

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

development. The transaction was accounted for as
a purchase. The acquisition was initially recorded during fiscal
2001 for approximately $924.7 million and allocated as follows
(in thousands):

During fiscal 2001, we also accrued approximately
$18.3 million in acquisition related expenses, which
included financial advisory, legal and accounting, duplicative
site and fixed assets, and severance costs. These acquisition
related expenses were paid by the end of the December 2001
quarter.

After filing the pre-acquisition tax returns of
AXENT during the December 2001 quarter, we identified additional
tax losses and other beneficial tax attributes available from
the pre-acquisition periods of AXENT. As a result, we recorded
additional deferred tax assets of $5 million attributable
to these carryforward tax benefits, with a corresponding offset
to goodwill.

During the September 2001 quarter, we divested
the web access management product line that we acquired with our
acquisition of AXENT. As a result, we wrote off approximately
$804,000 of net workforce-in-place related to this product line
(see

Divestiture of Web Access Management Product Line)

.

During the June 2001 quarter, we resolved certain
pre-acquisition contingencies, and as a result, we increased the
purchase price and goodwill by $4.5 million, of which
$1.2 million remains as an accrual as of March 31,
2002.

The amount allocated to tradename,
workforce-in-place, developed technology and goodwill is being
amortized over their useful lives of four years. Commencing in
fiscal 2003, however, the remaining balance of
workforce-in-place and goodwill will no longer be amortized.
Instead they will be subject to an annual impairment test in
accordance with SFAS No. 142. The unearned compensation
related to the options assumed as part of the acquisition is
being amortized over the remaining vesting period.

Acquisition of 20/20 Software

On March 31, 2000, we purchased 100% of the
outstanding common stock of 20/20 Software for up to
$16.5 million. The terms of the agreement required two
guaranteed payments totaling approximately $7.5 million. We
originally recorded approximately $6.1 million for goodwill
and $2.3 million for acquired product rights, offset by
$900,000 in related income tax liabilities, which accounted for
the $7.5 million guaranteed purchase price. In addition,
the agreement required contingent payments that were based on
targeted future sales of certain of our products from
July 1, 2000 to June 30, 2001, with a cumulative
maximum contingency amount of $9.0 million. We recorded
contingent amounts of approximately $523,000, $4.2 million
and $1.6 million during the September 2000, March 2001 and
June 2001 quarters, respectively, resulting in a cumulative
increase in the purchase price of $6.3 million, which was
allocated to goodwill. The goodwill and acquired product rights
are being amortized over a five-year period. Commencing in
fiscal 2003, however, the remaining balance of goodwill will no
longer be amortized. Instead it will be subject to an annual
impairment test in accordance with SFAS No. 142.

Acquisition of L-3 Network
    Security

On March 9, 2000, we acquired the operations
of L-3 Network Security for a one-time cash payment of
approximately $20.1 million. The transaction was accounted
for as a purchase. In connection with the transaction, we
recorded approximately $3.1 million for acquired in-process
research and development, $12.4 million for goodwill,
$3.9 million for acquired product rights and $900,000 for
other tangible and intangible assets. A valuation specialist
used our estimates to establish the amount of acquired
in-process research and development. The goodwill, acquired
product rights and other intangibles are being amortized over a
five-year period. Commencing in fiscal 2003, however, the
remaining balance of workforce-in-place and goodwill will no
longer be amortized. Instead they will be subject to an annual
impairment test in accordance with SFAS No. 142.

Acquisition of URLabs

On July 21, 1999, we purchased 100% of the
outstanding common stock of URLabs for a one-time cash payment
of approximately $42.1 million. The transaction was
accounted for as a purchase. In connection with the transaction,
we recorded approximately $1.2 million for acquired
in-process research and development, $37.0 million for
goodwill, $5.2 million for acquired product rights, $1.4
million for other intangible assets and $600,000 for other
acquired assets, offset by approximately $2.7 million in
related income tax liabilities. A valuation specialist used our
estimates to establish the amount of acquired in-process
research and development. The goodwill, acquired product rights
and other intangibles are being amortized over a five-year
period. Commencing in fiscal 2003, however, the remaining
balance of workforce-in-place and goodwill will no longer be
amortized. Instead they will be subject to an annual impairment
test in accordance with SFAS No. 142.

The following table outlines the values of the
above referenced fiscal 2000 acquisitions’ net tangible and
intangible assets, adjusted for final purchase price
allocations, as certain pre-acquisition contingencies that
existed upon acquisition have been resolved:

for comparative purposes only and is not
indicative of what operating results would have been if the
acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2000 or
of future operating results.

Divestiture of the Web Access Management
    Product Line

On August 24, 2001, we sold assets and
transferred liabilities and employees related to our web access
management product line to PassGo Technologies Ltd. for
approximately $1.1 million in cash. The assets primarily
consisted of fixed assets. The liabilities related to certain
revenue deferrals related to the web access management products.
We wrote off and transferred approximately $2.3 million of net
fixed assets and $804,000 of net workforce-in place. In
addition, we accrued approximately $311,000 in transaction
costs. These expenses were offset by approximately
$2.9 million in revenue deferrals due to the fact that no
future obligations existed for us. We recorded a pre-tax gain of
approximately $392,000 on the divestiture, which was recorded in
income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product
lines on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We also entered into an exclusive license and
option agreement with PassGo whereby they will license our web
access management technology products. In consideration for the
license, PassGo is required to pay us quarterly royalties based
on their net revenue starting at 30% and declining to 10% over a
four-year period. Because the royalties are not guaranteed and
the quarterly amounts to be received are not determinable until
earned, we are recognizing these royalties as payments are due.
We believe that we will ultimately realize the remaining value
attributable to the developed technology related to the web
access management products, and, therefore, we will continue to
amortize this remaining value, which was initially determined in
connection with the purchase price of AXENT, as referred to
above. During fiscal 2002, we recorded approximately
$1.1 million for the amortization of developed technology
in income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product
lines on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. PassGo also
has an option to purchase the technology at a price starting at
$18.8 million and declining to $3.3 million over a
four-year period.

Divestiture of the Visual Café Product
    Line

On December 31, 1999, we sold the principal
assets and liabilities of the Visual Café product line to
WebGain, Inc. The assets primarily consisted of fixed assets and
intangible assets. The liabilities related to certain revenue
deferrals recorded on our balance sheet as of December 31,
1999. In exchange for the assets and liabilities sold to
WebGain, we received $75.0 million in a lump-sum cash
payment on December 31, 1999. We wrote off or transferred
approximately $4.7 million of capitalized software, fixed
assets and inventory related to the Visual Café product
line. In addition, we accrued approximately $1.4 million in
transaction costs and $400,000 in severance packages for the
affected employees. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax gain of
approximately $68.5 million on the divestiture during
fiscal 2000, which was recorded in income, net of expense, from
sale of technologies and product lines on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

Divestiture of ACT! Product
    Line

On December 31, 1999, we licensed
substantially all of the ACT! product line technology, on an
exclusive basis, to Interact Commerce Corporation, previously
SalesLogix, for a period of four years. In addition, we sold the
inventory and fixed assets related to the ACT! product line to
Interact. In consideration for the license and assets, Interact
transferred to us 623,247 shares of its unregistered common
stock. These shares were valued at approximately
$20.0 million as of December 6, 1999, the date the
license was signed and the date the number of shares was
determined. As a result of the license, we recognized
approximately $20.0 million from the shares received and
wrote off or transferred to Interact $400,000 of inventory and
fixed assets attributed to the ACT! product line. In addition,
we accrued approximately $1.3 million for transaction
related costs. After recognizing these above amounts, we
recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $18.3 million
during fiscal 2000, which was recorded in income, net of
expense, from sale of technologies and product lines on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

During the March 2001 quarter, Interact entered
into a plan to merge with The Sage Group plc and we recorded a
loss of approximately $12.5 million as other expense
related to the other than temporary decline in value of our
investment in Interact. As a result of the merger, we received
approximately $7.5 million upon the surrender of the
Interact shares in July 2001.

In addition to the shares received from Interact,
Interact is required to pay us quarterly royalty payments for
four years. Interact will pay these royalties based on future
revenues set forth in the License, up to an aggregate maximum of
$57.0 million. Because the royalties are not guaranteed and
the quarterly amounts to be received are not determinable until
earned, we are recognizing these royalties as payments are due.
We recorded approximately $15.5 million, $19.3 million
and $5.0 million of royalty payments during fiscal 2002,
2001 and 2000 in income, net of expense, from sale of
technologies and product lines on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. At the end of the four-year period, Interact has the
exclusive option, for a period of 30 days, to purchase the
licensed technology from us for $60 million less all
royalties paid to us to date.

Other Royalties and Transition
    Fees

In accordance with individual transition
agreements, PassGo, WebGain and Interact paid us royalties
and/or fees for invoicing, collecting receivables, shipping and
other operational and support activities. We recorded
approximately $694,000, $801,000 and $894,000 for these
royalties and/or fees during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, in income, net of expense, from sale of
technologies and product lines on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

Divestiture of Electronic
    Forms

During September 1996, we sold our electronic
forms software product line and related tangible assets to
JetForm Corporation, payable in installments through the
June 2000 quarter. We received installment payments from JetForm
of approximately $397,000 and $14.7 million during fiscal
2001 and 2000, respectively. Due to the uncertainty regarding
the ultimate collectibility of these installments, we recognized
the related amounts as payments were due and collectibility was
assured from JetForm. Installment payments from JetForm were
recorded in income, net of expense, from sale of technologies
and product lines on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The components of income, net of expense, from
sale of technologies and product lines were as follows:

Note 4.     Acquired
product rights

During fiscal 2002, we recorded approximately
$1.1 million of non-acquisition product rights. This
increase was offset by a write off of $804,000 for net
workforce-in-place related to our divestiture of our web access
management product line. During fiscal 2001, we recorded
approximately $86.2 million of acquired product rights,
related to our acquisition of AXENT. During fiscal 2000, we
recorded approximately $11.3 million of acquired product
rights, primarily related to our acquisitions of 20/20, L-3 and
URLabs.

During fiscal 2002, amortization of acquired
product rights totaled approximately $32.2 million, of
which $31.1 million and $1.1 million was recorded in cost
of revenues and income (net of expense) from sale of
technologies and product lines, respectively. During fiscal 2001
and 2000, amortization of acquired product rights totaled
approximately $17.3 million and $9.7 million during
fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively, and was recorded in cost of
revenues. Acquired product rights, with the exception of
workforce-in-place, will be amortized over the next four years.
Effective April 1, 2002, the remaining balance of
workforce-in-place of approximately $3.9 million, net of a
deferred tax liability, will no longer be amortized but will be
subject to an annual impairment test in accordance with SFAS
No. 142. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Note
5.     Investments

Cash Equivalents, Short-term Investments
    and Trading Investments

All cash equivalents and short-term investments
were classified as available-for-sale securities, except for our
trading securities. We maintain a trading asset portfolio in
connection with our executive deferred compensation arrangements
that consists of marketable equity securities, which had a fair
value of approximately $1.1 million and $1.2 million
as of March 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Any activity
related to these trading assets has a corresponding effect on
the carrying value of the related deferred compensation
liability. These trading assets have not been separately
disclosed on the balance sheet due to their immaterial amounts
and were instead included in the following tabular disclosures.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The estimated fair value of the cash equivalents
and short-term investments consisted of the following:

The estimated fair value of cash equivalents and
short-term investments by contractual maturity as of
March 31, 2002 was as follows:

Except for equity securities, fair values of cash
equivalents, short-term investments and trading assets
approximate cost primarily due to the short-term maturities of
the investments and the absence of changes in security credit
ratings.

As of March 31, 2002, we held no publicly
traded equity securities. As of March 31, 2001, equity
securities of approximately $7.5 million consisted of
623,247 shares of Interact. During the March 2001 quarter,
Interact entered into a plan to merge with The Sage Group plc
and we recorded a loss of approximately $12.5 million as other
expense related to the other than temporary decline in value of
our investment in Interact. As a result of the merger, we
received approximately $7.5 million upon the surrender of
the Interact shares in July 2001.

Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities are reported as a component of stockholders’
equity and were approximately $718,000 and $614,000 as of
March 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Unregistered Equity
    Investments

As of March 31, 2002 and 2001, we held
unregistered equity investments of approximately
$8.4 million in three privately held companies and
$5.4 million in one privately held company, respectively.
These investments were recorded at cost. These investments were
classified as other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

During the March 2001 quarter, we recognized a
decline in value of approximately $12.6 million determined
to be other than temporary on our privately held investment.
Also during the March 2001 quarter, we recorded a gain of
approximately $900,000 on another investment, as a result of
this privately held company being acquired by another entity.
This investment was acquired as a result of our acquisition of



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

AXENT. The other than temporary decline in value
and gain on investment were recorded as other income (expense)
on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Restricted Investments

As of March 31, 2002 and 2001, the estimated
fair value of our restricted investments was approximately
$124.3 million and $74.5 million, respectively, and
consisted of U.S. Treasury securities or certificates of
deposits. Our available-for-sale restricted investments relate
to certain collateral requirements for lease agreements
associated with our corporate facilities in Cupertino,
California and facilities in Newport News, Virginia and
Springfield, Oregon. These amounts were classified as
non-current restricted investments on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

Derivative Financial
    Instruments

During the periods covered by the consolidated
financial statements, we did not use any derivative instrument
for trading purposes. We utilize some natural hedging to
mitigate our exposures and we manage certain residual balance
sheet exposures through the use of one-month forward exchange
contracts. We enter into forward exchange contracts with
financial institutions primarily to minimize currency exchange
risks associated with certain balance sheet positions. The fair
value of forward exchange contracts approximates cost due to the
short maturity periods. As of March 31, 2002, the notional
amount of our forward exchange contracts was approximately
$239.6 million, all of which mature in 35 days or
less. We do not hedge our foreign currency translation risk.

Note
6.     Convertible Subordinated
Debentures

On October 24, 2001, we completed a private
offering of $600.0 million of 3% convertible subordinated
debentures due November 1, 2006, the net proceeds of which
were approximately $584.6 million. The debentures are
convertible into shares of Symantec’s common stock by the
holders at any time before maturity at a conversion price of
$34.14 per share, subject to certain adjustments. We may redeem
the debentures on or after November 5, 2004, at a
redemption price of 100.75% of stated principal during the
period November 5, 2004 through October 31, 2005 and
100% thereafter. Interest will be paid semi-annually, commencing
May 1, 2002. Debt issuance costs related to the 3%
convertible subordinated debentures will be amortized on a
straight-line basis through November 1, 2006. We have
reserved approximately 17.6 million shares of common stock
for issuance upon conversion of the 3% convertible subordinated
debentures.

Note
7.     Commitments

We lease certain of our facilities and equipment
under operating leases that expire at various dates through
2018. We currently sublease some space under various operating
leases that will expire at various dates through 2012.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The future fiscal year minimum operating lease
commitments were as follows as of March 31, 2002:

Synthetic Leases

In addition, we have two real estate leasing
arrangements that we have classified as operating leases. The
related future minimum commitments for these leases were
included in the above table.

One of the lease arrangements is for two existing
office buildings in Cupertino, California. Lease payments for
these facilities are based on the three-month LIBOR in effect at
the beginning of each fiscal quarter plus a specified margin. We
have the right to acquire the related properties at any time
during the seven-year lease period ending February 1, 2006.
If, at the end of the lease term we do not renew the lease,
purchase the properties or arrange for a third party to purchase
the properties, we may be obligated to the lessor for all or
some portion of an amount up to the guaranteed residual amount
of approximately $66.0 million, representing approximately
84% of the lessor’s purchase price of the property.

On March 30, 2001, we entered into a master
lease agreement for land and the construction of two office
buildings, one in Newport News, Virginia, effective June 6,
2001, and another in Springfield, Oregon, effective
April 6, 2001. Our lease payments will vary based on one-,
three- or six-month LIBOR plus a specified margin. We have the
right to acquire the related properties at any time during the
six and one-half year lease period ending September 28,
2007. We moved into the Oregon facility immediately after the
end of the December 2001 quarter and into the Virginia facility
in April 2002. If, at the end of the lease term we do not renew
the lease, purchase the properties or arrange for a third party
to purchase the properties, we may be obligated to the lessor
for all or some portion of an amount up to the guaranteed
residual amount representing approximately 85% of the
lessor’s ultimate purchase price of the properties, up to a
maximum amount of approximately $55.1 million as of
March 31, 2002.

As security for each of these arrangements, we
are required to maintain a cash collateral balance, which was
approximately $124.3 million as of March 31, 2002. We
are required to invest the cash collateral in U.S. Treasury
securities or certificates of deposit with specified lenders and
maturities not to exceed two to three years. In accordance with
the lease terms, these funds are not available to meet operating
cash requirements. As of March 31, 2002, the investments
related to the California lease totaled approximately
$77.4 million and the investments related to the Oregon and
Virginia leases totaled $46.9 million. These amounts were
classified as non-current restricted investments within the
consolidated financial statements.

In addition, we are obligated to maintain certain
financial covenants including a minimum cash balance, tangible
net worth and quarterly earnings before income tax, depreciation
and amortization, or EBITDA, and maximum debt and senior debt to
EBITDA ratios. Future acquisitions, financing activities or
operating losses may cause us to be in violation of these
financial covenants. In the event of default, we may be required
to



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

release the cash collateral and take possession
of the buildings. As of March 31, 2002, we were in
compliance with all financial covenants.

Rent expense charged to operations totaled
approximately $25.2 million, $22.9 million and
$15.5 million during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

Note 8.     Stock
Split

On December 14, 2001, the Board of Directors
approved a two-for-one stock split of Symantec’s common
stock effected as a stock dividend, which became effective as of
January 31, 2002 to stockholders of record on
January 17, 2002. Based on the number of shares outstanding
on January 17, 2002, the stock dividend resulted in the
issuance of approximately 70.7 million additional shares of
Symantec’s common stock. All Symantec share and per share
amounts in prior periods have been adjusted to give retroactive
effect to the stock dividend.

Note 9.     Common
Stock Repurchases

On January 16, 2001, the Board of Directors
replaced the March 22, 1999 stock repurchase program with a
new authorization to repurchase up to $700.0 million, not
to exceed 30.0 million shares, of Symantec’s common
stock with no expiration date. During fiscal 2002, we
repurchased 9.6 million shares at prices ranging from
$17.78 to $24.50 per share, for an aggregate amount of
approximately $204.4 million. During fiscal 2001, we
repurchased 10.0 million shares at prices ranging from
$23.04 to $25.58 per share, for an aggregate amount of
approximately $244.4 million.

On March 22, 1999, the Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of
Symantec common stock with no expiration date. During fiscal
2000, we repurchased 2.0 million shares at prices ranging
from $8.95 to $9.94, for an aggregate amount of approximately
$18.7 million.

Note 10.     Net
Income (Loss) Per Share

The components of net income (loss) per
share were as follows:



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During fiscal 2002, approximately
7.6 million shares issuable upon conversion of the 3%
convertible subordinated debentures were excluded from the
computation of diluted net income (loss) per share, as
their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

During fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, approximately
13.8 million, 8.3 million and 928,000 shares,
respectively, issuable from assumed exercise of options were
excluded from the computation of diluted net income
(loss) per share, as their effect would have been
anti-dilutive.

Note 11.     Adoption
of Stockholder Rights Plan

On August 11, 1998, the Board of Directors
adopted a stockholder rights plan designed to ensure orderly
consideration of any future unsolicited acquisition attempt to
ensure fair value of us for our stockholders.

In connection with the plan, the Board of
Directors declared and paid a dividend of one preferred share
purchase right for each share of Symantec common stock
outstanding on the Record Date, August 21, 1998. Each right
entitles the holder, under certain circumstances, to purchase
from us one two-thousandth of a share of our Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share,
at a price of $150.00 per one one-thousandth of a share of
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, subject to
adjustment.

The rights are initially attached to Symantec
common stock and will not trade separately. If a person or a
group, an Acquiring Person, acquires 20% or more of our common
stock, or announces an intention to make a tender offer for 20%
or more of our common stock, the rights will be distributed and
will thereafter trade separately from the common stock.

If the rights become exercisable, each right
(other than the Acquiring Person) will entitle the holder to
purchase, at a price equal to the exercise price of the right, a
number of shares of our common stock having a then-current value
of twice the exercise price of the right. If, after the rights
become exercisable, we agree to merge into another entity or we
sell more than 50% of our assets, each right will entitle the
holder to purchase, at a price equal to the exercise price of
the right, a number of shares of common stock of such entity
having a then-current value of twice the exercise price.

We may exchange the rights at a ratio of one
share of common stock for each right (other than the Acquiring
Person) at any time after an Acquiring Person acquires 20% or
more of our common stock but before such person acquires 50% or
more of our common stock. We may also redeem the rights at our
option at a price of $0.001 per right at any time before an
Acquiring Person has acquired 20% or more of our common stock.
The rights will expire on August 12, 2008.

Note 12.     Employee
Benefits

401(k) Plan

We maintain a salary deferral 401(k) plan for all
of our domestic employees. This plan allows employees to
contribute up to 20% of their pretax salary up to the maximum
dollar limitation prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. We
match 100% of the first $500 of employees’ contributions
and then 50% of the employees’ contribution. The maximum
employer match in any given plan year is 3% of the
employees’ eligible compensation. Our contributions under
the plan were approximately $4.1 million, $3.0 million
and $2.4 million during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000.

Restricted Shares

During fiscal 1999, we issued 200,000 restricted
shares to our current CEO for a purchase price of $0.005 per
share, vesting 50% at each anniversary date, with the first
anniversary date being April 14, 2000. Unearned
compensation equivalent to the market value of the common stock
on the date of grant, less par, was charged



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

to stockholders’ equity and was amortized
into compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the
vesting term. As of March 31, 2002, there were 200,000
shares fully vested and outstanding.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

In September 1998, our stockholders approved the
1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and reserved a total of
1.0 million shares of common stock for issuance. The plan
was subsequently amended by our stockholders on
September 15, 1999, to increase the shares available for
issuance by approximately 1.5 million shares and to add an
“evergreen” provision whereby the number of shares
available for issuance increases automatically on January 1 of
each year (beginning in 2000) by 1% of our outstanding shares of
common stock on each immediately preceding December 31
during the term of the plan, provided that the aggregate number
of shares issued over the term of the plan does not exceed
16.0 million shares. On January 1, 2002, 2001 and
2000, the number of shares available for issuance automatically
increased by approximately 1.4 million, 1.5 million
and 1.2 million shares, respectively, for a total of
approximately 6.6 million shares of common stock reserved
under the plan. Subject to certain limitations, our employees
may purchase, through payroll deductions of 2% to 10% of their
compensation, shares of common stock at a price per share that
is the lesser of 85% of the fair market value as of the
beginning of the offering period or the end of the purchase
period. As of March 31, 2002, approximately
1.5 million shares had been issued and 5.1 million
shares remain available under the plan.

Stock Award Plans

In September 2000, our stockholders approved the
2000 Directors Equity Incentive Plan and reserved 50,000 shares
of common stock for issuance under this plan. The purpose of
this plan is to provide the members of the Board of Directors
with an opportunity to receive common stock for all or a portion
of the retainer payable to each director for serving as a
member. Each director may elect to receive 50% to 100% of the
retainer to be paid in the form of stock. As of March 31,
2002, a total of approximately 14,000 shares had been issued
under this plan.

In January 1995, the Board of Directors approved
the terms of the 1994 Patent Incentive Plan. The purpose of this
plan is to increase awareness of the importance of patents to
our business and to provide employees with incentives to pursue
patent protection for new technologies that may be valuable to
us. Our executive officers are not eligible for awards under the
1994 Patent Incentive Plan, and no employee is eligible to
receive more than 100,000 shares of common stock at any time
during the term of the plan. The Board of Directors reserved
800,000 shares of common stock for issuance under this plan. As
of March 31, 2002, a total of approximately 58,000 shares
had been issued under this plan.

Stock awards issued under these stock award plans
are recorded as compensation expense.

Stock Option Plans

We maintain stock option plans pursuant to which
an aggregate total of approximately 76.6 million shares of
common stock have been reserved for issuance as incentive and
nonqualified stock options to employees, officers, directors,
consultants, independent contractors and advisors to us, or of
any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of Symantec as the Board of
Directors or committee may determine. The purpose of these plans
is to attract, retain and motivate eligible persons whose
present and potential contributions are important to our success
by offering them an opportunity to participate in our future
performance through awards of stock options and stock bonuses.
Under the terms of these plans, the option exercise price may
not be less than 100% of the fair market value on the date of
grant and the options have a maximum term of ten years and
generally vest over a four-year period.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In January 2001, the Board of Directors approved
the terms of the 2001 Non-Qualified Equity Incentive Plan, under
which we grant options to employees, officers, directors,
consultants, independent contractors and advisors to us, or of
any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of Symantec as the Board of
Directors or committee may determine. Options awarded to
insiders may not exceed in the aggregate fifty (50%) percent of
all shares that are available for grant under the plan and
employees of the company who are not insiders must receive at
least fifty (50%) percent of all shares that are available for
grant under the plan. The terms of this plan are similar to
those of our 1996 Equity Incentive Plan, except that it was
adopted, and may be amended, without stockholder approval. The
Board of Directors reserved 6.0 million shares of common
stock for issuance under the plan. As of March 31, 2002,
approximately 2.7 million options were outstanding under
this plan.

In December 2000, as a result of our acquisition
of AXENT, we assumed all outstanding AXENT stock options. Each
AXENT stock option assumed by us is exercisable for one share of
Symantec common stock for each one share of AXENT common stock
that was previously subject to the option, at the same exercise
price. Each option is otherwise subject to the same terms and
conditions as the original grant and generally vest over four
years and expires ten years from the date of grant. No further
options may be granted under the AXENT plans. As of
March 31, 2002, approximately 741,000 options were
outstanding.

In July 1999, the Board of Directors approved the
terms of the 1999 Acquisition Plan. Options awarded to officers
may not exceed in the aggregate thirty (30%) percent of all
shares that are available for grant under the plan. The terms of
this plan are similar to those of our 1996 Equity Incentive
Plan, except that it was adopted, and may be amended, without
stockholder approval. The Board of Directors reserved
1.0 million shares of common stock for issuance under the
plan. As of March 31, 2002, approximately 417,000 options
were outstanding under this plan.

In accordance with the employment agreement dated
April 11, 1999 between our current CEO and Symantec, the
Board of Directors approved the issuance of a non-qualified
stock option to acquire 400,000 shares of common stock to the
CEO. The option was granted at 100% of the fair market value on
the date of grant, has a term life of ten years and vest over a
five-year period. As of March 31, 2002, all 400,000 options
were outstanding.

In May 1996, our stockholders approved the 1996
Equity Incentive Plan and subsequently approved amendments to
increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for
issuance under the plan to a total of approximately
42.5 million shares, including approximately
7.2 million, 4.8 million and 6.0 million shares
approved on September 12, 2001, December 15, 2000 and
September 18, 2000, respectively. As of March 31, 2002,
approximately 24.2 million options were outstanding under
this plan. The material features of this plan are described in
our proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on July 26, 2001.

As of March 31, 2002, approximately 285,000
options granted to employees and 75,000 options granted to
directors were outstanding under the 1988 Employees Stock Option
Plan, which was superseded by the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan,
and the 1993 Directors Stock Option Plan, respectively. No
further options may be granted under these plans.

We elected to follow APB No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

in accounting
for our employee stock options because, as discussed below, the
alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS
No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,

requires the use of option valuation models that were not
developed for use in valuing employee stock options. Under APB
No. 25, because the exercise price of our employee stock
options generally equals the market price of the underlying
stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is
recognized in our consolidated financial statements.

Pro forma information regarding net income
(loss) and net income (loss) per share is required by
SFAS No. 123. This information is required to be determined
as if we had accounted for our employee stock options, including
shares issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
collectively called “options”, granted subsequent to
March 31, 1995 under the fair value method of that
statement. The fair value of options granted during fiscal 2002,
2001 and 2000 reported below has been estimated at the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model assuming no
expected dividends and the following weighted average
assumptions:

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price
volatility. Because our options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options and because
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate, in our opinion, the existing
models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of
the fair value of our options.

The weighted average estimated fair values of
employee stock options granted during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000
were approximately $20.66, $12.70 and $13.62 per share,
respectively. The weighted average estimated fair value of
employee stock purchase rights granted under the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 were
approximately $14.56, $10.53 and $10.03, respectively.

For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the
estimated fair value of the options was amortized to expense
over the options’ vesting period, for employee stock
options, and the six-month purchase period, for stock purchases
under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Options assumed as the
result of our acquisition of AXENT were not included in the
estimated fair value. Shares purchased through the AXENT
Purchase Plan subsequent to the closing date of the AXENT
acquisition were included in the estimated fair value and were
included in the pro forma information as follows:

The effects on pro forma disclosures of applying
SFAS No. 123 are not likely to be representative of the
effects on pro forma disclosures of future years.

A summary of our stockholder approved and
non-approved equity compensation plans as of March 31, 2002
was as follows (in thousands, except exercise price):

*

Our 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan contains an
    “evergreen” provision whereby the number of shares
    available for issuance increases automatically on January 1 of
    each year (beginning in 2000) by 1% of our outstanding shares of
    common stock on each immediately preceding December 31
    during the term of the plan.

The total number of shares to be issued upon
exercise does not include approximately 742,000 outstanding
options as of March 31, 2002 that were assumed as part of
various acquisitions. The weighted average exercise price of
these outstanding options was $18.52 as of March 31, 2002.
In connection with these acquisitions, we have only assumed
outstanding options and rights, but not the plans themselves,
and therefore, no further options may be granted under these
acquired-company plans.

Our non-stockholder approved equity compensation
plans include the following:

abandoned fixed asset and leasehold improvement
write-offs. As of March 31, 2002, we had an accrual of
approximately $6.8 million outstanding related to rent and
related exit costs of the facilities and related abandoned fixed
asset and leasehold improvement write-offs. During the June 2002
quarter, we will record costs of severance, related benefits and
outplacement services, as a result of the relocation of our
Leiden, Netherlands operations to Dublin, Ireland.

Also during the March 2002 quarter, we recorded
approximately $950,000 for the costs of severance, related
benefits and outplacement services, as we reorganized various
operating functions. As a result, our workforce was reduced by
29 employees. As of March 31, 2002, we had an accrual of
approximately $536,000 outstanding for related severance,
benefits and outplacement services.

During the December 2001 quarter, we recorded
approximately $9.4 million for exit costs associated with
the relocation of our North American support group from Eugene,
Oregon to an expanded facility in Springfield, Oregon. These
costs included approximately $6.7 million in rent remaining
on the abandoned facilities in Eugene, Oregon and related exit
costs, and $2.7 million in related abandoned leasehold
improvement write-offs. As of March 31, 2002, we had an
accrual of approximately $6.2 million outstanding related
to rent and related exit costs of the facilities.

During the June 2001 quarter, we recorded
approximately $2.0 million for the costs of employee
severance, related benefits, outplacement services and
abandonment of certain facilities primarily related to former
AXENT operations. As a result, our workforce was reduced by 58
employees. These severance, related benefits and outplacement
costs were paid by the end of the September 2001 quarter. As of
March 31, 2002, we had approximately $233,000 accrual
remaining related to the abandoned facilities.

Details of the fiscal 2002 restructuring, site
closures and other expenses were as follows:

During the March 2001 quarter, we reorganized
various operating functions, thereby reducing our workforce by
50 employees, and recorded approximately $1.1 million for the
costs of severance, related benefits and outplacement services.
In addition, we provided approximately $1.2 million for
costs of severance and related benefits for six members of our
senior management due to a realignment of certain
responsibilities. These severance, related benefits, and
outplacement costs were paid by the end of the September 2001
quarter.

During the December 2000 quarter, we reduced a
portion of our operations in Toronto, thereby reducing our
workforce by 10 employees, and recorded approximately $400,000
for the costs of severance, related benefits and abandonment of
certain equipment. In addition, approximately $900,000 was

responsibilities. These severance and related benefits were paid
by the end of the March 2001 quarter.

Details of the fiscal 2001 restructuring, site
closures and other expenses were as follows:

During the March 2000 quarter, we reduced our
operations in our Melville and Toronto sites, thereby reducing
our workforce by 96 employees. As a result, we vacated the
facility in Melville and reduced the space occupied in Toronto.
We recorded approximately $3.4 million for employee
severance, outplacement and abandonment of certain facilities
and equipment during the March 2000 quarter. In addition, we
provided approximately $700,000 for costs of severance, related
benefits and outplacement services for two members of senior
management due to the realignment of our business units and
their resulting departures during the March 2000 quarter. These
expenses were paid by the end of the December 2001 quarter.

During the December 1999 quarter, we reduced our
Internet Tools business unit’s workforce and reduced our
sales workforce. There were 48 employees in the Internet Tools
business unit affected, resulting in a charge of approximately
$1.8 million for severance, related benefits and
outplacement services. The sales workforce reduction affected 10
employees, resulting in a charge of approximately $400,000 for
severance, related benefits and outplacement services. These
severance and related benefits were paid by the end of the
December 2001 quarter.

During the September 1999 quarter, we provided
approximately $700,000 for costs of severance, related benefits
and outplacement services for two members of senior management
due to the realignment of our business units and their resulting
departures. We also recorded approximately $2.7 million for
certain costs related to an agreement reached with our former
CEO during the June 1999 quarter. These costs were comprised of
severance and acceleration of unvested options. These severance
and related benefits were paid by the end of the December 2001
quarter.

Details of the fiscal 2000 restructuring, site
closures and other expenses were as follows:

The exit plans associated with each of the
reductions in workforce and facility closures above specifically
identified all the significant actions, including:

Employee severance and outplacement was primarily
comprised of severance packages for employees who were
terminated as a result of the restructurings. As part of each
restructuring plan, we specifically identified those individuals
who would not continue employment with us. The severance periods
ranged from one to six months. The total cost of the severance
packages was accrued and included in a restructuring charge



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

after the identified employees had their
severance packages communicated to them. Additionally, we
accrued estimated costs associated with outplacement services to
be provided to terminating employees, as these costs have no
future economic benefit to us. The remaining accrual as of
March 31, 2002 was for outstanding severance and
outplacement costs.

Excess facilities and equipment included 1)
remaining lease payments associated with building leases
subsequent to their abandonment dates, 2) net of estimated
sublease income, and/or 3) estimated least termination costs.
The cash outlays for these leases are to be made over the
remaining term of each lease, unless a lease termination payment
is required. In addition, we wrote off the carrying value of
site-specific equipment, furniture, fixtures and leasehold
improvements, which would no longer be utilized. The accrual as
of March 31, 2002 relates to the remaining lease payments,
net of estimated sublease income, which will be paid over the
remaining lease term subsequent to the abandonment of each
facility.

Note 14.     Other
Comprehensive Loss

The components of other comprehensive loss were
as follows:

Note 15.     Income
Taxes

The components of the provision for income taxes
were as follows:

The difference between our effective income tax
rate and the federal statutory income tax rate as a percentage
of income before income taxes was as follows:

The principal components of deferred tax assets
were as follows:

Realization of a significant portion of the
$71.8 million of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon
our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income and the
implementation of tax planning strategies. We



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

believe that it is more likely than not that the
net deferred tax assets will be realized based on historical
earnings, expected levels of future taxable income in the U.S.
and certain foreign jurisdictions, and the implementation of tax
planning strategies. The valuation allowance remained unchanged
during fiscal 2002 and increased by $5.1 million during
fiscal 2001 due to a write-down of an equity investment, the
loss of which may not be deductible for tax purposes.

As of March 31, 2002, we have tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $1.6 million that expire
during fiscal 2004 through 2005. In addition, we have net
operating loss carryforwards attributable to Quarterdeck of
approximately $40.8 million that expire during fiscal 2011
through 2019. We also have net operating loss carryforwards
attributable to AXENT of approximately $19.1 million that
expire during fiscal 2007 through 2018. Because of the
“change in ownership” provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, the net operating loss carryforwards of
Quarterdeck and AXENT are subject to an annual limitation of
approximately $2.4 million and $10.6 million,
respectively, regarding their utilization against taxable income
in future periods.

Pretax income from international operations was
approximately $168.4 million, $144.9 million and
$116.8 million during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

No provision has been made for federal or state
income taxes on approximately $287.2 million of cumulative
unremitted earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries as of
March 31, 2002, since we plan to indefinitely reinvest
these earnings. As of March 31, 2002, the unrecognized
deferred tax liability for these earnings was approximately
$74.7 million.

Note
16.     Litigation

On August 15, 2001, a customer filed a
lawsuit in Michigan state court, purportedly on behalf of a
class of customers who had experienced a particular error
message when using the Symantec LiveUpdate feature. The
complaint alleged violations of the Michigan Consumer Protection
Act and breach of implied warranty. The parties agreed to
dismiss the lawsuit with no payment by us, and the court ordered
the matter dismissed on January 9, 2002.

On December 23, 1999, Altiris Inc. filed a
lawsuit against us in the United States District Court, District
of Utah, alleging that unspecified Symantec products including
Norton Ghost Enterprise Edition, infringed a patent owned by
Altiris. The lawsuit requests damages, injunctive relief, costs
and attorney fees. In October 2001, a stipulated judgment of
non-infringement was entered following the court’s ruling
construing the claims of the Altiris patent, and Altiris has
appealed the ruling. We believe this claim has no merit, and we
intend to defend the action vigorously.

On May 12, 1999, a venture capital entity
and a former stockholder owning less than a majority share of
CKS Limited, which AXENT acquired in March 1999, commenced an
action in the Suffolk County Superior Court in Boston,
Massachusetts against AXENT and its directors. The action
alleged violations of the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act,
negligent misrepresentation and unfair trade practices. We
inherited this case upon our acquisition of AXENT. The case was
settled and dismissed during the September 2001 quarter on
confidential terms not material to us.

In July 1998, the Ontario Court of Justice
(General Division) ruled that we should pay a total of
approximately $4.7 million for damages, plus interest, to
Triolet Systems, Inc. and Brian Duncombe in a decade-old
copyright action, for damages arising from the grant of a
preliminary injunction against them. The damages were awarded
following the court’s ruling that evidence presented later
in the case showed the injunction was not warranted. We
inherited this case through our acquisition of Delrina
Corporation, which was the plaintiff in this lawsuit. Our appeal
of the decision was denied, and we have requested leave to seek
further review of that decision. We recorded a charge of
approximately $5.8 million during the June 1998 quarter,
representing the unaccrued portion of the judgment plus costs,
and an additional charge of



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

approximately $3.1 million for post-judgment
interest and other costs during the March 2002 quarter. As of
March 31, 2002, we believe that we have adequately accrued
for both the damages and costs.

In October 1997, a complaint was filed in the
United States District Court for the District of Utah on behalf
of PowerQuest Corporation, against Quarterdeck, which we
acquired in March 1999. The complaint alleges that
Quarterdeck’s partitioning software, included in
Partition-It and Partition-It Extra Strength, violated a patent
held by PowerQuest. In January 1998, PowerQuest obtained a
second patent relating to partitioning and has amended its
complaint to allege infringement of that patent as well. The
plaintiff has added us as a defendant and seeks an injunction
against distribution of Partition-It and Partition-It Extra
Strength and monetary damages. We believe this claim has no
merit, and we intend to defend the action vigorously.

On September 15, 1997, Hilgraeve Corporation
filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court,
Eastern District of Michigan, against us, alleging that
unspecified Symantec products infringe a patent owned by
Hilgraeve. The lawsuit requests damages, injunctive relief,
costs and attorney fees. In March 2000, the court granted our
summary judgment motions and dismissed the case. In September
2001, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the
summary judgment and ordered the case returned to the District
Court. We believe this lawsuit has no merit, and we intend to
defend the action vigorously.

Over the past few years, it has become common for
software companies, including us, to receive claims of patent
infringement. At any given time, we are evaluating claims of
patent infringement asserted by several parties, with respect to
certain of our products. The outcome of any related litigation
or negotiation could have a material adverse impact on our
future results of operations or cash flows.

We are also involved in a number of other
judicial and administrative proceedings that are incidental to
our business. We intend to defend all of the aforementioned
pending lawsuits vigorously and although adverse decisions (or
settlements) may occur in one or more of the cases, the final
resolution of these lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate,
is not expected to have a material adverse affect on our
financial condition, although it is not possible to estimate the
possible loss or losses from each of these cases. Depending,
however, on the amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution
of these lawsuits, it is possible that our future results of
operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected
in a particular period. We have accrued certain estimated legal
fees and expenses related to certain of these matters; however,
actual amounts may differ materially from those estimated
amounts.

The total amount of legal and settlement expenses
accrued as of the respective year-ends and the amounts expensed
for the years ended are reflected below:

Balance as of March 31, 2002

$

12.5 million

Amount expensed during fiscal 2002

The legal expenses accrued by us are deemed
probable because the lawsuits have been filed, management has
determined its plans of action with regards to the cases and,
accordingly, knows that it will incur legal expenses related to
the particular lawsuit. Utilizing the assumptions noted in the
accounting policy, see

Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies,

management is able to estimate a minimum amount of
legal fees to be incurred in these lawsuits.

Note 17.     Segment
Information

Our operating segments are significant strategic
business units that offer different products and services,
distinguished by customer needs. We have five operating
segments: Enterprise Security, Enterprise Administration,
Consumer Products, Services and Other.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Enterprise Security segment focuses on
providing Internet security technology, global response and
services necessary for organizations to manage their information
security needs. The Enterprise Administration segment offers
products that enable companies to be more effective and
efficient within their information technology departments. The
Consumer Products segment focuses on delivering our security and
problem-solving products to individual users, home offices and
small businesses. The Services segment is focused on providing
information security solutions that incorporate best-of-breed
technology, security expertise and global resources to help
enable e-business success. The Other segment is comprised of
sunset products and products nearing the end of their life
cycle. Also included in the Other segment are all indirect
costs, general and administrative expenses, amortization of
goodwill and charges that are one-time in nature, such as
acquired in-process research and development, legal judgments
and settlements and restructuring, site closures and other
expenses which are not charged to the other operating segments.

We shifted our focus to these operating segments
during fiscal 2000, with additional realignment in fiscal 2002
and 2001. Due to this change, we have presented the fiscal 2001
and 2000 segment information to conform to our current segments.

The accounting policies of the segments are the
same as those described in the summary of significant accounting
policies. There are no intersegment sales. Our chief operating
decision maker evaluates performance based on direct profit or
loss from operations before income taxes not including
nonrecurring gains and losses, foreign exchange gains and losses
and miscellaneous other income and expenses. Assets and
liabilities are not discretely allocated or reviewed by segment.
