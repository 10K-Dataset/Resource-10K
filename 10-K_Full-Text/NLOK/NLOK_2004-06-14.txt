Business Overview

We currently view our business in five operating segments: Consumer Products,
Enterprise Security, Enterprise Administration, Services and Other. For
financial information related to our operating segments, see Note 16 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Consumer Products

Our Consumer Products segment focuses on delivering our
Internet security and
problem-solving products to individual users, home offices and small
businesses. Symantec’s Norton brand of consumer security products is a market
leader in desktop protection, with integrated products
that work seamlessly to protect customers’ computers from virus outbreaks or
malicious hacker attacks. Most of the products that we are currently marketing
or developing feature LiveUpdate™. This feature enables users to easily download
security updates including virus definitions, firewall rules, URL databases and
uninstall scripts. Our consumer products run primarily on
Windows® and
Macintosh® operating systems. Our Consumer Products segment represented 47%,
41% and 35% of net revenues during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Product offerings in the Consumer Products segment include Norton AntiVirus™,
Norton Internet Security™ and Norton SystemWorks™.



Enterprise Security

Our Enterprise Security segment provides best-of-breed
security solutions for all tiers of a network: at the gateways between the
network and the outside world, at the servers that act as the network’s vital
organs, and at end-user devices including desktop PCs, laptops and handhelds.
Our comprehensive solutions include virus protection and content filtering,
firewall and virtual private networking, or VPN, intrusion prevention, and
security management. In addition, we have expanded our technology offerings to
include integrated solutions at the gateway and client levels, which combine
several of our individual technology solutions, and early warning solutions. At
the gateway level, our products run on Windows NT ®, Solaris®, and Linux®
platforms. Our products at the server level operate on Windows NT, UNIX, Linux
and other key server platforms. At the client level, our products run on the
Windows platform. Our Enterprise Security segment represented 39%, 42% and 42%
of net revenues during fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Antivirus

Our virus protection and content filtering technologies provide protection at
the gateway, server, and client tiers against known and unknown threats.
Users of our virus protection and filtering products are able to take action to
protect their enterprise from risks associated with using Internet resources.
This includes scanning or monitoring data that enters, leaves or travels inside
the organization, as well as detecting and eliminating malicious code that may
be introduced into a company’s network. Products and services providing
protection from virus attacks represent the most well-known and largest market
component of the enterprise security area. Product offerings include Symantec
AntiVirus™ and Symantec AntiVirus™ Scan Engine.

Integrated Solutions

An integrated solution combines multiple security technologies with management,
customer service and support, and advance research. Integrated solutions are
designed to work together as a unified system, providing better overall
protection, quicker response and more efficient management. Product offerings
include Symantec™ Gateway Security and Symantec™ Client Security.

Firewalls

Firewalls provide protection against unwanted intrusion while enabling the flow
of approved traffic. VPN solutions are designed to enable employees and
business partners to remotely access an enterprise network in a secure, cost
effective manner. We offer firewall and VPN solutions that protect throughout
the network, including at Internet gateways, gateways to sensitive internal
networks and at client devices. Product offerings include Symantec™ Enterprise
Firewall with VPN, Symantec™ Firewall/VPN Appliance, and Symantec™ Clientless VPN Appliance.

Management

At the gateway and server level, our policy compliance management solutions
help customers define, manage, and enforce policies from a central location as
well as probe for network vulnerabilities and suggest remedies to proactively
reduce business risk. The initial step to reduce corporate risk is to
effectively measure compliance to a business’ security policy and detect
vulnerabilities where critical information resides.

Symantec security management products provide a comprehensive solution allowing
for the consolidation of security events, the containment of security threats
and the centralization of security policy enforcement. These products are built
on an open, interoperable framework that enables us to work together with third
party solutions to provide secure, manageable, and scalable enterprise
security. Product offerings include Symantec Enterprise Security Manager™,
Symantec™ Event Manager and Symantec™ Incident Manager.

Early Warning Solutions

Symantec’s early warning solutions provide organizations with customized and
comprehensive notifications of cyber attacks worldwide, with countermeasures to
prevent attacks before they occur, enabling them to mitigate risk and manage
threats. These solutions are supported by Symantec™ Security Response, our
Internet security research and support organization. Product offerings include
Symantec DeepSight™ Alert Services and Symantec DeepSight™ Threat Management
System.

Intrusion Detection

Organizations must protect information from unwanted users and hackers and
control access to information to maintain business integrity. At the gateway
and server level, our intrusion detection products monitor systems for patterns
of misuse and abuse and can warn organizations before systems are misused or
information is stolen. Product offerings include Symantec ManHunt™, Symantec
Intruder Alert™ and Symantec™ Decoy Server.



Enterprise Administration

Our Enterprise Administration segment offers open and modular products and
services that enable companies to effectively and efficiently manage their IT
infrastructures. Our solutions are used to optimize the security and
availability of our customers’ information, while reducing operational costs,
increasing IT quality of service, reducing complexity, and enhancing our
customers’ ability to rapidly respond to constant business and technological
change. This is typically accomplished by transforming existing manual IT
processes into automated and unattended operations that can be performed on
multiple systems simultaneously across the enterprise, in a dynamic and
adaptive manner.

Our solutions allow customers to manage virtually any function at any point in
the lifecycle of their computing systems and devices, from network
auto-discovery and IT asset management, to operating system provisioning and
application deployment, ongoing security updates and configuration management,
rapid backup and disaster recovery, de-provisioning, and Help Desk remote
control. Our Enterprise Administration segment represented 12%, 15% and 21% of
net revenues during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Product
offerings include Symantec Ghost™ Enterprise Edition, pcAnywhere™, the
ON

i

Command™ product family, V2i Protector™, PartitionMagic™ Pro,
VolumeManager™, ServerMagic™ for NetWare® and OEM Factory Solutions.

Services

Our Services segment provides information security solutions that
incorporate advanced technology, security best practices and expertise and
global resources to help enable e-business success. Through its comprehensive
offerings, our Services segment delivers holistic security assessments,
planning and implementation, proactive solutions for security management and
response and knowledge transfer to develop internal security skills. Our
Services segment represented 2%, 2% and 1% of net revenues during
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Services offerings include Symantec™
Managed Security Services, Symantec™ Consulting Services and Symantec™
Education Services.

Other

Our Other segment is comprised of sunset products, products nearing the end of
their life cycle.

Sales, Marketing and Customers

In addition to our direct sales force, we license our enterprise and consumer
products through our distributor, corporate reseller, value-added reseller and
system integrator channels.

We sell our consumer products to individuals and small offices/home offices
around the world through a multi-tiered distribution network. Our products are
available to customers through channels that include: distributors, retailers,
direct marketers, Internet-based resellers, original equipment
manufacturers, educational institutions and Internet service providers. We also
sell some of our products and product upgrades through direct mail/e-mail and
over the Internet, in conjunction with channel partners.

We maintain distribution relationships with major independent distributors. Our
indirect sales force works closely with our major distributor and reseller
accounts to manage the flow of orders, inventory levels and sales to customers.
We also work closely with them to execute channel marketing promotions and
other cooperative marketing activities.

Our agreements with distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be
terminated by either party at any time without cause. These distributors are
not within our control and are not obligated to purchase products from us. They
also distribute other vendors’ product lines.

In fiscal 2004, three customers accounted for more than 10% of our total net
revenues. In fiscal 2003 and 2002, two customers accounted for more than 10% of our total net revenues.

Our marketing activities include:



For our consumer products, we typically offer two types of rebate programs
within most countries: volume incentive rebates to channel partners and
promotional rebates to end-users. The distributor or reseller earns a volume
incentive rebate primarily based upon their sale of products to end-users. From
time to time, we also make rebates available to individual users of various
products acquired through major retailers. We regularly offer upgrade rebates
to existing customers purchasing a new version of a product. Both volume
incentive rebates and end-user rebates are accrued as an offset to revenue when
revenue is originally recorded.

International Sales

Revenues from sales outside of the United States represented 52%, 49% and 47%
of our net revenues during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our
international revenues consisted of sales primarily in the Europe, Middle East
and Africa, or EMEA, region and sales from this region represented 33%, 30% and
27% of our net revenues during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Additional financial information regarding our international sales is provided
in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The majority of our net revenues from EMEA are derived from sales by affiliates
of our major United States distributors. Additionally, we sell our products
through authorized distributors, which may be restricted to specified
territories. For most of our consumer products, we translate the documentation,
software and packaging into the local language and prepare marketing programs
for each local market.

We have marketing offices in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada,
China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong,
Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan,
Turkey, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. These local offices
facilitate our marketing and distribution in international markets. Our
international operations are subject to various risks common to international
operations, including but not restricted to:

Symantec Security Response

Symantec Security Response is a team of dedicated intrusion experts, security
engineers, virus hunters and global technical support teams that work in tandem
to provide extensive coverage for enterprises and consumers. Symantec Security
Response provides customers with comprehensive, global, 24x7 Internet security
expertise to guard against today’s blended Internet threats, which are threats
that are multi-faceted in their operating methods and effects.

Symantec Security Response addresses blended threats by providing a thorough
analysis of Internet security threats, evaluating how threats work together,
then offering recommendations on protection. This allows us to respond to
complex security threats in a more holistic, preventive manner. A Symantec
Security Response analysis can show how multiple threats work together, how
this could impact a customer, and how to protect against these threats.

Symantec Security Response delivers knowledgeable, proactive security
protection through product security policies and best practice guidelines that
can be updated and distributed through automated processes. Additionally,
Symantec Security Response provides rapid reactive security protection through
its incident response program, including emergency security signatures and
policies, as well as outbound communications such as alerting services.

Symantec Security Response not only provides time-sensitive security advisories
using web updates, but also provides alerting services, technical support and
media alerts. Symantec Security Response is committed to educating the general
public about key security threats and trends through published white papers and
speaking engagements worldwide.

Research Centers



The research centers for Symantec Security Response are focused on collecting
and analyzing the latest malware threats, from network security threats and
vulnerabilities to viruses and worms. When a new threat or vulnerability is
discovered, Symantec Security Response experts provide rapid emergency
response, focusing on communication with customers and delivery of security
updates for our security products. Research centers are located around the
world, including the United States, Asia Pacific and Europe.

To ensure that customers are utilizing the most recent technologies available
for addressing security issues, Symantec Security Response experts leverage our
sophisticated back-end product architecture. This architecture allows users to
receive the latest security updates—including intrusion detection signatures
and virus definitions—automatically in the event of a new security threat or
outbreak. LiveUpdate technology simplifies and speeds the process of receiving
and implementing security updates for our security product offerings at the
server, gateway and desktop levels.

Technical Support

With more than 300 experts in Internet security, desktop and network
management, our global technical support team is available around the clock.
Our technical support experts provide customers with information on product
implementation and usage, as well as countermeasures and identification tools
for new threats.

We maintain centralized support facilities throughout the world to drive rapid
response to complex queries. Support is available in multiple languages,
including Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin,
Portuguese and Spanish.

Enterprise Security Support

Our enterprise security support program offers annual support contracts to
enterprise customers worldwide. Our standard annual support contracts provide
1) unlimited hot-line service delivered by telephone, fax, e-mail and over the
Internet; 2) immediate patches for severe problems; 3) periodic software
updates; 4) access to our technical knowledge base and FAQ facility; and 5) an
invitation to the annual user group meeting. Inclusive in these standard annual
support contracts are virus definitions and intrusion detection signatures
created by Symantec Security Response. Customers may augment their standard
annual support contract with services such as 24x7 telephone and web support,
advanced alerting services, additional designated callers (contacts) and
additional language support, as well as a Technical Account Manager, assigned
to work closely with an organization and act as a focal point for all issues.

Consumer Product Support

Our consumer product support program provides free self-help online services to
all consumer customers worldwide, as well as free e-mail support. A team of
product experts, editors and language translators are dedicated to maintaining
the robustness of the online knowledge base. Generally, telephone product
support is provided for a fee. For customers that subscribe to them, the latest
virus definitions and application bug fixes and/or patches for most of our
currently marketed and developed products are downloaded automatically through
LiveUpdate, created by Symantec Security Response.

We revise these fee-based support programs from time to time as customer
requirements change and as market trends dictate. These programs may vary
slightly by region.

Recent Acquisitions and Divestitures

Acquisitions

Since our initial public offering on June 23, 1989, we have completed acquisitions of 33 businesses.
Our recent acquisitions included:

We accounted for each of
these acquisitions as a business purchase and, accordingly, we
have included the operating results of these businesses in our consolidated
financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. See Note 3 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the
above acquisitions. We also have acquired several other



businesses in the past, including Peter Norton Computing, Inc. on August 31,
1990. We continue to use the Norton brand name for certain consumer products
developed and marketed by us.

In April 2003, we
purchased certain assets related to Roxio Inc.’s
GoBack

TM

computer recovery software business. In addition, in
August 2003, we purchased a
security technology patent as part of a legal settlement in

Hilgraeve, Inc. v.
Symantec Corporation.

Divestitures

In August 2001, we sold
assets and transferred liabilities and employees related to our Web
Access Management product line to PassGo Technologies, Ltd. and agreed to license them the related
technology for a period of four years through August 2005. In
December 1999, we licensed substantially all of the ACT! Product line
technology to Interact Commerce Corporation for a period of four years through December 2003.

For further discussion on our recent acquisitions and divestitures, see Note
3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Product Development,
Partnerships, Investments and Acquisitions

We use a multiple product sourcing strategy that includes:

•

internal development;

•

licensing from third parties;

•

investment in companies; and

•

acquisitions of technologies, product lines or companies.

We develop software products that are designed to operate on a variety of
operating systems. We typically develop new products and enhancements of
existing products through focused product development groups. Each product
development group is responsible for its own design, development, documentation
and quality assurance. Our research and development expenditures for each of
the last three years are further discussed under “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Research and
Development Expenses”.

Independent contractors are used for aspects of the product development
process. In addition, elements of some of our products are licensed from third
parties.

We invest in companies with emerging technologies and companies that promote
the sale and use of our products and services. These investments are made in
lieu of an acquisition when timing is inappropriate or when the business models
and sectors fall out of our strategic requirements. We pursue investments,
which we believe will be complementary and can enhance both financial returns
and market growth.

We use strategic acquisitions as necessary to provide certain technology,
people and products for our overall product and services strategy. We consider
both time to market and potential market share growth when evaluating
acquisitions of technologies, product lines or companies. We have completed a
number of acquisitions of technologies, companies and products in the past, and
have also disposed of technologies and products. We may acquire and/or dispose
of other technologies, companies and products in the future. For further
discussion on our acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 3 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Competition

Our markets are competitive and are subject to rapid changes in technology.
They are influenced by the constant change in Internet security threats and the
strategic direction of major software and operating system providers, network
equipment and computer hardware manufacturers, Internet service providers,
application service providers and key application software vendors. Our
competitiveness depends on our ability to deliver products that meet our
customers’ needs by enhancing our existing solutions and services and offering
reliable, scalable and standardized new solutions on a timely basis. We have
limited resources, and as a result, we must deploy our available resources
thoughtfully. The principal competitive factors in our Consumer
Products, Enterprise Security and
Enterprise Administration segments are quality,
employment of the most advanced technology, time to market, price, reputation,
financial stability, breadth of product offerings, customer support, brand
recognition, and sales and marketing teams. In our Services segment, the
principal competitive factors include technical capability, customer
responsiveness, price, ability to attract and retain talented and experienced
personnel, financial stability, and reputation within the industry.

In the enterprise security and administration markets, we compete against many
companies who offer competing products to our technology solutions and
competing services to our response and support. In the area of antivirus and
filtering products, some of the companies we compete against are Computer
Associates, McAfee Security (formerly Network Associates), Sophos, Trend Micro,
and WebSense. In addition, Microsoft has announced its intent to offer Service
Pack 2, which checks for active and current anti-virus software on desktops and
refers the user to software vendors. In the area of firewall and



VPN, some of the companies we compete against are Check Point Software, Cisco,
Juniper, SonicWALL and Watchguard. In the area of intrusion detection and
security management, some of the companies we compete against are Bindview,
Internet Security Services, NetIQ and Tipping Point. In the areas of remote
management, imaging provisioning, backup, recovery and asset management, some
of the companies we compete against are Altiris, Laplink, Marimba and Veritas.
In addition, we face indirect or potential competition from operating system
providers and network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers, who
provide or may provide various security solutions and functions in their
current and future products. These competitors have significant advantages due
to their ability to influence or control the computing platforms, security
layers and network tiers on, or in, which security products operate. In
addition, these competitors generally have significantly greater financial,
marketing or technological resources than we do. We believe that our ability to
compete in the enterprise security and administration markets going forward
depends in part on providing simplified, solution-oriented offerings that
address multiple aspects of enterprise security.

Some of the companies that offer competing products to our Consumer Products
offerings include Check Point Software, Internet Security Services, Kroll, McAfee Security (formerly
Network Associates), Norman, Panda and Trend Micro. With
the recent outbreaks of viruses and other Internet-based security threats,
several other companies have entered the market and may become significant
competitors in the future.

Our Enterprise Security Services compete with companies such as Counterpane,
IBM, Internet Security Services, Ubizen and Verisign.

Price competition is intense with most of our products and services. We expect
price competition to continue to increase and become even more significant in
the future, which may reduce our profit margins.

We also face competition from a number of other products that offer levels of
functionality different from those offered by our products, or that were
designed for a somewhat different group of end-users than those targeted by us.
Microsoft has added security features to new versions of its operating system
products that provide some of the same functions offered in our products.
Microsoft’s acquisition of GeCad’s antivirus technology could lead it to
include antivirus functions in future versions of its operating system
products. In addition, vendors of other operating systems, such as Red Hat®
Linux, Solaris and Unix-based operating systems, may also incorporate some of
the advanced utilities or other functionality offered in our products. While we
plan to continue to improve our products with a view toward providing enhanced
functionality over that provided in current and future operating systems, these
efforts may be unsuccessful and any improved products may not be commercially
accepted by users. We will also continue to attempt to cooperate with operating
system vendors to make our products compatible with those operating systems,
while at the same time, differentiating our utility products from features
included in those operating systems. Our efforts in this regard may be
unsuccessful.

The demand for some of our products, including those currently under
development, may decrease if, among other reasons:

•

Microsoft includes additional product features in future releases of
Windows;

•

hardware vendors, including Cisco, incorporate additional
server-based network management and security tools into network
operating systems;

•

Microsoft, network equipment or computer hardware manufacturers
license, develop or acquire technology or products that provide
functionality directly competitive with our product and service
offerings.

In addition, we compete with other computer software companies, operating
system providers and network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers for
access to retail distribution channels and for the attention of customers at
the retail level and in corporate accounts. We also compete with other software
companies, operating system providers and network equipment and computer
hardware manufacturers to acquire products or companies and to publish software
developed by third parties.

Some of our existing and potential competitors have greater financial,
marketing or technological resources than we do. We believe that competition in
the industry will continue to intensify as other major software companies
expand their product lines into additional product categories, and as operating
system providers, network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers attempt
to leverage their strengths at the computing platform, security layer and
network tier to compete more aggressively in the market for security solutions.

Manufacturing

Our product development groups produce a set of master CD-ROMs or diskettes and
documentation for each product that is then duplicated or replicated and
packaged into products by our logistics organization. United States purchasing
of all raw materials is done by an outside organization. This outside
contractor, under the supervision of our domestic logistics
organization,
performs all of our domestic manufacturing and order fulfillment. The
manufacturing steps that are



subcontracted to outside organizations include the replication of CD-ROMs,
printing of documentation materials and retail boxes, and assembly of the final
packages. Purchasing is done by Symantec personnel for products manufactured in
our Dublin, Ireland facilities. For most products distributed outside of North
and South America, our Dublin, Ireland manufacturing facility performs diskette
duplication, assembly of the final packages, and order fulfillment. Our Dublin,
Ireland manufacturing facility also subcontracts to outside organizations for
the replication of CD-ROMs and printing of documentation materials and retail
boxes.

Intellectual Property

We regard our software as proprietary. We attempt to protect our software
technology by relying on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret and
trademark laws, restrictions on disclosure and other methods. In particular, we
have a substantial number of registered trademarks and currently hold a
substantial number of patents in the United States, as well as patent holdings
in other countries, which expire at various times over the next twenty years.
We regularly file other applications for patents and trademarks in order to
protect proprietary intellectual property that we believe are important to our
business. We also license some intellectual property from third parties for use
in our products.

We face a number of risks relating to our intellectual property, including
unauthorized use and unauthorized copying, or piracy, of our software
solutions. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property
rights, to protect trade secrets or trademarks or to determine the validity and
scope of the proprietary rights of others. Patents that have been issued to us
could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against
competitive products in every jurisdiction. Furthermore, other parties have
asserted and may, in the future, assert infringement claims against us. For
further discussion on our current litigation, see Note 15 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. These claims and any litigation may result
in invalidation of our proprietary rights. Litigation, even if not meritorious,
could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management
attention. In addition, third party licenses may not continue to be available
to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.

Employees

As of March 31, 2004, we employed approximately 5,300 people worldwide,
including approximately 2,800 in sales, marketing and related staff activities
(with approximately 800 employees in our direct sales force), 1,300 in product
development, 300 in services and 900 in management, manufacturing,
administration and finance. In connection with the relocation of our Leiden,
Netherlands operations to Dublin, Ireland in early fiscal year 2003, a group of
employees in the Leiden facility joined a union to negotiate the proposed terms
of the transfer of operations to our Dublin facility, focusing primarily on
severance benefits for employees that did not relocate to Dublin. Except for
these terminated employees, no other employees are represented by a labor
union. We believe that relations with our employees are good.

North America

In addition to the above properties, we lease 25 properties in North America (principally in
the United States) for which the square footage is individually insignificant, but which total 195,000 square feet in the aggregate.
Of the properties we own and lease in North America, we are attempting to sublease facilities of approximately 167,000 square feet
while facilities of approximately 248,000 square feet are subleased to third parties. We are currently building a facility in
Culver City, which we expect to occupy in 2007. In addition, with the acquisition of ON Technology, we expect to consolidate our Waltham, Massachusetts
site and the site acquired through ON Technology into one main site. We expect this to be finalized during fiscal 2005.

In March 2003, we terminated our operating lease obligations for four facilities located in
Springfield, Oregon, Newport News, Virginia and two in Cupertino,
California by purchasing the land and buildings for $124 million.

International

In addition to the above properties, we lease 58 properties outside of North America (principally in
Europe) for which the square footage is individually insignificant,
but which total 364,000 square feet in the aggregate. Of the properties we own and
lease in EMEA, we are attempting to sublease facilities of approximately 32,000 square feet while facilities of approximately 16,000 square
feet are subleased to third parties.

We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for current needs and that
the productive capacity in such facilities is substantially being utilized.

On January 16, 2001, the Board of Directors replaced an earlier stock
repurchase program with a new authorization to repurchase up to $700 million of
Symantec common stock, not to exceed 60.0 million shares, with no expiration
date. On January 20, 2004, the Board of Directors increased the dollar amount
of the company’s authorized stock repurchase program from $700 million to $940
million, without any specific limit on the number of shares to be repurchased.
In connection with the additional $240 million authorization, we adopted a
repurchase plan under Rule 10b5-1 and intend to repurchase $60 million of shares during
each calendar 2004 quarter.

During fiscal 2004, we repurchased 1.5 million shares under the amended stock
repurchase program, at prices ranging from $39.03 to $41.63 per share, for an
aggregate amount of $60 million. During fiscal 2003, we repurchased 4.4 million
shares at prices ranging from $13.97 to $14.98 per share, for an aggregate
amount of $64 million. During fiscal 2002, we repurchased 19.3 million shares
at prices ranging from $8.89 to $12.25 per share, for an aggregate amount of
$204 million. As of March 31, 2004, $367 million remained authorized for future
repurchases, of which $180 million is expected to be utilized through the 10b5-1 plan
through December 2004.

Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

Symantec is the global leader in information security providing a broad range
of software, appliances and services designed to help individuals, small and
mid-sized businesses, and large enterprises secure and manage their IT
infrastructure. Symantec’s Norton brand of products is the worldwide leader in
consumer security and problem-solving solutions. Founded in 1982, we have
offices in 38 countries worldwide.

We have a 52/53-week fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references as of
and for the periods ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 reflect amounts as of
and for the periods ended April 2, 2004, March 28, 2003, and March 29, 2002,
respectively. The fiscal accounting year ended April 2, 2004, is comprised of
53 weeks of operations while the fiscal accounting years ended March 28, 2003
and March 29, 2002 each is comprised of 52 weeks of operations. The fiscal
accounting year ending April 1, 2005 will comprise of 52 weeks of operations.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes
requires us to make estimates, which include judgments and assumptions, that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our
estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate our estimates on a
regular basis and make changes accordingly. Historically, our estimates
relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from
actual results, however actual results may differ from these estimates under
different conditions.

A critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about
matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Different
estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in accounting
estimates could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that the
estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates, as they
have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.
We also refer you to our “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” beginning
on page 52 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles that have been prescribed for the software industry. Revenue
recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and they
require us to make many estimates.

In applying our revenue recognition policy, we must determine which portions of
our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred. In
order to determine current and deferred revenue, we make estimates with regard
to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate pricing for
those products and services. Our estimates regarding future products and
services could differ from actual events.

We defer revenue relating to products, primarily in our Consumer Products and
Enterprise Administration segments, that we have shipped into our distribution
and reseller channels to the extent that inventory levels are in excess of
certain specified inventory levels for these channels. We defer this revenue as
an offset to accounts receivable. We estimate the excess inventory in these
channels by analyzing channel inventory levels and distribution and reseller
sell-through trends obtained from our channel partners, as well as various
historical trends on a product basis. In addition, we consider other factors in
assessing these specified inventory levels, such as product seasonality,
current market conditions, economic trends, existing security threats and
timing of new product releases. On the same basis, we defer the associated cost
of revenues related to this deferred revenue. If we made different estimates,
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues
and cost of revenues for any period presented.

In arrangements that include multiple elements, including perpetual software
licenses and maintenance and/or services, and packaged products with content
updates, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on
vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered
elements, and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and
the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. Our deferred revenue
consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance
and consumer product content updates and totaled $971 million as of March 31,
2004, of which $92 million was represented as long-term deferred revenue, on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. VSOE of each element is based on the price for



which the undelivered element is sold separately. We determine fair value of
the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand-alone sales
of these elements to third parties. When VSOE does not exist for undelivered
items such as maintenance, then the entire arrangement fee is
recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes to the elements in a
software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair
value of the respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated life
cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue.

Reserves for Product Returns

End-users may return our products, primarily within our Consumer Products and
Enterprise Administration segments, through distributors and resellers or to us
directly for a full refund within a reasonably short period from the date of
purchase. Our estimated reserves for such end-user product returns, which are
recorded as an offset to revenue, are based primarily on historical trends. We
also consider other factors such as the timing of upgrades and new versions of
products, current market conditions, economic trends and changes in technology.
In addition, we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution
channels as an offset to revenue. If we made different estimates, material
differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any
period presented. More or less product may be returned from what was estimated
and/or the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is
estimated. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry
environment could make our return estimates differ from actual results.

Reserves for Rebates

We estimate and record reserves as an offset to revenue for channel and
end-user rebates, related primarily to products within our Consumer Products,
Enterprise Security and Enterprise Administration segments. Our estimated
reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and
resellers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume
incentive rebate programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our
reserves for end-user rebates are estimated on the terms and conditions of the
promotional programs, actual sales during the promotion, amount of actual
redemptions received, historical redemption trends by product and by type of
promotional program and the value of the rebate. We also consider current
market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates.
If we made different estimates, material differences may result in the amount
and timing of our net revenues for any period presented.

Business Combinations

When we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets
and liabilities acquired and identifiable intangible assets. Any residual
purchase price is recorded as goodwill. We engage independent third-party
appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. Such a valuation requires management to make significant
estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are
based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of
the acquired companies. These estimates can include, but are not limited to,
the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the
appropriate weighted average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to
be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain
and unpredictable. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may
occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates.

At March 31, 2004, goodwill was $1.1 billion, acquired product rights was $121
million, and other identifiable intangible assets was $10 million. We assess the impairment
of goodwill within our reportable units
annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable. We assess the impairment of
acquired product rights and other identifiable intangible
assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized
when the sum of the discounted future net cash flows expected to result from
the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying
amount. Such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the
carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. The estimate of cash flow is
based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future
operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by our
management. Our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash
flows due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to the business
model or changes in operating performance. If we made different estimates,
material differences may result in write-downs of net long-lived and intangible
assets, which would be reflected by charges to our operating results for any
period presented.

Accounting for Excess Facilities



We have estimated expenses for excess facilities related to consolidating,
moving and relocating various groups or sites as a result of restructuring
activities and business acquisitions. In determining our estimates, we
obtained information from third party leasing agents to calculate anticipated
third party sublease income and the vacancy period prior to finding a
sub-lessee. Market conditions will affect our ability to sublease facilities on
terms consistent with our estimates. Our ability to sublease facilities on
schedule or to negotiate lease terms resulting in higher or lower sublease
income than estimated will affect our accrual for site closures. Differences
between estimates of related broker commissions, tenant improvements and
related exit costs may increase or decrease our accrual upon final negotiation.
If we made different estimates regarding these various components of our excess
facilities costs, the amount recorded for any period presented could vary
materially from those actually recorded.

Income Taxes

We make significant estimates to determine our current provision for income
taxes, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities and our income taxes
payable. Our estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take
into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and
possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and
domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws
and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact
the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial position and results of
operations.

We also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be
realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon future
United States taxable income and future taxable income in certain foreign
jurisdictions, as well as our implementation of prudent and feasible tax
planning strategies. Our estimates regarding future profitability may change
due to future market conditions, changes in United States or international tax
laws and other factors. To the extent we believe it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of our net deferred tax assets will not be realized,
we establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. To the
extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period,
we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax
provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Legal Contingencies

From time to time, we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary
course of business, and we do not expect this trend to change in the future. We
are currently involved in the legal proceedings as discussed in Note 15 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

When the likelihood of the incurrence of costs related to our legal proceedings
is probable and management has the ability to estimate such costs, we provide
for estimates of external legal fees and any probable losses through charges to
our Consolidated Statements of Operations. These estimates have been based on
our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and
are subject to change based upon new information and intervening events. Our
accrual for legal contingencies as of March 31, 2004 represented insignificant
amounts related to external legal fees and no amounts were accrued for probable
losses, as we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against
us, and we will defend ourselves vigorously. However, even if we are
successful, estimated costs for external legal fees could be more than
anticipated. And, if we are unsuccessful, we might be forced to pay
significant damages and licensing fees, or modify our business practices for
which we have not accrued any amounts for loss contingencies. Any such results
could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse
impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



Results of Operations

Overview

Our goal for fiscal 2004 was to continue serving customer needs while reshaping
the competitive landscape by offering integrated solutions.

Within the Consumer Products segment, we grew our base of individual users and
accelerated our expansion into the small business market. In addition, we
released new versions of our award winning consumer products, including Norton
Internet Security, Norton AntiVirus, Norton™ Personal Firewall, Norton AntiSpam™
and Norton SystemWorks, which includes Norton™ Password Manager. These new
products provide protection from viruses, intrusion attempts and piracy
threats, and offer expanded protection from emerging threats.

Within the Enterprise Security segment, we continued to enhance and expand our
product portfolio in order to address the evolving threat environment with the
release of our new line of integrated solutions: the Symantec Gateway Security,
Symantec Deep Sight Threat Management System, Symantec Enterprise Security
Manager, Symantec Incident Manager and Symantec ManHunt. In addition, we maintained our
focus on delivering strong integrated solutions, enhanced manageability, and
more comprehensive intrusion protection.

Within the Enterprise Administration segment, sales of our pcAnywhere product
continued to decline and we expect this trend to continue due to the extended
functionality of Microsoft operating system products. Conversely, the
Enterprise Administration segment benefited from our new product introductions
related to our business acquisitions of ON Technology and PowerQuest in the
second half of fiscal 2004.

Net revenue during fiscal 2004 increased as compared to fiscal 2003 due
primarily to increased sales of our consumer and enterprise security products,
which can be attributable to the numerous security threat outbreaks that
occurred during fiscal 2004, including the Beagle, Welchia, Blaster, Sobig,
MyDoom and Netsky viruses. In addition, increased demand for our security
protection solutions from large organizations as well as from small businesses
and consumers also contributed to the growth.

Net revenue during fiscal 2003 increased as compared to fiscal 2002 due
primarily to increased sales of our consumer and enterprise security products,
which can be attributable to the numerous security threat outbreaks that
occurred during fiscal 2003, including the Code Red, Nimda, Klez, Bugbear and
Slammer viruses.

From a regional standpoint, sales outside of the United States contributed
strongly to revenue growth while sales in the United States also grew during
these periods. Strength in major foreign currencies during fiscal 2004 and
fiscal 2003 also positively impacted our international revenue growth.

A significant portion of our deferred revenue balance of $590 million as of
March 31, 2003 contributed to our total net revenues during fiscal 2004.
Deferred revenue increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due
primarily to increased maintenance obligations. We anticipate that
approximately one-third of our deferred revenue balance of $971 million as of
March 31, 2004 will contribute to our net revenues during the June 2004
quarter.

Headcount during fiscal 2004 increased as compared to fiscal 2003 due primarily
to the growth of the company and due to business acquisitions. Of this
increase, approximately 60% was due to the growth of the company and
approximately 40% was due to business acquisitions.

For total operations, net income (loss) was $371 million, $248 million and
$(28) million during fiscal year 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, or $1.07,
$0.77 and $(0.10), respectively, in diluted net income (loss) per share.

During fiscal 2004, we
acquired the following businesses and intangible assets:

•

On April 17, 2003, we purchased certain assets related to Roxio Inc.’s GoBack
computer recovery software business for $13 million in cash.

•

On July 17, 2003, we completed the acquisition of Nexland, Inc., a technology
driven Internet security company whose Internet Protocol based networking
appliances are installed at enterprise branches and telecommuter offices
worldwide, for $21 million in cash.

•

On August 6, 2003, we purchased a security technology patent as part of a
settlement in

Hilgraeve, Inc. v. Symantec Corporation

for $63 million in cash.

•

On October 15, 2003, we completed the acquisition of SafeWeb, Inc. a provider
of SSL VPN appliances, for $27



million in cash.

•

On December 5, 2003, we completed the acquisition of PowerQuest Inc., a global
provider of automated deployment and recovery solutions for corporations and
individual users, for $154 million in cash.

•

On February 13, 2004, we completed the acquisition of ON Technology Corp., a
provider of solutions which enable organizations and service providers to
manage the full lifecycle of their computing systems over corporate networks,
for an estimated $109 million in cash.

On May 19, 2004, we entered into an agreement to acquire Brightmail, Inc., a
developer of e-mail services and software for application service providers,
Internet service providers, portals and enterprises, for an estimated $370
million in cash. The acquisition is expected to close in July 2004, subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions.

Information about the various factors that management deems important in
contributing to our operating results for fiscal year 2004, 2003 and 2002 is
provided in the discussion below.

Net revenues increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due
primarily to an increase of $302 million and $143 million in sales of our
consumer and enterprise security products, respectively. The increased sales of
these products were due primarily to continuing growth in demand for our
consumer security protection products and our enterprise virus protection
solutions. We believe that a significant portion of the growth in demand during
fiscal 2004 was attributable to the numerous security threat outbreaks that
occurred during the year and may not be sustainable.

Net revenues increased during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 due
primarily to an increase of $194 million and $139 million in sales of our
consumer and enterprise security products, respectively. The increased sales of
these products were due primarily to continuing growth in demand for our virus
protection solutions from large organizations as well as from small businesses
and consumers.

Our Consumer Products segment
focuses on delivering our Internet security and problem-solving
products to individual users, home offices and small businesses. We believe that a significant portion of the growth during
fiscal 2004 was attributable to the numerous security threat outbreaks that
occurred in August 2003 and February 2004, and these growth rates may not be
sustainable. Our sales through original equipment manufacturers and sales
through our electronic distribution channel, including our subscription renewal
business, also contributed to the increase in sales during fiscal 2004. These
sales grew by $223 million in 2004 as compared to 2003. Specifically, the
increase in revenue from our Consumer Products segment during fiscal 2004 as
compared to fiscal 2003 was due primarily to increases of $188 million and $129
million in sales of our Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security products,
respectively. These increases were offset slightly by a decrease in sales of
our other consumer products.

Revenue from our Consumer Products segment increased during fiscal 2003 as
compared to fiscal 2002. Our sales through original equipment manufacturers and
sales through our electronic distribution channel, including our subscription
renewal business, contributed to the increase in sales during fiscal
2003, as we made infrastructure improvements to our online subscription renewal service at
the end of fiscal 2002. These sales grew by $154



million in 2003 as compared to 2002 as a result of increase volume and prices.
Specifically, the increase in revenue from our Consumer Products segment during
fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was due primarily to stronger than
expected consumer and small business spending, which contributed to the
increase in sales of our Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security products
in the amount of $124 million and $52 million, respectively.

as compared to fiscal 2003 due primarily to sales of PowerQuest products of
$18 million and sales of ON Technology products of $6 million, after the
respective dates of acquisition. These increases were offset by a decrease in
sales of our pcAnywhere product of $19 million. Revenue from our Enterprise Administration segment decreased during fiscal 2003
as compared to fiscal 2002 due primarily to a decrease in sales of our
pcAnywhere product of $13 million, partially offset by growth in our Ghost

respectively. In fiscal 2002, services revenues were mainly comprised of
consulting revenue of $8 million.

Net revenues from customers outside of the United States represented
approximately 52%, 49% and 47% of net revenues during fiscal year 2004, 2003
and 2002. International net revenues increased during fiscal 2004 as compared
to fiscal 2003 due primarily to sales growth of $201 million and $41 million
in the Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, region and Japan, respectively. In
addition, international revenues increased due to increased sales
of our anti-virus products in our Consumer Products and Enterprise
Security segments.

International net revenues increased during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal
2002 due primarily to sales growth of $122 million and $27 million in the EMEA
region and Japan, respectively. In addition, international net revenues
increased due to increased customer awareness related to security threats
and due to infrastructure improvements made to our online
subscription renewal service at the end of fiscal 2002, whereby
consumers are able to download software updates from the Internet.

Strength in major foreign currencies during fiscal 2004, as compared to the
average major foreign currency rates during fiscal 2003, positively impacted
our international revenue growth by $128 million due primarily to the strength
of the Euro. Strength in major foreign currencies during fiscal 2003, as
compared to the average major foreign currency rates during fiscal 2002,
positively impacted our international revenue growth by $66 million due
primarily to the strength of the Euro. We are unable to predict the extent to
which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign
currency rates. If international sales become a greater proportion of our total
sales in the future, changes in foreign exchange rates may have a potentially
greater impact on our revenues and operating results.

Gross profit represents net revenues less cost of revenues. Cost of revenues
consists primarily of costs for producing manuals and CDs, packaging costs,
fee-based technical support costs, amortization of acquired product rights,
payments to original equipment manufacturers under revenue sharing
arrangements, costs of services, royalties paid to third parties under
technology licensing agreements, and manufacturing expenses.

Gross margin remained flat at approximately 82% during fiscal year 2004, 2003
and 2002. We anticipate that our services revenues may grow and comprise a
higher percentage of our total revenues in future periods, in which case our
gross margin would likely decrease, as our services typically have higher cost
of revenues than our software products.

Acquired Product Rights

The increases in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2004 as compared
to fiscal 2003, and fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002, were due primarily
to increases in headcount and related compensation. The increased headcount
was the direct result of the growth of the Company, including business
acquisitions completed in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003.

Amortization of Goodwill

During fiscal 2002, we recorded $197 million of amortization of goodwill. In
accordance with SFAS No. 142, the carrying values of goodwill and intangible
assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized as of April 1,
2002. Therefore, there was no corresponding expense in fiscal 2004 and 2003.

Goodwill is tested for
impairment on an annual basis. We completed our annual
goodwill impairment required by SFAS No. 142 during the March 2004 quarter and
determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. We will continue to test
for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, or earlier if indicators
of impairment exist.

Acquired in-process research and development during fiscal 2004 resulted from
our acquisitions of ON Technology, PowerQuest and Nexland. Acquired in-process
research and development during fiscal 2003 resulted from our acquisitions of
Riptech, SecurityFocus and Recourse.

The efforts required to develop the acquired in-process technology principally
relate to the completion of all planning, design, development and test
activities that are necessary to establish that the product or service can be
produced to meet its design specifications including features, functions and
performance.

We determined the fair value of the acquired in-process technology for each of
the purchases by estimating the projected cash flows related to these projects
and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products. We
discounted the resulting cash flows back to their net present values. We based
the net cash flows from such projects on our analysis of the respective markets
and estimates of revenues and operating profits related to these projects.

ON Technology

The in-process technology acquired in the ON Technology acquisition consisted
primarily of research and development related to its next generation
CCM/iCommand and iPatch products, which enable organizations and service
providers to manage the full lifecycle of their computing systems over
corporate networks. We are using this technology in order to construct a common
platform for our Enterprise Administration segment products.

PowerQuest

The in-process technology acquired in the PowerQuest acquisition consisted
primarily of research and development related to its Virtual Volume Imaging
technology, which provides the capability to recover from server or desktop
failures and minimize system downtime. We are integrating this technology into
our Enterprise Administration segment product offerings.

Nexland

The in-process technology acquired in the Nexland acquisition consisted
primarily of research and development related to a next generation firewall
product. We integrated this technology into our firewall and appliance series
of products within our Enterprise Security segment.

Riptech

The in-process technology acquired in the Riptech acquisition consisted
primarily of research and development related to the fourth generation of its
Caltarian technology, which provides real-time information protection through
around-the-clock monitoring, analysis and response. We integrated this
technology into our managed security services within our Services
segment.

SecurityFocus

The in-process technology acquired in the SecurityFocus acquisition consisted
primarily of research and development related to new versions of DeepSight
Threat Management System and DeepSight Analyzer products, which are threat
management systems that provide early warnings of attack, as well as
countermeasures to defend these attacks. We integrated this technology into our
vulnerability management products within our Enterprise Security segment.

Recourse

The in-process technology acquired in the Recourse acquisition consisted
primarily of research and development related to new versions of ManHunt, a
network intrusion detection system. We integrated this technology into our
intrusion detection products within our Enterprise Security segment.

During fiscal 2004, we recorded an insignificant amount for costs of severance,
related benefits and outplacement services for a member of our senior
management team and adjustments to prior period restructuring provisions.

During fiscal 2003, we recorded $10 million for costs of severance, related
benefits and outplacement services and $3 million for costs associated with the
consolidation of certain facilities in the United States and Europe. The costs
resulted from relocating certain development, sales and finance activities,
realigning certain worldwide marketing efforts and outsourcing our North
American and European consumer support functions. As a result, we terminated
424 employees. In addition, during fiscal 2003, we recorded $2 million to
decrease prior period restructuring provisions.

During fiscal 2002, we recorded $18 million for costs associated with the
excess facilities and fixed assets associated with relocating certain sites in
the United States and Europe. We moved our operations in Newport News,
Virginia to a larger facility and we relocated our North American support group
from Eugene, Oregon to an expanded facility in Springfield, Oregon. In
addition, we consolidated our European support functions by relocating our
Leiden, Netherlands operations to Dublin, Ireland and consolidating most of our
United Kingdom facilities to one facility in Maidenhead, UK. We also recorded
$2 million of costs of severance, related benefits and outplacement services,
as we reorganized and consolidated various operating functions. As a result,
we terminated 87 employees.

For further discussion on restructuring, site closures and other, see Note 13
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Patent Settlement

In August 2003, we purchased a security technology patent as part of a
settlement in

Hilgraeve, Inc. versus Symantec Corporation

. As part of the
settlement, we also received licenses to the remaining patents in Hilgraeve’s
portfolio. The total cost of purchasing the patent and licensing additional
patents was $63 million, which was paid in cash in August 2003. Under the
transaction, we recorded $14 million of patent settlement costs in the June
2003 quarter, representing costs related to benefits received by us in and
prior to the June 2003 quarter. During the September 2003 quarter, we recorded
acquired product rights of $49 million, which are being amortized to cost of
goods sold over the remaining life of the primary patent, which expires in June
2011. There was no corresponding expense recorded during fiscal 2003 or fiscal
2002.

Litigation Judgment

During the March 2002 quarter, we accrued litigation expenses of $3 million for
post-judgment interest and other costs related to a judgment by a Canadian
court on a decade-old copyright action assumed by us as a result of our
acquisition of Delrina Corporation. For further discussion on our current
litigation, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

2001.

Other income (expense), net during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was comprised

developed technology related to the Web Access Management products due to
impairment. The December 2003 quarter payments represent the final royalty and
buy-out payments related to the divestiture of our ACT! product line as

Our effective tax rate on income before taxes was approximately 32%, 32% and
162% during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively. The higher effective tax
rate in fiscal 2002 reflects the non-deductibility of acquired in-process
research and development and substantially all of the goodwill amortization.

Realization of our net deferred tax asset at March 31, 2004 is dependent
primarily upon future United States taxable income and our implementation of
tax planning strategies. We believe it is more likely than not that the net
deferred tax assets will be realized based on historical earnings and expected
levels of future taxable income as well as the implementation of tax planning
strategies.



Levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and
uncertainties discussed in the Business Risk Factors set forth in this Item 7.
An additional valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets may be
necessary if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net
deferred tax assets will not be realized. We will assess the need for an
additional valuation allowance on a quarterly basis.

Our principal source of liquidity as of March 31, 2004 is our existing cash,

that we generate over time from our operations. During fiscal 2004, cash and
cash equivalents increased by $545 million and short-term investments increased
by $160 million. This increase is primarily due to cash provided by operations
and proceeds from the sale of common stock through our employee benefit plans,
offset by payments for business acquisitions, purchases of intangible assets and capital
expenditures.

Operating Activities

The increase in operating cash flow in fiscal 2004, as compared with fiscal
2003, was primarily the result of an increase in net income of $122 million, an
increase in deferred revenue of $123 million and an increase in income taxes
payable of $35 million. The increase in deferred revenue was due to a greater
volume and term of software maintenance agreements and the increase in income
taxes payable was due to improved profitability. The increase in operating
cashflow was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $35
million due to higher sales in the month of March 2004 compared to the month of
March 2003. The higher March 2004 sales resulted from greater sales of our
consumer and enterprise products due to the security threat outbreaks that
occurred during February 2004, including the MyDoom and Netsky viruses.

The increase in operating cash flow in fiscal 2003, as compared with fiscal
2002, was primarily the result of improved profitability. Net income increased
$277 million, however fiscal 2002 net income included a non-cash charge of $197
million for the amortization of goodwill. We ceased amortizing goodwill in
fiscal 2003 in accordance with SFAS 142. Excluding the amortization of
goodwill, net income increased $80 million in fiscal 2003, compared to fiscal
2002. The increase in operating cash flow in fiscal 2003 was also the result
of increased deferred revenue of $70 million and an increase in income taxes
payable of $39 million. The increase in deferred revenue was due to a greater
volume of software maintenance agreements and the increase in income taxes
payable was due to improved profitability. The increase in operating cashflow
was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $74 million due
to higher sales in the month of March 2003 compared to the month of March 2002
due to an unusually low net trade accounts receivable balance at March 31, 2002
as compared to the prior six quarter-end balances. In prior quarters, we had
generated a larger percentage of net revenues during the last month of each
quarter.

Investing Activities

During the past three fiscal years our investing activities have included
purchases of property and equipment, purchases of businesses and intangible assets,
and purchases and sales of short-term available-for-sale securities.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal 2004, as compared to
fiscal 2003, due primarily to a decrease in net purchases of marketable
securities of $269 million and a decrease in capital expenditures of $81
million. The higher capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 resulted from our
purchase of four of our facilities that were classified as operating leases
under synthetic lease transactions by purchasing the land and buildings. The
decrease in cash used in investing activities was also affected by a $30
million increase in cash payments for acquisitions of businesses and
intangible assets during fiscal 2004.



Net cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal 2003, as compared to
fiscal 2002, due primarily to a decrease in net purchases of marketable
securities and restricted investments of $520 million, offset by a $371 million
increase in cash payments for acquisitions of businesses and technologies and a
$51 million increase in capital expenditures during fiscal 2003.

Financing Activities

During the past three fiscal years, our financing activities have included cash
proceeds from the sale of our common stock through employee benefit plans, cash
payments for the repurchase of our common stock and the issuance of our $600
million 3% convertible subordinated notes.

Net cash provided by financing activities increased in fiscal 2004, as compared
to fiscal 2003, due to an increase of $51 million of net proceeds from the sale
of common stock through our employee benefit plans.

Net cash provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal 2003, as compared
to fiscal 2002, due to the $585 million of proceeds received upon the issuance
of our 3% convertible subordinated notes, net of debt issuance costs. This
decrease was offset by a $140 million decrease in cash spent to repurchase our
common stock.

On October 24, 2001, we completed a private offering of $600 million of 3%
convertible subordinated notes due November 1, 2006, the net proceeds of which
were $585 million. The notes are convertible into shares of our common stock
by the holders at any time before maturity at a conversion price of $17.07 per
share, subject to certain adjustments. During fiscal 2004 and 2003, an insignificant
principal amount of our notes were converted into shares of our common stock.
No shares were converted during fiscal 2002. We may
redeem the remaining notes on or after November 5, 2004, at a redemption price
of 100.75% of stated principal during the period November 5, 2004 through
October 31, 2005 and 100% thereafter. Interest is paid semi-annually and we
commenced making these payments on May 1, 2002. Debt issuance costs of $16
million related to the notes is amortized on a straight-line basis through
November 1, 2006. We have reserved 35.1 million shares of common stock for
issuance upon conversion of the notes.

On January 16, 2001, the Board of Directors replaced an earlier stock
repurchase program with a new authorization to repurchase up to $700 million of
Symantec common stock, not to exceed 60.0 million shares, with no expiration
date. On January 20, 2004, the Board of Directors increased the dollar amount
of the company’s authorized stock repurchase program from $700 million to $940
million, without any specific limit on the number of shares to be repurchased.
In connection with the additional $240 million authorization, we adopted a
repurchase plan under Rule 10b5-1 and intend to repurchase $60 million of shares during
each calendar 2004 quarter.

During fiscal 2004, we repurchased 1.5 million shares under the amended stock
repurchase program, at prices ranging from $39.03 to $41.63 per share, for an
aggregate amount of $60 million. During fiscal 2003, we repurchased 4.4 million
shares at prices ranging from $13.97 to $14.98 per share, for an aggregate
amount of $64 million. During fiscal 2002, we repurchased 19.3 million shares
at prices ranging from $8.89 to $12.25 per share, for an aggregate amount of
$204 million. As of March 31, 2004, $367 million remained authorized for future
repurchases, of which $180 million is expected to be utilized through the 10b5-1 plan
through December 2004.

Contractual Obligations

The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our
estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and
commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing
interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from
the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of
payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant
assumptions used in our information within the context of our consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The following table

We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing
of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per
unit shipped or a percentage of underlying revenue and has not been included in
the table above. Certain royalty commitments have minimum commitment
obligations; however, as of March 31, 2004 all such obligations are immaterial.

On May 21, 2004, we entered into an agreement to purchase Brightmail, Inc. for
an estimated $370 million. The completion of this acquisition is subject to
customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in
July 2004. We expect to integrate this technology into our Enterprise Security
segment.

We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as
well as cash generated from operating results will be sufficient to fund
operations for at least the next year.

Newly Adopted And Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations

. Under SFAS No. 143, the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation must be recognized in the period in which it is incurred
if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset
retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset. SFAS No. 143 became effective for Symantec beginning in the
first quarter of fiscal 2004 and the adoption of this statement did not have a
material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In December 2003, the FASB revised Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51

(FIN 46R)

,

which
addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a
controlling interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and
accordingly should consolidate the entity. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation
No. 46, which was issued in January 2003. Before concluding that it is
appropriate to apply the voting interest consolidation model to an entity, an
enterprise must first determine that the entity is not a variable interest
entity or a special purpose entity. FIN 46R became effective for Symantec
during fiscal 2004 and the adoption of this statement did not have a material
impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

, which provides
guidance for classification and measurement of certain financial instruments
with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 became
effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31,
2003, and otherwise became effective for Symantec beginning the second quarter
of fiscal 2004 and the adoption of this statement did not have a material
impact on our financial position or results of operations.



Business Risk Factors

Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results have affected our stock price
in the past and could affect our stock price in the future.

Our quarterly
operating results have fluctuated in the past, and are likely to vary
significantly in the future, based on a number of factors related to our
industry and the markets for our products. If our quarterly operating results
or our predictions of future operating results fail to meet the expectations of
analysts and investors, our stock price could be negatively affected. Factors
that are likely to cause our operating results to fluctuate include:

In addition, during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, our operating results were
materially affected by non-standard charges, including the following:

•

Acquired in-process research and development;

•

Restructuring, site closures and other charges;

•

Litigation settlements; and

•

Asset impairment charges

Any volatility in our quarterly operating results may make it more difficult
for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve
issuances of our common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into our
common stock.

There is uncertainty as to whether or not we will be able to sustain the growth
rates in sales of our products, particularly in consumer security products.

Over the last nine quarters, we experienced a higher than expected rate of
growth in sales of our consumer security protection products, and we expect
that we will not be able to sustain this high growth rate on a consistent
basis. We believe that consumer security protection sales have been spurred by
a number of factors over this period of time, including increased broadband
usage and increased awareness of security threats to consumer systems,
including the recently well publicized, Beagle, Welchia, Blaster, Sobig,
MyDoom, NetSky and Sasser viruses. The impact of these factors may diminish
over time, and it is possible that our growth rates in sales of security
protection products may decline.

We have grown, and may continue to grow, through acquisitions that give
rise to risks that could adversely affect our future operating results.

We
completed four acquisitions each during fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, and
announced an agreement to complete an acquisition in the first quarter of
fiscal 2005 and we will likely pursue future acquisitions. Integrating acquired
businesses has been and will continue to be a complex, time consuming and
expensive process. To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our
technology systems in the acquired operations and assimilate and manage the
personnel of the acquired operations. Our success in completing the integration
of acquired businesses may impact the market acceptance of such acquisitions,
and our willingness to acquire additional businesses in the future. Further,
the difficulties of integrating acquired businesses could disrupt our ongoing
business, distract our management focus from other opportunities and
challenges, and increase our expenses and working capital requirements. We may
face difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct
prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market
positions. Our acquisitions may cause us to recognize substantial amounts of
goodwill and other intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing
and amortization, and we may assume liabilities. In addition, acquisitions may
result in substantial restructuring and other related expenses and write-offs
of acquired in-process research and development costs. Further, we may need to
issue equity or incur additional debt to finance future acquisitions, which
could be dilutive to our existing stockholders or could increase our leverage.
Any of these and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated
levels of profitability from acquired operations or to realize other
anticipated benefits of an acquisition. Mergers and acquisitions of high
technology companies are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that
our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially
adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.



Introduction and integration of new products and technologies may adversely
affect our financial results.

We have recently introduced new products, such as
Symantec

TM

Enterprise Security Architecture, or
SESA

TM

, newly acquired products and
products incorporating newly acquired technology, including technologies
acquired in the following transactions:

•

On February 13, 2004, we completed the acquisition of On Technology
Corp., a provider of solutions which enable organizations and service
providers to manage the full lifecycle of their computing systems over
corporate networks.

•

On December 5, 2003, we completed the acquisition of PowerQuest
Inc., a global provider of automated deployment and recovery solutions
for corporations and individual users.

•

On October 15, 2003 we acquired SafeWeb, Inc., a provider of SSL
VPN appliances.

•

On July 17, 2003, we completed the acquisition of Nexland, Inc., a
technology driven Internet security company whose Internet Protocol
based networking appliances are installed at enterprise branches and
telecommuter offices worldwide.

These technologies may not achieve market acceptance and/or may not be able to
compete with products either currently in the market or introduced in the
future. If these technologies do not achieve market success, our financial
results, and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected.

Our efforts to develop and sell appliances and integrated solutions may not be
successful and our future net revenues and operating results could be adversely
affected.

We have been in the appliance business for a short period of time.
Because of our limited experience with the manufacturing of appliances, and
because our appliances generate lower gross margins than our software products,
our efforts to develop and sell appliances may not be as successful as we
anticipate. In addition, our strategy for future growth includes integrating
our various security technologies, management, customer service and support
into a single enterprise security solution. We have begun implementing this
strategy by selling integrated solutions, such as Symantec Gateway Security and
Symantec Client Security. Our integrated solutions may not achieve market
acceptance and may not be able to compete with solutions either currently in
the market or introduced in the future. If we are unable to achieve market
acceptance or compete effectively with solutions of our competitors, our future
net revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.

Economic conditions, and conditions affecting the network security market in
particular, may have a negative impact on our revenues and margins.

The market
for our products depends on various economic conditions including those
affecting the network security, Internet infrastructure and other related
markets. Consumer demand for our products depends, in part, on global economic
conditions. On the enterprise side, any slowdown in corporate earnings or
tightening of corporate budgets may cause potential customers to delay or
cancel security projects, reduce their overall or security-specific information
technology budgets, or reduce or cancel orders for our products. Further, if
economic conditions deteriorate, customers may experience financial difficulty,
cease operations or fail to budget for the purchase of our products. This, in
turn, may lead to longer sales cycles, price pressures and collection issues,
causing us to realize lower revenues and margins. In addition, many parts of
the world are experiencing economic instability, and we cannot predict how
these conditions may affect our customers or business.

Our international operations involve risks, and may be subject to political or
other non-economic barriers in certain countries.

In light of recent
terrorist activity and political and military instability internationally,
governments could enact additional regulations or restrictions on the use,
import or export of encryption technologies. Further, our failure to obtain
any required export approval of our technologies, particularly our encryption
technologies, could impede our international sales. The additional regulation
of encryption technologies could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of
encryption products and public networks for secure communications. This might
decrease demand for our products and services.

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could
adversely affect our financial results.

A significant portion of our
manufacturing costs and operating expenses result from transactions outside of
the United States, often in foreign currencies. International sales comprised
approximately 52%, 49% and 47% of our total sales in fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. Although our fiscal 2004 operating results have been
positively affected by changes in foreign currency rates, our future operating
results will continue to be subject to



fluctuations in foreign currency rates, and we may be negatively affected by
fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future, especially if
international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales.

Our markets are competitive and our financial results and financial condition
could be adversely affected if we are unable to anticipate or react to this
competition.

Our markets are competitive. If we are unable to anticipate or
react to this competition, our operating results could be adversely affected by
reducing our sales or the prices we can charge for our products. Many of our
competitors have significantly lowered, and may continue to lower, the price of
their products and we may have to do the same to remain competitive. Our
ability to remain competitive depends, in part, on our ability to enhance our
products or develop new products that are compatible with new hardware and
operating systems. We have no control over, and limited insight into,
development efforts by third parties with respect to new hardware and operating
systems, and we may not respond effectively or timely to such changes in the
market. In addition, we have limited resources and we must make strategic
decisions as to the best allocation of our resources to position ourselves for
changes in our markets. We may from time to time allocate resources to projects
or markets that do not develop as rapidly or fully as we expect. We may also
fail to allocate resources to third party products, to markets or to business
models that are ultimately more successful than we anticipate.

Operating system providers and network equipment and computer hardware
manufacturers are becoming substantial competitors in the market for security
solutions, which could adversely affect our financial results.

Large operating
system providers and network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers with
significantly greater financial, marketing or technological resources than we
have may leverage their strengths at the computing platform, security layer and
network tier levels to compete more aggressively in the market for security
solutions. Our failure to adapt effectively to the continued development,
acquisition, or licensing of security solutions technology or product rights by
one or more of these competitors could negatively impact our competitive
position in the market for security solutions.

For example, the continued inclusion of security, remote access or virus
protection tools in new operating systems and hardware packages could adversely
affect our sales. In particular, Microsoft has added security and remote access
features to new versions of its operating system products that provide some of
the same functions offered in our products. This competition may decrease or
delay the demand for certain of our products, including those currently under
development. Furthermore, as hardware vendors incorporate security functions
in their network equipment or integrate security within their network and
system management products, the demand for some of our products may decrease,
including those currently under development.

The trend toward consolidation in the software industry could impede our
ability to compete effectively.

Consolidation is underway among companies in
the software industry as firms seek to offer more extensive suites and broader
arrays of software products, as well as integrated software and hardware
solutions. Changes resulting from this consolidation may negatively impact our
competitive position. In addition, to the extent that we seek to expand our
product lines, managerial and technical personnel skills and capacity through
acquisitions, the trend toward consolidation may result in our encountering
competition, and paying higher prices, for acquired businesses.

Demand for our products is subject to seasonal trends, which could make our
stock price more volatile.

Although there is no assurance this trend will
continue, our sales of consumer products have been seasonal, with higher sales
generally in our December and March quarters. To the extent seasonality makes
it more difficult to predict our revenues and value our business, our stock
price may suffer and the volatility of our stock may increase.

Military actions around the globe could create economic conditions that reduce
demand for our products and services by businesses, consumers and government
agencies.

Political and military instability could slow spending within our
target markets, delay sales cycles and otherwise adversely affect our ability
to generate revenue and operate effectively. Government demand for our products
and services is dictated by budgetary cycles and funding availability and this
demand may be adversely affected by a redirection of spending for military or
other objectives.

Our financial forecasts may not be achieved, due to the unpredictability of
end-of-period buying patterns, which could make our stock price more volatile.

The risk of quarterly fluctuations is increased by the fact that a significant
portion of our quarterly net revenues has historically been generated during
the last month of each fiscal quarter. Most resellers have tended to make a
majority of their purchases at the end of a fiscal quarter. In addition, many
enterprise customers negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter. Due
to these end-of-period buying



patterns, forecasts may not be achieved, either because expected sales do not
occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable
to us. This increases the chances that our results could diverge from the
expectations of investors and analysts, which could make our stock price more
volatile.

Increased reliance on sales of enterprise licenses may result in greater
fluctuations in, or otherwise adversely affect, our financial results.

Sales
of enterprise licenses through our Enterprise Security segment represent a
major portion of our business. Enterprise licensing arrangements involve a
longer sales cycle than sales through other distribution channels, require
greater investment of resources in establishing the enterprise relationship,
may involve greater pricing pressure and sometimes result in lower operating
margins. In addition, the timing of the execution of volume licenses, or their
non-renewal by large customers, could cause our results of operations to vary
significantly from quarter to quarter and could have a material adverse impact
on our results of operations. In addition, longer license periods impede our
ability to increase prices due to increased costs and may adversely impact our
operating margins.

If we are unable to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace,
the growth and success of our business could be adversely affected.

We believe
that our future success will depend in part on our ability to recruit and
retain highly skilled management, sales, marketing and technical personnel. To
accomplish this, we believe that we must provide personnel with a competitive
compensation package, including stock options. Increases in shares available
for issuance under our stock options plans require stockholder approval in many
cases, and institutional stockholders, or stockholders generally, may not
approve future increases. Additionally, the FASB proposed a new standard that
would require companies to include compensation expense in their statement of
operations relating to the issuance of employee stock options. As a result, we
may decide to issue fewer stock options and may be impaired in our efforts to
attract and retain necessary personnel.

We are dependent upon certain partners to distribute our products and we would
be adversely affected if these relationships terminate or diminish.

A large
portion of our enterprise sales are made through value-added and other
resellers, and a large portion of our consumer sales are made through the
retail distribution channel. Reliance on these channels subjects us to events
that cause unpredictability in demand. This increases the risk that we may not
plan effectively for the future, which could result in adverse operating
results in future periods. Our distribution partners may also offer our
competitors’ products. Their decisions to sell our products are partly a
function of pricing, terms and special promotions offered by our competitors
and other factors that we do not control and cannot predict. Our agreements
with partners are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated by them or by us
without cause. We would be adversely affected if companies in our partner
program chose to sell greater amounts of competitive offerings relative to the
amount they sell of our offerings.

In addition, we sell our consumer products through original equipment
manufacturers, or OEMs, who bundle our antivirus and other products with their
PCs. We continuously seek to establish new OEM relationships and, conversely,
may encounter OEMs that decide either to replace third party security software
with their own or switch to a competitor’s product. When we lose an OEM
relationship, our consumer sales could be adversely affected unless and until
we are able to establish new relationships of similar significance.

Some distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past,
and may experience them in the future. If these partners do suffer financial
difficulties, we may have reduced sales or increased write-offs, which would
adversely affect our operating results.

If we are unable to effectively adapt to changes in the dynamic technological
environment, our future revenues and operating results could be adversely
affected.

We are increasingly focused on the Internet security market, which,
in turn is dependent on further acceptance and increased use of the Internet.
The following critical issues concerning the use of the Internet remain
unresolved and may affect the market for our products and the use of the
Internet as a medium to distribute or support our software products and the
functionality of some of our products: security; reliability; cost; ease of
use; accessibility; quality of service; and potential tax or other government
regulations.

In addition, new technologies are gaining acceptance. We must adapt to these
changing technological demands. If we are unable to timely assimilate changes
brought about by the Internet and wireless based environments, our future net
revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.



Our research and development efforts may be more costly and time-consuming than
anticipated and the results may be unsuccessful, which could adversely impact
our financial results.

We will need to continue to incur significant research
and development expenditures in future periods as we strive to remain
competitive. The length of our product development cycle for new products and
product enhancements has frequently been greater than we originally expected,
and we are likely to experience delays in future product development. In
addition, a portion of our development efforts has not been technologically
successful and certain products have not achieved market acceptance. As a
result, the products we are currently developing or may develop in the future
may not be technologically successful, achieve market acceptance or compete
effectively with products of our competitors.

Our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of computer
configurations, which could result in errors or product failures.

Because we
offer very complex products, undetected errors, failures or bugs may occur when
they are first introduced or when new versions are released. Our products often
are installed and used in large-scale computing environments with different
operating systems, system management software and equipment and networking
configurations, which may cause errors or failures in our products or may
expose undetected errors, failures or bugs in our products. In the past, we
have discovered software errors, failures and bugs in certain of our product
offerings after their introduction and have experienced delays or lost revenues
during the period required to correct these errors. Our customers’ computer
environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and
non-standard configurations that make pre-release testing for programming or
compatibility errors very difficult and time-consuming. Despite testing by us
and by others, errors, failures or bugs may not be found in new products or
releases after commencement of commercial shipments. Errors, failures or bugs
in products released by us could result in negative publicity, product returns,
loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products or claims by customers or
others. In addition, if an actual or perceived breach of network security
occurs in one of our end customer’s security systems, regardless of whether the
breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of the
effectiveness of our products could be harmed. Because the techniques used by
computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not
be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate
these techniques. Alleviating any of these problems could require significant
expenditures of our capital and resources and could cause interruptions, delays
or cessation of our product licensing, which could cause us to lose existing or
potential customers and would adversely affect results of operations.

Most of our license agreements with customers contain provisions designed to
limit our exposure to potential product liability claims. It is possible,
however, that these provisions may not prove effective in limiting our
liability.

Product returns may negatively affect our net revenues.

Product returns can
occur when we introduce upgrades and new versions of products or when
distributors or retailers have excess inventories, subject to various
contractual limitations. Our return policy allows distributors, subject to
these contractual limitations, to return purchased products in exchange for new
products or credit towards future purchases. End-users may return our products
for a full refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase.
Future returns could exceed the reserves we have established for product
returns, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

Increased customer demands on our technical support services may adversely
affect our financial results.

We may be unable to respond quickly enough to
short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We also may be
unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in
support services provided by competitors. Further customer demand for these
services, without corresponding revenue could increase costs and adversely
affect our operating results.

We have outsourced the majority of our worldwide consumer support
functions. As such, we are highly dependent on the on-going business success of
the companies with whom we have contracted to provide these services. If these
companies experience financial difficulties, do not maintain sufficiently
skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts or otherwise fail to
perform at a sufficient level under these contracts, the level of support
services to our customers may be significantly disrupted, which could
materially harm our relationships with these customers.

Our inability to timely distribute our products and services over the Internet,
including security patches and updated virus definitions via our LiveUpdate
feature, could adversely affect our business.

Our ability to maintain and
increase the speed with which we provide services to consumers and to increase
the scope of these services is limited by and dependent upon the speed and
reliability of the Internet. As we incorporate the LiveUpdate technology into
more of our products, we are increasingly reliant on the Internet as a means to
distribute our security patches and updated virus definitions to our customers.
Accordingly, if we, or our customers, are unable to utilize the



Internet due to a failure of technology, infrastructure or other reasons, our
ability to provide services may suffer, which could lead to a decrease in
revenues. In addition, the infrastructure required to support the increase in
on-line sales may be insufficient, if our on-lines sales increase at a rate
significantly greater than anticipated.

Terrorist activity could target the Internet, computer systems and networks,
and security providers, which could adversely affect our ability to generate
revenue.

Any significant interruption of the Internet, computer systems and/or
networks could adversely impact our ability to rapidly and efficiently provide
anti-virus and other product updates to our customers.

Our software products and web site may be subject to intentional disruption,
which could adversely impact our reputation and future sales.

Although we
believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional
disruptions, we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed
to impede the performance of our products. Similarly, experienced computer
programmers, or hackers, may attempt to penetrate our network security or the
security of our web site and misappropriate proprietary information or cause
interruptions of our services. Uninterrupted online availability of our web
site is becoming increasingly important, as online subscription renewals
comprise a larger portion of our revenues. Our activities could be adversely
affected, and our reputation and future sales harmed, if these intentionally
disruptive efforts are successful.

We are subject to litigation that could adversely affect our financial results.

From time to time, we are subjected to product liability claims, including
claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, as
well as other legal claims incidental to our business. We are currently
involved in a number of lawsuits, all of which we intend to defend vigorously.
However, it is possible that we could suffer an unfavorable outcome in one or
more of these cases. Depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable
resolutions of these lawsuits, our future results of operations or cash flows
could be materially adversely affected in a particular period.

Although infringement claims may ultimately prove to be without merit, they are
expensive to defend and may consume our resources or divert our attention from
day-to-day operations. If a third party alleges that we have infringed their
intellectual property rights, we may choose to litigate the claim and/or seek
an appropriate license from the third party. If we engage in litigation and the
third party is found to have a valid patent claim against us and a license is
not available on reasonable terms, our business, operating results and
financial condition may be materially adversely affected. For example, in the
June 2003 quarter, we paid $63 million in relation to the Hilgraeve technology
patent settlement, of which $14 million was charged to operating expenses in
the June 2003 quarter, and the remainder was capitalized and will be amortized
to cost of revenues through June 2011.

Piracy of our software may have a significant adverse impact on our net
revenues.

Although we are unable to quantify the extent of piracy of our
software products, software piracy may depress our net revenues. While this
would adversely affect revenue domestically, lost revenue is believed to be
even more significant outside of the United States, particularly in countries
where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. We engage in
efforts to educate consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and
to educate lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual
property rights are protected, and we cooperate with the Business Software
Alliance in their efforts to combat piracy. However, these efforts may not
affect the piracy of our products.

Our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be adequately
protected from all unauthorized uses, which could adversely impact our
financial results.

We regard our software and underlying technology as
proprietary. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of
confidentiality agreements and copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret
laws. Third parties may copy aspects of our products or otherwise obtain and
use our proprietary information without authorization or develop similar
technology independently. All of our products are protected by copyright laws,
and we have a number of patents and patent applications pending. We may not
achieve the desired protection from, and third parties may design around, our
patents. In addition, existing copyright laws afford limited practical
protection. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the
same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the United
States, and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products. Any legal
action that we may bring to protect proprietary information could be expensive
and may distract management from day-to-day operations.

We continue to make substantial changes to our information systems that could
disrupt our business and our financial results.

We plan to continuously improve
our Enterprise Resource Planning, Customer Relationship Management and Data
Warehouse Information systems to support the form, functionality and scale of
the business.



These types of transitions frequently prove disruptive to the underlying
business of an enterprise and may cause us to incur higher costs than we
anticipate. Failure to manage a smooth transition to the new systems and the
ongoing operations and support of the new systems could materially harm our
business operations.

In addition, our order management and product shipping centers are
geographically dispersed. A business disruption could occur as a result of
natural disasters or the interruption in service by communications carriers. If
our communications between these centers are disrupted, particularly at the end
of a fiscal quarter, we may suffer an unexpected shortfall in net revenues and
a resulting adverse impact on our operating results. Communication outages,
Internet connectivity disruptions, and/or increased volumes of electronic
distribution transactions may also cause delays in customer access to our
Internet-based services or product sales.

We hold minority interests in non-public companies and if these companies face
financial difficulties in their operations, our investments could be impaired
and could adversely affect our financial results.

We continue to hold minority
interests in privately held companies. These investments are inherently risky
because these companies are still in the development stage and depend on third
parties for financing to support their ongoing operations. In addition, the
markets for their technologies or products are typically in the early stages
and may never develop. If these companies do no have adequate cash funding to
support their operations, or if they encounter difficulties developing their
technologies or products, our investments in these companies may be impaired
and could adversely affect our financial results.

We may be subject to a higher effective tax rate that could negatively affect
our financial results and financial position.

Our effective tax rate could be
adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our
control. Our future effective tax rate could be unfavorably affected by
unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing
statutory tax rates. We are also subject to changes in tax laws or their
interpretations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate which may
adversely impact our effective tax rate. In addition, our effective tax rate
could be affected by the changes in accounting and tax treatment of stock-based
compensation.

If the carrying value of our long-lived assets is not recoverable, an
impairment loss must be recognized which would adversely affect our financial
results.

We evaluate our long-lived assets, including property and equipment,
goodwill, acquired product rights and other intangible assets, whenever events
or circumstances occur which indicate that these assets might be impaired. In
addition, goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment in the fourth quarter
of each fiscal year, regardless of events and circumstances. We will continue
to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets,
and we may incur substantial impairment charges, which could adversely affect
our financial results.



Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in market prices,
interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates. We use certain derivative
financial instruments to manage these risks. All financial instruments used are
in accordance with our global investment policy and global foreign exchange
policy. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

We also hold equity interests in ten privately-held companies. These
investments were recorded at cost, and are classified as other long-term assets
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are inherently risky and
we could lose our entire initial investment in these companies. As of March 31,
2004, these investments had an aggregate carrying value of $11 million.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

We consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with an original
maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. All of our cash equivalents
and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale securities as
of the balance sheet dates. Our available-for-sale securities are reported at
fair market value and any unrealized gains and losses are included as a
component in Stockholders’ Equity in Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our cash equivalents and short-term
investments consist primarily of corporate securities, taxable auction rate
securities, US government and government-sponsored securities and money market
funds.

The following table presents the fair value and hypothetical changes in fair
market values of our significant financial instruments held as of March 31,
2004 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions):

Interest Rate Increase (Decrease) of X Basis Points (bps)

The modeling technique used above measures the change in fair market value
arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes
reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of minus 75
basis points, minus 25 basis points, plus 50 basis points, plus 100 basis
points and plus 150 basis points, which are representative of the movements in
the United States Federal Funds Rate, Euro Area ECB Rate and Canada Overnight
Rate.

Exchange Rate Sensitivity

We conduct business in 30 international currencies through our worldwide
operations. We believe that the use of foreign exchange forward contracts
should reduce the risks that arise from conducting business in international
markets.

We hedge risks associated with certain foreign currency cash, investments,
receivables and payables in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign
currency fluctuations on these assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies. Foreign exchange forward contracts as of March 31, 2004 were as
follows (in millions):

$


We believe that these foreign exchange forward contracts do not subject us to
undue risk from the movement of foreign exchange rates because gains and losses
on these contracts are offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and
liabilities. All contracts have a maturity of no more than 35 days. Gains and
losses are accounted for as other income (expense), net each period. We
regularly review our hedging program and may make changes as a result of this
review.

Item 9: Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

In September 2002, we dismissed Ernst & Young LLP as our independent auditors
and engaged KPMG LLP as our new independent auditors to audit our financial
statements for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004 and 2003. We filed a
current report on Form 8-K on September 23, 2002, reporting these events.

The report of Ernst & Young LLP for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002
contained no adverse opinions, disclaimer of opinion or qualification or
modification as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

We have had no disagreements with our accountants on any accounting or
financial disclosures.



Item 9A: Controls and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

The Securities and
Exchange Commission defines the term “disclosure controls and procedures”
to mean a company’s controls and other procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it
files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the Commission’s rules and forms. Our chief executive officer and our
chief financial officer have concluded, based on the evaluation of the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures by our management,
with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief
financial officer, as of the end of the period covered by this report,
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective for this
purpose.

(b)

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

. There was no
change in our internal control over financial reporting during our
fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial
reporting.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements




REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Symantec Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Symantec
Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of March 31, 2004 and 2003, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years in the
two-year period ended March 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) for each of the years
in the two-year period ended March 31, 2004. These consolidated financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Symantec
Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the two-year
period ended March 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule for each of the years in the two-year period ended March 31, 2004,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 142 (“SFAS No. 142”),

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

, as of April 1, 2002. As described in Note 4, these consolidated
financial statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures
required by SFAS No. 142. In our opinion, the disclosures for 2002 in Note 4
are appropriate. As described in Note 16, the disclosures in the notes to the
2002 consolidated financial statements relating to reportable segments have
been restated. We audited the adjustments that were applied to restate the
disclosures for reportable segments reflected in the 2002 consolidated
financial statements. In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have
been properly applied. As described in Notes 17 and 18, the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended March 31, 2002 have been revised
to reflect the reclassification of certain amounts to achieve comparability
with the 2004 financial statement presentation. In our opinion, the
reclassifications for 2002 are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to
audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2002 consolidated financial
statements of Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries other than with respect to
such aforementioned disclosures and reclassifications, and accordingly, we do
not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2002 consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole.

SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Symantec Corporation (“we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Symantec Corporation and
all of its subsidiaries) is the global leader in information security providing
a broad range of software, appliances and services designed to help
individuals, small and mid-sized businesses, and large enterprises secure and
manage their IT infrastructure. Symantec’s Norton brand of products is the
worldwide leader in consumer security and problem-solving solutions. Founded in
1982, we have offices in 38 countries worldwide.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Symantec Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Acquisitions and
Divestitures

During the three years ended
March 31, 2004, we acquired the following businesses:

Each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly,
their operating results have been included in our consolidated financial
statements since their respective dates of acquisition.

In August 2001, we sold
assets and transferred liabilities and employees related to our Web
Access Management product line to PassGo Technologies, Ltd. and agreed to license them the related
technology for a period of four years through August 2005. In
December 1999, we licensed substantially all of the ACT! Product line
technology to Interact Commerce Corporation for a period of four years through December 2003.

See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion.

Fiscal
Years

We have a 52/53-week fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all references as of
and for the periods ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 reflect amounts as of
and for the periods ended April 2, 2004, March 28, 2003, and March 29, 2002,
respectively. The fiscal accounting year ended April 2, 2004, comprised of 53
weeks of operations while the fiscal accounting years ended March 28, 2003 and
March 29, 2002 each comprised of 52 weeks of operations. The fiscal accounting
year ending April 1, 2005 will comprise 52 weeks of operations.

Symantec share and per share amounts in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements retroactively
reflect the two-for-one stock split effected as a stock dividend, which
occurred on November 19, 2003.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using
the exchange rate on the balance sheet dates. The translation adjustments
resulting from this process are included as a component of stockholders’ equity
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Revenues and expenses are
translated using average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of net
income (loss). Deferred tax assets (liabilities) are established on the
cumulative translation adjustment attributable to unremitted foreign earnings
that are not intended to be indefinitely reinvested.

Revenue Recognition

We derive revenue primarily from sales of packaged products, perpetual license
agreements, product maintenance and services, and recognize this
revenue when the following conditions have
been met:



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

We sell packaged software products through a multi-tiered distribution channel.
We also sell electronic download and packaged products, via the Internet. We
separately sell annual content update subscriptions directly to end-users
primarily via the Internet. We defer package product revenue on all
distribution and reseller channel inventory in excess of specified inventory
levels in these channels. We defer the portion of revenue from package and
electronic download products related to content updates. Revenue related to
content updates is deferred and recognized ratably over the year that such
updates are provided. We offer the right of return of our products under
various policies and programs with our distributors, resellers and end-user
customers. We estimate and record reserves for end-user product returns as an
offset to revenue.

We offer channel and end-user rebates for products within our Enterprise
Security, Enterprise Administration and Consumer Products segments. Our
estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on
distributors’ and resellers’ actual performance against the terms and
conditions of volume incentive rebate programs, which are typically entered
into quarterly. Our reserves for end-user rebates are estimated on the terms
and conditions of the promotional program, actual sales during the promotion,
amount of actual redemptions received, historical redemption trends by product
and by type of promotional program and the value of the rebate. We estimate and
record reserves for channel and end-user rebates, and we account for these
reserves as an offset to revenue.

We enter into perpetual software license agreements through direct sales to
customers and indirect sales with distributors and resellers. The license
agreements generally include product maintenance agreements, for which the
related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the
agreements.

Our services include managed security services, consulting and education. We
recognize managed security services revenue ratably over the period that such
contracted services are provided. We recognize consulting services revenue as
services are performed or upon written acceptance from customers, if
applicable. We recognize education services revenue as services are performed.

In arrangements that include multiple elements, including perpetual software
licenses and maintenance and/or services and packaged products with content
updates, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on
vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered
elements, and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and
the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. Our deferred revenue
consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance
and consumer product content updates.

VSOE of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is
sold separately. We determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on
historical evidence of our stand-alone sales of these elements to third
parties. When VSOE does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance, then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the
performance period.

Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments

We consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with an original
maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Our short-term investments,
classified as available-for-sale as of the respective balance sheet dates, are
reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included
in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Stockholders’ Equity on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Realized gains and losses and declines in value
judged to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are included
in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The
cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.

Trade Accounts Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not
interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for
potentially uncollectible trade receivables. We also review our trade



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

receivables by aging category to identify specific customers with known
disputes or collectibility issues. We exercise judgment when determining the
adequacy of these reserves as we evaluate historical bad debt trends, general
economic conditions in the United States and internationally, and changes in
customer financial conditions.

Equity Investments

We have equity investments in privately held companies for business and
strategic purposes. These investments are included in Other long-term assets on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are accounted for under the cost method as
we do not have significant influence over these investees. Under the cost
method, the investment is recorded at its initial cost and is periodically
reviewed for impairment. We regularly review our investees’ actual and
forecasted operating results, financial position and liquidity, and business
and industry factors in assessing whether a decline in value of an equity
investment has occurred that is other than temporary. When such a decline in
value is identified, the fair value of the equity investment is estimated based
on the preceding factors and an impairment loss is recognized in Other income
(expense), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We utilize some natural hedging to mitigate our foreign currency exposures and
we manage certain residual exposures through the use of one-month forward
foreign exchange contracts. We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts
with high-quality financial institutions primarily to minimize currency
exchange risks associated with certain balance sheet positions
denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and
losses on the contracts are included in Other income (expense), net in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations in the period that gains and losses on the
underlying transactions are recognized. The gains and losses on the contracts
generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying transactions. The fair
value of forward foreign exchange contracts approximates cost due to the short
maturity periods.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is principally
determined using currently adjusted standards, which approximate actual cost on
a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory consists of raw materials and finished
goods.

Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements

Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, net of
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is
provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
respective assets as follows:

•

computer hardware and software – two to three years;

•

office furniture and equipment – three to five years;

•

leasehold improvements - the shorter of the lease term or seven years; and

•

buildings - twenty five to thirty years.

Acquired Product Rights

Acquired product rights are comprised of purchased product rights,
technologies, databases and revenue related order backlog and contracts from
acquired companies. Acquired product rights are stated at cost less accumulated
amortization. Amortization of acquired product rights is provided on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets,
generally one to five years, and is primarily included in Cost of revenues in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. On April 1, 2002, we adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 142,

Goodwill and
Other Intangibles.

As a result, the net balance of workforce-in-place, that was
previously included in acquired product rights, was reclassified to goodwill
and is no longer amortized, but is subject to impairment testing at least
annually.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No.
142. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and identifiable intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for
impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets
with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful
lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with
SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.
On April 1, 2002, we ceased the amortization of goodwill, in accordance with
SFAS No. 142, and will test goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently
if events and circumstances warrant.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

Long-Lived Assets

On April 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 144 which requires that long-lived and
intangible assets, including property, equipment, leasehold improvements and
acquired product rights, be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the
undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. Such impairment
loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the
asset and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of would be separately
presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount
or fair value less costs to sell, and no longer depreciated. The assets and
liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented
separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance
sheet. The adoption of this standard did not have an effect on our financial
position or our operating results.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is computed using the liability method, under
which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and of net operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the periods. Diluted net income (loss) per
share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the
periods. Potentially dilutive common shares include the assumed conversion of
all of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes and assumed exercising of
stock options using the treasury stock method, if dilutive in the period.
Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded in net loss periods, as their
effect would be antidilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

We elected to follow APB No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, in
accounting for our employee stock options because the alternative fair value
accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

, requires the use of option valuation models that were not
developed for use in valuing employee stock options.

We account for stock-based compensation awards to employees using the intrinsic
value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion, or APB,
No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and to nonemployees using the
fair value method in accordance with SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

. In addition, we apply applicable provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Interpretation No. 44,

Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation

, an interpretation of APB No.
25. Our stock plans are described in Note 12. Under APB No. 25, because the
exercise price of our employee stock options generally equals the market price
of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is
recognized in our consolidated financial statements.

Pro forma information regarding net income (loss) and net income (loss) per
share is required by SFAS No. 123. This information is required to be
determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options, including
shares issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, collectively called
options, granted subsequent to March 31, 1995 under the fair value method of
that statement. The following table illustrates the effect on net income (loss)
and net income (loss) per share as if we had applied the fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation for each of the
three years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:

The weighted average estimated fair values of employee stock options granted
during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $17.45, $11.18 and $10.33 per share,
respectively. The weighted average estimated fair value of employee stock
purchase rights granted under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002 were $10.18, $8.93 and $7.28, respectively.

For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of the options
was amortized to expense over the options’ vesting period, for employee stock
options, and the six-month purchase period, for stock purchases under the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Options assumed as a result of our acquisition of
AXENT Technologies were not included in the estimated fair value. Shares
purchased through the AXENT Purchase Plan subsequent to the closing date of the
AXENT acquisition were included in the estimated fair value and were
included in the pro forma information above.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Our product revenues are concentrated in the software industry, which is highly
competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes in the
industry or customer requirements, or the emergence of competitive products
with new capabilities or technologies, could adversely affect operating
results. In addition, a significant portion of our revenues and net income
(loss) is derived from international sales and independent agents and
distributors. Fluctuations of the United States dollar against foreign
currencies, changes in local regulatory or economic conditions, piracy or
nonperformance by independent agents or distributors could adversely affect
operating results.

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments and trade
accounts receivable. Our investment portfolio is diversified and consists of
investment grade securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit
risk exposure to any one issuer and in any one country. We are exposed to
credit risks in the event of default by the issuers to the extent of the amount
recorded on the balance sheet. The credit risk in our trade accounts receivable
is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process, reasonably short
collection terms and the geographical dispersion of sales transactions. We
maintain reserves for potential credit losses and such losses have been within
management’s expectations.

Legal Expenses

We accrue estimated legal expenses when the likelihood of the incurrence of the
related costs is probable and management has the ability to estimate such
costs. If both of these conditions are not met, management records the related
legal expenses when incurred. Amounts accrued by us are not discounted. The
material assumptions used to estimate the amount of legal expenses include:

•

the monthly legal expense incurred by our external attorneys on the
particular case being evaluated;

•

communication between us and our external attorneys on the expected
duration of the lawsuit and the estimated expenses during that time;

•

our strategy regarding these lawsuits;

•

deductible amounts under our insurance policies; and



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued

•

past experiences with similar lawsuits.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

We report comprehensive income or loss in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 130,

Reporting Comprehensive Income,

which establishes standards for
reporting comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements.
The components of other comprehensive income (loss) consist of unrealized gains
and losses on marketable securities, net of taxes and foreign currency
translation adjustments, net of taxes. Unrealized gains and losses on our
available-for-sale securities is immaterial for all periods presented.
Comprehensive income (loss) and the components of accumulated other
comprehensive income are presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statements
of Stockholders’ Equity.

Newly Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations

. Under SFAS No. 143, the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation must be recognized in the period in which it is incurred
if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset
retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset. SFAS No. 143 became effective for Symantec beginning in the
first quarter of fiscal 2004 and the adoption of this statement did not have a
material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In December 2003, the FASB revised Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51

(FIN 46R)

,

which
addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a
controlling interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and
accordingly should consolidate the entity. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation
No. 46 , which was issued in January 2003. Before concluding that it is
appropriate to apply the voting interest consolidation model to an entity, an
enterprise must first determine that the entity is not a variable interest
entity or a special purpose entity. FIN 46R became effective for Symantec
during fiscal 2004 and the adoption of this statement did not have a material
impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

, which provides
guidance for classification and measurement of certain financial instruments
with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 became
effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31,
2003, and otherwise became effective for Symantec beginning the second quarter
of fiscal 2004 and the adoption of this statement did not have a material
impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Reclassifications

Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current financial statement presentation with no impact on net income (loss).

Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures

Fiscal 2004 Acquisitions

During fiscal 2004, we acquired two public and two privately-held companies for
a total of $311 million in cash, including acquisition-related expense
resulting from financial advisory, legal and accounting services and duplicate
sites and severance costs. Approximately $5 million of acquisition-related
expenses remains as an accrual as of March 31, 2004. We expect that the
acquisition of these emerging technologies will strengthen our competitive
position in the enterprise administration and enterprise security markets. The
results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in our
operations as of the dates of acquisition. ON Technology Corp. and PowerQuest,
Inc. are included in our Enterprise Administration segment, and SafeWeb, Inc.
and Nexland, Inc. are included in our Enterprise Security segment. For details
of the purchase price allocations, refer to Table 3.1 below.

ON Technology

On February 13, 2004, we acquired ON Technology, a global provider of
enterprise infrastructure management solutions, for $109 million in cash,
including $7 million of acquisition-related expenses. We expect the acquisition
to strengthen our competitive position in the enterprise administration market
by allowing us to provide a unified solution that will help customers create a
secure enterprise infrastructure. ON Technology’s software distribution and
configuration management capabilities will be a critical component to the
end-to-end system Symantec is establishing to help customers build, manage and
protect their IT infrastructures.

PowerQuest

On December 5, 2003, we acquired PowerQuest, a global provider of automated
deployment and recovery solutions for corporations and individual users, for
$154 million in cash, including $4 million of acquisition-related expenses. We
expect the acquisition to strengthen our competitive position in the enterprise
administration market by enabling us to deliver solutions that allow customers
to build, manage and protect their IT infrastructures with end-to-end security
management capabilities.

SafeWeb

On October 15, 2003, we acquired SafeWeb, a provider of SSL VPN appliances, for
$27 million in cash, including minimal acquisition-related expenses. We expect
the acquisition to strengthen our competitive position in the enterprise
security market by allowing us to offer SafeWeb’s Secure Extranet Appliance
technology designed to reduce the cost and complexity of deploying, managing
and maintaining secure access to remote users.

Nexland

On July 17, 2003, we acquired Nexland, an Internet security company whose
Internet Protocol based networking appliances are installed at enterprise
branches and telecommuter offices worldwide, for $21 million in cash,
including minimal acquisition-related expenses. We expect the acquisition to
strengthen our competitive position in the enterprise security solutions market
as it is expected to allow us to further develop Symantec integrated solutions.

Fiscal Year 2003 Acquisitions

During fiscal 2003, we acquired four privately-held companies for a total of
$382 million in cash, including acquisition-related expenses resulting from
financial advisory, legal and accounting services and duplicate sites and
severance costs. These acquisitions helped strengthen our competitive position
in the enterprise security solutions and managed security services markets. The
results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in our
operations as of the dates of acquisition. These acquired companies are
included in our Enterprise Security segment, with the exception of Riptech,
Inc., which is included in our Services segment. For details of the purchase
price allocations, including subsequent adjustments, see Table 3.2 below.

Riptech

On August 19, 2002, we acquired Riptech, a provider of scalable, real-time
managed security services that protect clients through advanced outsourced
security monitoring and professional services, for $148 million in cash,
including $3 million of acquisition-related expenses. During the 12 months
subsequent to the acquisition, we revised estimates related to certain
liabilities, and as a result, we decreased the purchase price and goodwill by
$1 million.

Recourse

On August 19, 2002, we acquired Recourse Technologies, Inc., a provider of
security threat management solutions that detect, analyze and respond to both
known and novel threats, including intrusions, internal attacks and denial of
service attacks, for $139 million in cash, including $3 million of
acquisition-related expenses. During the 12 months subsequent to the
acquisition, we revised estimates related to certain liabilities, and as a
result, we decreased the purchase price and goodwill by $1 million.

SecurityFocus

On August 5, 2002, we acquired SecurityFocus, Inc., a provider of enterprise
security threat management systems, providing global early warning of cyber
attacks, customized and comprehensive threat alerts, and countermeasures to
prevent attacks before they occur, for $76 million in cash, including minimal
acquisition-related expenses. During the 12 months subsequent to the
acquisition, we revised estimates related to certain liabilities, and as a
result, we decreased the purchase price and goodwill by an immaterial amount.

Mountain Wave

On July 2, 2002, we acquired Mountain Wave, Inc., a provider of automated
attack sensing and warning software and services for real-time enterprise
security operations management, for $21 million in cash, including minimal
acquisition-related expenses.

Fiscal Year 2002 Acquisitions

During fiscal 2002, we acquired one privately-held company and one company
division for a total of $4 million in cash, which was recorded as goodwill in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We acquired Lindner & Pelc Consult GmbH, a
security services and implementation company in Berlin, Germany, for $2
million in cash and the



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued

enterprise security management division of Foster-Melliar Limited, an IT services company located in Johannesburg, South
Africa for $2 million in cash. The results of operations of the acquired
company and division have been included in our operations as of the dates of
acquisition. These acquired companies are included in our Services segment.

Under the terms of both acquisition agreements, we were liable for contingency
payments based on targeted future sales through fiscal 2004. During fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002, we paid insignificant amounts of contingency payments in
accordance with these agreements, which was recorded as compensation expense.

Accounting for Intangible Assets

Acquired
IPR&D

In connection with our acquisitions described above, we wrote off acquired
in-process research and development of $4 million and $5 million in fiscal 2004
and 2003, respectively, because the acquired technologies had not reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative uses. The efforts required to
develop the acquired in-process technology principally related to the
completion of all planning, design, development and test activities that were
necessary to establish that the product or service could be produced to meet
its design specifications, including features, functions and performance. We
determined the fair value of the acquired in-process technology for these
purchases by estimating the projected cash flows related to the projects and
future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products. We
discounted the resulting cash flows back to their net present values. We based
the net cash flows from such projects on our analysis of the respective markets
and estimates of revenues and operating profits related to these projects.

Acquired Product Rights

In connection with our acquisitions described above, the amounts allocated
to acquired product rights are being amortized to cost of revenues over their
useful lives of one to five years.

Other Intangibles

In connection with our acquisitions described above, the amounts allocated
to other intangibles include customer relationships, tradenames, and customer
lists, and are being amortized to operating expenses over their useful lives of
one to seven years.

See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a schedule of
other intangibles as of March 31, 2004 and 2003, including the value and useful
life by category.

Divestitures

Web Access Management Product Line

On August 24, 2001, we sold assets and transferred liabilities and employees
related to our Web Access Management product line to PassGo Technologies, Ltd.
We also entered into an exclusive license and option agreement with PassGo
whereby they licensed our Web Access Management technology products. In
consideration for the license, PassGo is required to pay us quarterly royalties
based on their net revenue starting at 30% and declining to 10% over a
four-year period through August 2005. Because the royalties are not guaranteed
and the quarterly amounts to be received are not determinable until earned, we
recognized these royalties as payments were due. The pre-tax gain on the
divestiture, the subsequent royalties received, and the amortization of the
developed technology related to the Web Access Management products has been
recorded in Income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and has been immaterial. During
fiscal 2003, we wrote off $3 million of developed technology related to the
Web Access Management product line due to impairment, which was also recorded
in Income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Income and expenses related to Web
Access Management product line are provided in Table 3.3 below on a net basis.

PassGo has an option to purchase the technology at a price starting at $18.8
million and declining to $3.3 million over a four-year period through August
2005. As of March 31, 2004, PassGo had not exercised their option to purchase.

ACT! Product Line

On December 31, 1999, we licensed substantially all of the ACT! product line
technology to Interact Commerce Corporation for a period of four years through
December 2003. In consideration for the license, Interact was required to pay
us quarterly royalty payments. Because the royalties were not guaranteed and
the quarterly amounts to be received were not determinable until earned, we
recognized these royalties as payments were due. At the end of the four-year
period, Interact had an exclusive option to purchase the licensed technology
from us for $60 million less all royalties paid to us to date. In December
2003, Interact exercised its option and we transferred the technology to them.
Royalties, including the December 2003 purchase payment, are provided in Table
3.3 below.

Note 4. Goodwill, Acquired Product Rights and Other Intangible Assets

With the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we ceased the amortization of goodwill and
recharacterized acquired workforce-in-place (and the related deferred tax
liability) as goodwill on April 1, 2002. Accordingly, there was no amortization
of goodwill and acquired workforce-in-place during fiscal 2004 and 2003.

The following table presents a reconciliation of previously reported net income
(loss) and net income (loss) per share to the amounts adjusted for the
exclusion of the amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce-in-place, net
of the related income tax effect:

On August 6, 2003, we purchased a security technology patent as part of a
settlement in

Hilgraeve, Inc. v. Symantec Corporation

. As part of the
settlement, we also received licenses to the remaining patents in Hilgraeve’s
portfolio. The total cost of purchasing the patent and licensing additional
patents was $63 million, which was paid in cash in August 2003. Under the
transaction, we recorded $14 million of patent settlement costs in the June
2003 quarter that was deemed related to benefits received by us in and prior to
the June 2003 quarter. In addition, we recorded $49 million for acquired
product rights in the September 2003 quarter. The acquired product rights are
being amortized to cost of revenues over the remaining life of the primary
patent, which expires in June 2011.

On April 17, 2003, we purchased acquired product rights related to Roxio Inc.’s
GoBack computer recovery software business for $13 million in cash. The
acquired product rights will be amortized to cost of revenues over their
estimated useful life of three years.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued

During fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, amortization expense for acquired product
rights was $42 million, $32 million and $32 million, respectively.
Amortization of acquired product rights was included in Cost of revenues in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations, except for an immaterial amount related
to the divested Web Access Management product line, which was included in
Income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product lines in the
Statement of Operations. The future annual amortization expense for acquired
product rights, based upon our existing acquired product rights and their
current useful lives, is estimated to be the following as of March 31, 2004:

Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were reported as a
component of Stockholders’ Equity and were immaterial for all periods
presented.

Equity
Investments in Privately Held Companies



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued

As of March 31, 2004 and 2003, we held equity investments with a carrying value
of $11 million in several privately held companies. These investments were
recorded at cost as we do not have significant influence over the investee and
are classified as Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
During fiscal 2004 and 2003 we recognized a decline in value of these
investments determined to be other-than-temporary of $3 million and $1
million, respectively. During fiscal 2003 and 2002, declines in our
unregistered equity investment value were immaterial. The other than temporary
declines in fair value were recorded as Other expense, net on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

During the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements, we did not
use any derivative instrument for trading purposes. We utilize some natural
hedging to mitigate our exposures and we manage certain residual balance sheet
exposures through the use of one-month forward foreign exchange contracts. We
enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions
primarily to minimize currency exchange risks associated with certain balance
sheet positions. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts
approximates cost due to the short maturity periods. As of March 31, 2004, the
notional amount of our forward foreign exchange contracts was $113 million,
all of which mature in 35 days or less. We do not hedge our foreign currency
translation risk.

Note 6. Convertible Subordinated Notes

On October 24, 2001, we completed a private offering of $600 million of 3%
convertible subordinated notes due November 1, 2006, the net proceeds of which
were $585 million. The notes are convertible into shares of our common stock
by the holders at any time before maturity at a conversion price of $17.07 per
share, subject to certain adjustments. During fiscal 2004 and 2003, an
insignificant principal amount of our notes were converted into shares of our
common stock. No shares were converted during fiscal 2002. We may redeem the
remaining notes on or after November 5, 2004, at a redemption price of 100.75%
of stated principal during the period November 5, 2004 through October 31, 2005
and 100% thereafter. Interest is paid semi-annually and we commenced making
these payments on May 1, 2002. Debt issuance costs of $16 million, related to
the notes, are amortized on a straight-line basis through November 1, 2006. We
have reserved 35.1 million shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion
of the notes.

Note 7. Commitments

We lease certain of our facilities and equipment under operating leases that
expire at various dates through 2018. We currently sublease some space under
various operating leases that will expire at various dates through 2012.

respectively, and immaterial amounts thereafter.

Rent expense charged to operations totaled $27 million, $25 million and $25
million during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

In March 2003, we terminated our operating lease obligations for four
facilities located in Cupertino, California, Springfield, Oregon, and Newport
News, Virginia by purchasing the land and buildings for $124 million.

Note 8. Stock Dividend

On October 22, 2003, our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split
of Symantec’s common stock



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued

effected in the form of a stock dividend. Shareowners of record at the close of
business on November 5, 2003 were issued one additional share of common stock
for each share owned as of that date. The stock split increased the number of
total shares outstanding from 154 million shares to 308 million shares. The
additional shares resulting from the stock dividend were issued in book-entry
form on November 19, 2003. Symantec share and per share amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements retroactively reflect the
two-for-one stock split effected as a stock dividend, which occurred
on November 19, 2003.

Note 9. Common Stock Repurchases

On January 16, 2001, the Board of Directors replaced an earlier stock
repurchase program with a new authorization to repurchase up to $700 million of
Symantec common stock, not to exceed 60.0 million shares, with no expiration
date. On January 20, 2004, the Board of Directors increased the dollar amount
of the company’s authorized stock repurchase program from $700 million to $940
million, without any specific limit on the number of shares to be repurchased.
In connection with the additional $240 million authorization, we adopted a
repurchase plan under Rule 10b5-1 and intend to repurchase $60 million of shares during
each calendar 2004 quarter.

During fiscal 2004, we repurchased 1.5 million shares under the amended stock
repurchase program, at prices ranging from $39.03 to $41.63 per share, for an
aggregate amount of $60 million. During fiscal 2003, we repurchased 4.4 million
shares at prices ranging from $13.97 to $14.98 per share, for an aggregate
amount of $64 million. During fiscal 2002, we repurchased 19.3 million shares
at prices ranging from $8.89 to $12.25 per share, for an aggregate amount of
$204 million. As of March 31, 2004, $367 million remained authorized for future
repurchases, of which $180 million is expected to be utilized through the 10b5-1 plan
through December 2004.

Note 11. Adoption of Stockholder Rights Plan

On August 11, 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan
designed to ensure orderly consideration of any future unsolicited acquisition
attempt to ensure fair value of us for our stockholders.

In connection with the plan, the Board of Directors declared and paid a
dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of Symantec
common stock outstanding on the record date, August 21, 1998. The rights are initially attached to Symantec common stock and will not trade
separately. If a person or a group, an Acquiring Person, acquires 20% or more
of our common stock, or announces an intention to make a tender offer for 20%
or more of our common stock, the rights will be distributed and will thereafter
trade separately from the common stock.

If the rights become exercisable, each right (other than rights held by the
Acquiring Person) will entitle the holder to purchase, at a price equal to the
exercise price of the right, a number of shares of our common stock having a
then-current value of twice the exercise price of the right. If, after the
rights become exercisable, we agree to merge into another entity or we sell
more than 50% of our assets, each right will entitle the holder to purchase, at
a price equal to the exercise price of the right, a number of shares of common
stock of such entity having a then-current value of twice the exercise price.

We may exchange the rights at a ratio of one share of common stock for each
right (other than the Acquiring Person) at any time after an Acquiring Person
acquires 20% or more of our common stock but before such person acquires 50% or
more of our common stock. We may also redeem the rights at our option at a
price of $0.001 per right at any time before an Acquiring Person has acquired
20% or more of our common stock. The rights will expire on August 12, 2008.

Note 12. Employee Benefits

401(k) Plan

We maintain a salary deferral 401(k) plan for all of our domestic employees.
This plan allows employees to contribute up to 20% of their pretax salary up to
the maximum dollar limitation prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. We match
100% of the first $500 of employees’ contributions and then 50% of the
employees’ contribution. The maximum employer match in any given plan year is
3% of the employees’ eligible compensation. Our contributions under the plan
were $7 million, $4 million and $4 million during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Restricted Shares

During fiscal 1999, we issued 400,000 restricted shares to our current CEO for
a purchase price equal to the par value of the shares at the date of
issuance, vesting 50% at each anniversary date,
with the first anniversary date being April 14, 2000. Unearned compensation
equivalent to the market value of the common stock on the date of grant, less
par, was charged to stockholders’ equity and was amortized into compensation
expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting term. As of March 31, 2004,
there were 400,000 shares fully vested and outstanding.

Stock Purchase Plans

2002 Executive Officers’ Stock Purchase Plan

In September 2002, our
stockholders approved the 2002 Executive Officers’ Stock Purchase Plan and

reserved 250,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder, of which none
are subject to adjustment pursuant to changes in capital. The purpose of the
plan is to provide executive officers with



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued

a convenient means to acquire an equity interest in Symantec at fair market
value by applying a portion or all of their respective bonus payments towards
the purchase price. Each executive officer may purchase up to 10,000 shares in
any fiscal year. As of March 31, 2004, no shares have been issued under the
plan and the entire 250,000 shares remain available for future issuance. Shares
reserved for issuance under this plan have not been adjusted for the stock
dividend.

1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In September 1998, our stockholders
approved the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and reserved 2.0 million shares
of common stock for issuance thereunder. In September 1999, the plan was
amended by our stockholders to increase the shares available for issuance by
3.0 million and to add an “evergreen” provision whereby the number of shares
available for issuance increases automatically on January 1 of each year
(beginning in 2000) by 1% of our outstanding shares of common stock on each
immediately preceding December 31 during the term of the plan, provided that
the aggregate number of shares issued over the term of the plan does not exceed
32.0 million shares. As of March 31, 2004, 12.7 million shares remain
available for issuance under the plan, including 3.1 million shares added in
connection with the “evergreen” provision on January 1, 2004 but which have not
yet been registered.

Subject to certain limitations, our employees may purchase, through payroll
deductions of 2% to 10% of their compensation, shares of common stock at a
price per share that is the lesser of 85% of the fair market value as of the
beginning of the two-year offering period or the end of the six-month purchase
period. Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan 1.4 million, 2.2 million and 1.9
million shares were issued during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
representing $23 million, $17 million and $14 million in contributions,
respectively. As of March 31, 2004, a total of 6.6 million shares had been
issued under this plan.

Stock Award Plans

2000 Director Equity Incentive Plan

In September 2000, our stockholders
approved the 2000 Directors Equity Incentive Plan and reserved 25,000 shares of
common stock for issuance thereunder, of which none are subject to adjustment
pursuant to changes in capital. The purpose of this plan is to provide the
members of the Board of Directors with an opportunity to receive common stock
for all or a portion of the retainer payable to each director for serving as a
member. Each director may elect to receive 50% to 100% of the retainer to be
paid in the form of stock. As of March 31, 2004, a total of 15,000 shares had
been issued under this plan and 10,000 shares remained available for future
issuance. Shares reserved for issuance under this plan have not been adjusted
for the stock dividend.

1994 Patent Incentive Plan

In January 1995, the Board of Directors approved
the terms of the 1994 Patent Incentive Plan and reserved 1.6 million shares of
common stock for issuance thereunder. The purpose of this plan is to increase
awareness of the importance of patents to our business and to provide employees
with incentives to pursue patent protection for new technologies that may be
valuable to us. Our executive officers are not eligible for awards under the
1994 Patent Incentive Plan, and no employee is eligible to receive more than
200,000 shares of common stock at any time during the term of the plan. As of
March 31, 2004, a total of 117,000 shares had been issued under this plan. On
March 13, 2004, the Board of Directors terminated this plan, therefore no
further shares may be issued.

Stock Option Plans

We maintain stock option plans pursuant to which an aggregate total of 62.6
million shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance as incentive and
nonqualified stock options to employees, officers, directors, consultants,
independent contractors and advisors to us, or of any parent, subsidiary or
affiliate of Symantec as the Board of Directors or committee may determine. The
purpose of these plans is to attract, retain and motivate eligible persons
whose present and potential contributions are important to our success by
offering them an opportunity to participate in our future performance through
awards of stock options and stock bonuses. Under the terms of these plans, the
option exercise price may not be less than 100% of the fair market value on the
date of grant and the options have a maximum term of ten years and generally
vests over a four-year period.

2001 Non-Qualified Equity Incentive Plan

In January 2001, the Board of
Directors approved the terms of the 2001 Non-Qualified Equity Incentive Plan
and reserved for issuance 12.0 million shares for issuance thereunder. Under
this plan, we grant options to employees, officers, directors, consultants,
independent contractors and advisors to us, or of any parent, subsidiary or
affiliate of Symantec as the Board of Directors or committee may determine.

aggregate fifty (50%) percent of all shares that are available for grant under
the plan and employees of the company who are not insiders must receive at
least fifty (50%) percent of all shares that are available for grant under the
plan. The terms of this plan are similar to those of our 1996 Equity Incentive
Plan, except that it was adopted, and may be amended, without stockholder
approval. As of March 31, 2004, 2.0 million options were outstanding under
this plan and 7.6 million remained available for future issuance.

1999 Acquisition Plan

In July 1999, the Board of Directors approved the terms
of the 1999 Acquisition Plan and reserved 2.0 million shares of common stock
for issuance thereunder. Options awarded to officers may not exceed in the
aggregate thirty (30%) percent of all shares that are available for grant under
the plan. The terms of this plan are similar to those of our 1996 Equity
Incentive Plan, except that it was adopted, and may be amended, without
stockholder approval. As of March 31, 2004, 108,000 options were outstanding
under this plan and none remain available for future issuance.

1996 Equity Incentive Plan

In May 1996, our stockholders approved the 1996
Equity Incentive Plan and reserved 16.3 million shares of common stock for
issuance thereunder. Subsequently, our stockholders approved a number of
amendments that increased the number of shares of common stock reserved for
issuance under the plan to a total of 97.8 million shares. As of March 31,
2004, 36.2 million options were outstanding under this plan and 15.3 million
remained available for future issuance.

Executive Stock Option Grants

In accordance with the employment agreement
dated April 11, 1999 between our current CEO and Symantec, the Board of
Directors approved the issuance of a non-qualified stock option to acquire
800,000 shares of common stock to the CEO. The option was granted at 100% of
the fair market value on the date of grant, has a term life of ten years and
vests over a five-year period. As of March 31, 2004, 610,000 options were
outstanding.

On December 20, 1999 a non-qualified option to acquire 80,000 shares was
approved for grant to the CEO and was deemed granted on January 1, 2000. The
option was granted at 100% of the fair market value on the date of grant, has a
term life of ten years and vests over a four-year period. As of March 31, 2004,
all options were still outstanding under this plan.

1988 Employee Stock Option Plan

The 1988 Employee Stock Option Plan was
superseded by the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan. As of March 31, 2004, 114,000
options were outstanding under the 1998 Employee Stock Option Plan and no
further option may be granted.

Acquired Stock Option Plans

We assumed stock option plans in connection with
our acquisitions of AXENT Technologies in December 2000, Delrina Corporation in
May 1996, and Central Point Software in June 1994. As of March 31, 2004,
652,000 options were outstanding under these plans and no further options may
be granted.

Fiscal 2003

During fiscal 2003, we recorded costs of severance, related benefits and
outplacement services and costs associated with the consolidation of certain
facilities in the United States and Europe. The costs resulted from relocating
certain development, sales and finance activities, realigning certain worldwide
marketing efforts and outsourcing our North American and European consumer
support functions. As a result, we terminated 424 employees. The fiscal 2003
restructuring provision was subsequently reduced as costs were lower than
anticipated.

Fiscal 2002

During fiscal 2002, we recorded costs associated with the excess facilities and
fixed assets associated with relocating certain sites in the United States and
Europe. We moved our operations in Newport News, Virginia to a larger facility
and we relocated our North American support group from Eugene, Oregon to an
expanded facility in Springfield, Oregon. In addition, we consolidated our
European support functions by relocating our Leiden, Netherlands operations to
Dublin, Ireland and consolidating most of our United Kingdom facilities to one
facility in Maidenhead, UK.

During fiscal 2002, we also recorded costs of severance, related benefits and
outplacement services, as we reorganized and consolidated various operating
functions. As a result, we terminated 87 employees. The fiscal 2002
restructuring provision was subsequently adjusted in fiscal 2003, as actual
costs were higher/(lower) than anticipated.

taxable income in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, and the
implementation of tax planning strategies. The valuation allowance increased by
$2 million during fiscal 2004 and remained unchanged during fiscal 2003.

As of March 31, 2004, we have tax credit carryforwards of $18 million that
expire in fiscal 2005 through 2022. In addition, we have net operating loss
carryforwards attributable to various acquired companies of $117 million that
expire in fiscal 2018 through 2023. These net operating loss carryforwards are
subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code §382, but are
expected to be fully realized.

Pretax income from international operations was $354 million, $225 million and
$168 million for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

No provision has been made for federal or state income taxes on $740 million
of cumulative unremitted earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries as of
March 31, 2004, since we plan to indefinitely reinvest these earnings. As of
March 31, 2004, the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was
$221 million.

Note 15. Litigation

On November 17, 2003, Health & Sport LLC filed a lawsuit on behalf of itself
and purportedly on behalf of the general public and a class including
purchasers of Norton AntiVirus 2004 and/or Norton Internet Security 2004 in the
California Superior Court, San Francisco County. The complaint alleges
violations of California Business and Professions Code 17200 and 17500 and
breach of express and implied warranties in connection with the specified
products. The complaint seeks damages and injunctive and other equitable
relief, as well as costs and attorneys’ fees. We intend to defend the action
vigorously.

On October 20, 2003, Marilyn Johnston filed a lawsuit on behalf of herself and
purportedly on behalf of the general public and an undefined class in the
California Superior Court, San Diego County. The complaint alleges violations
of California Civil Code section 1787.8 and Business and Professions Code 17200
arising from the collection of telephone number information in connection with
online credit card transactions. The complaint seeks damages and injunctive and
other equitable relief, as well as costs and attorneys fees. We intend to
defend the action vigorously.

On March 28, 2003, Ronald Pearce filed a lawsuit on behalf of himself and
purportedly on behalf of the general public of the United States and Canada in
the California Superior Court, Santa Clara County, alleging violations of
California Business and Professions Code section 17200 and false advertising in
connection with our WinFax

TM

Pro product. The complaint seeks damages and
injunctive and other equitable relief, as well as costs and attorney fees. We
intend to defend the action vigorously.

On February 27, 2003, PowerQuest filed a lawsuit against us in the United
States District Court, District of Utah, alleging that our Ghost product
infringed a patent owned by them. The complaint sought damages and injunctive
relief. The case was dismissed following Symantec’s December 2003 acquisition
of PowerQuest.

On February 7, 2003, Cathy Baker filed a lawsuit against us, Microsoft and two
retailers in the California Superior Court, Marin County, purportedly on behalf
of the general public of California and of a class of certain purchasers of
software products. An amended complaint filed in May 2003 added Greg Johnson as
plaintiff and Adobe Systems and another retailer as defendants. The complaint
alleged that our refund policies violated consumer warranty and unfair business
practice laws. The lawsuit sought damages, rescission and injunctive relief, as
well as costs and attorney fees. In April 2004, the matter was resolved with no
material payment by Symantec, and the litigation has been dismissed.

On November 29, 2002, William Pereira filed a purported class action lawsuit
against a local retailer and us in the Supreme Court of New York, New York
County, alleging breach of contract and deceptive business practices in
connection with rebates offered by us. The complaint was served March 26, 2003.
The complaint sought damages, costs and attorney fees. The parties stipulated
to dismiss the case in June 2003.

On June 14, 2002, Hark Chan and Techsearch LLC filed a lawsuit against us in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of California,
alleging that unspecified products sold on CD-ROM with Internet hyperlinks
and/or with the LiveUpdate feature infringed a patent owned by Techsearch.
Subsequently, IP Innovation LLC was added as a plaintiff. The lawsuit requested
damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorney fees. In September 2003, the
matter was resolved with no material payment by Symantec, and the litigation
has been dismissed.

On December 23, 1999, Altiris Inc. filed a lawsuit against us in the United
States District Court, District of Utah,



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, continued

alleging that unspecified Symantec products including Norton Ghost Enterprise
Edition, infringed a patent owned by Altiris. The lawsuit requests damages,
injunctive relief, costs and attorney fees. In October 2001, a stipulated
judgment of non-infringement was entered following the court’s ruling
construing the claims of the Altiris patent, and in February 2003, the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the judgment and remanded the case. We
intend to defend the action vigorously. In April 2004, we filed a lawsuit
against Altiris in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas,
alleging that several Altiris products infringe three patents owned by
Symantec.

In July 1998, the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division) ruled that we
should pay a total of $5 million for damages, plus interest, to Triolet
Systems, Inc. and Brian Duncombe in a decade-old copyright action, for damages
arising from the grant of a preliminary injunction against them. The damages
were awarded following the court’s ruling that evidence presented later in the
case showed the injunction was not warranted. We inherited this case through
our acquisition of Delrina Corporation, which was the plaintiff in this
lawsuit. Our appeal of the decision was denied, and our request for further
review of that decision was also denied. We recorded a charge of $6 million
during the June 1998 quarter, representing the unaccrued portion of the
judgment plus costs, and an additional charge of $3 million for post-judgment
interest and other costs during the March 2002 quarter. In January 2003, we
paid the judgment, interest and costs of $7 million. We expect to pay the
remaining balance of costs upon further determination by the court. As of March
31, 2004, we believe that we have adequately accrued for both the damages and
costs.

In October 1997, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for
the District of Utah on behalf of PowerQuest, against Quarterdeck, which we
acquired in March 1999. The complaint alleged that Quarterdeck’s partitioning
software, included in Partition-It

TM

and Partition-It Extra Strength, violated a
patent held by PowerQuest. In January 1998, PowerQuest obtained a second patent
relating to partitioning and amended its complaint to allege infringement of
that patent as well. PowerQuest added us as a defendant and sought an
injunction against distribution of the Partition-It and Partition-It Extra
Strength products and monetary damages. The case was dismissed following
Symantec’s December 2003 acquisition of PowerQuest.

On September 15, 1997, Hilgraeve Corporation filed a lawsuit in the United
States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan, against us, alleging that
unspecified Symantec products infringed a patent owned by Hilgraeve. The
lawsuit requested damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorney fees. In March
2000, the court granted our summary judgment motions and dismissed the case. In
September 2001, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the
summary judgment and ordered the case returned to the District Court. On August
6, 2003, Symantec acquired the asserted patent and the parties settled the
litigation. The total cost of purchasing the patent and licensing additional
patents was $63 million, which was paid in cash in August 2003.

Over the past few years, it has become common for software companies, including
us, to receive claims of patent infringement. At any given time, we are
evaluating claims of patent infringement asserted by several parties, with
respect to certain of our products. The outcome of any related litigation or
negotiation could have a material adverse impact on our future results of
operations or cash flows.

We are also involved in a number of other judicial and administrative
proceedings that are incidental to our business. We intend to defend all of the
aforementioned pending lawsuits vigorously. Although adverse decisions (or
settlements) may occur in one or more of the cases, and it is not possible to
estimate the possible loss or losses from each of these cases, the final
resolution of these lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected
to have a material adverse affect on our financial condition. We have accrued
certain estimated legal fees and expenses related to certain of these matters;
however, actual amounts may differ materially from those estimated amounts. More information
regarding how we account for our legal costs and the risks associated with our estimates can be found in our

Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

under “Legal Expenses” on
page 56 and our

Critical Accounting Estimates

under
“Legal Contingencies” on page 17.

Note 16. Segment Information

Our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer
different products and services, distinguished by customer needs. We have five
operating segments: Enterprise Security, Enterprise Administration, Consumer
Products, Services and Other.

Our Consumer Products segment
focuses on delivering our Internet security and problem-solving
products to individual users, home offices and small businesses. Our
Enterprise Security segment provides security solutions for all tiers
of a network: at the gateways between the network and the outside
world, at the servers that act as the network’s vital organs,
and at end-user devices, including desktop PCs, laptops and
handhelds. Our Enterprise Administration segment offers open and
modular products and services that enable companies to effectively
and efficiently manage their IT infrastructures. Our Services segment
provides information security solutions that incorporate advanced
technology, security best practices and expertise, and global
resources to help enable e-business success. Our Other segment is comprised of
sunset products and products nearing the end of their life cycle. Also included
in the Other segment are all indirect costs, general and administrative
expenses, amortization of goodwill (through March 31, 2002) and other
intangible assets, and other assets and charges, such as acquired in-process
research and development, legal judgments and settlements, and restructuring
and site closures which are not charged to the other operating segments.

During fiscal 2003, we realigned certain expenses within our operating
segments and reclassified fiscal 2002 information to conform to the fiscal

2003 presentation. In addition, beginning in fiscal 2003, we appropriately
presented the amortization of other intangible assets within Depreciation and
amortization expense by segment for fiscal 2002.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting polices, with the exception of the
amortization of acquired product rights, which is included entirely in our
Other segment. There are no intersegment sales. Our chief operating decision
maker evaluates performance based on direct profit or loss from operations
before income taxes not including nonrecurring gains and losses, foreign
exchange gains and losses and miscellaneous other income and expenses. The
majority of our assets and liabilities are not discretely allocated or reviewed
by segment. The depreciation and amortization of our property, equipment and
leasehold improvements are allocated based on headcount, unless specifically
identified by segment.
