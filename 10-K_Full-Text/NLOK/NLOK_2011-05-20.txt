PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Symantec is a global provider of security, storage, and systems
    management solutions that help businesses and consumers secure
    and manage their information and identities. We conduct our
    business in three geographic regions: Americas, which is
    comprised of the United States, Canada, and Latin America;
    Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia
    Pacific Japan (“APJ”).

Founded in 1982, Symantec has operations in more than 48
    countries and our principal executive offices are located at 350
    Ellis Street, Mountain View, California, 94043. Our telephone
    number at that location is

(650) 527-8000.

Our home page on the Internet is

www.symantec.com.

Other
    than the information expressly set forth in this annual report,
    the information contained, or referred to, on our website is not
    part of this annual report.

Strategy

Symantec’s strategy is to enable our customers to secure
    and manage information and identities independent of device or
    platform. We help individuals, small and medium-sized businesses
    (“SMB”), and global organizations ensure that their
    information, technology infrastructures, and related processes
    are protected and managed easily. We deliver solutions that
    allow customers to access information when they need it and make
    it available to all of those who should have access to it. In
    addition to providing customers with traditional software
    solutions, we continue to expand our Software-as-a-Service
    (“SaaS”) and appliance based offerings, giving
    customers’ choice as to how our solutions are delivered and
    deployed.

Businesses are increasingly adopting cloud, virtualization, and
    mobile technologies to reduce the cost of their IT
    infrastructures and enhance access to their information. By
    providing products and solutions that support the adoption of
    these key technology trends, we are seeking to maintain our
    leadership position in helping businesses secure and mange their
    information and identities. We have a broad portfolio of cloud
    based solutions and services, from SaaS security to
    authentication services and online backup to cloud
    infrastructure management. These products help organizations
    lower costs and simplify IT administration, while keeping their
    information and identities secure. Organizations are adopting
    virtualization to reduce costs, enhance flexibility and build
    public and private cloud infrastructures. As a result, their
    environments are becoming more complex and essential
    applications and data may be left vulnerable to attack. Our
    solutions help these organizations secure, manage and optimize
    their virtual environments from the datacenter to the endpoint.
    More and more mobile devices are being used both at work and at
    home creating new security and management challenges. Our
    solutions manage and protect mobile devices by enforcing data
    governance, increasing visibility across all mobile platforms
    and securing data for both consumers and enterprises. We are
    focused on providing consumers the best online experience that
    allows them access to information anytime, anywhere and from any
    device. Our consumer solutions take security beyond the PC and
    extend trust to new devices and consumer applications, spanning
    across mobile, smart devices, and embedded systems.

We operate primarily in three diversified markets within the
    software sector: security, backup and storage management.

The security market includes mission-critical products that
    protect consumers and enterprises from threats to electronic
    information, endpoint devices, and computer networks. The threat
    environment is rapidly changing. Attackers have become highly
    sophisticated, primarily targeting information assets. Threats
    are increasingly focused on stealing confidential information
    and identities for financial gain. The Internet has become the
    primary conduit for attack activity, with hackers increasingly
    funneling threats through legitimate websites, placing a much
    larger percentage of the population at risk than in the past.
    Data losses are not realized solely from external attacks but
    are also administered by malicious, or even well-meaning,
    insiders. Proliferation of devices and information growth is
    driving the need for a more comprehensive security framework
    that protects information and authenticates users across
    multiple platforms and devices.



The backup software market includes products that manage,
    protect, deduplicate and recover information. Effective backup
    and recovery continue to be high priority matters as
    organizations seek to better manage information growth and
    maximize operational efficiency in both physical and virtual
    environments. Enterprises are continuing to transition from tape
    to disk-based backup. To deal with the unprecedented rate of
    information growth, organizations are increasingly adopting data
    deduplication technology, a data compression technique that
    eliminates redundancies in data storage. Consumers are also
    creating unprecedented amounts of digital information that they
    want to protect. They also want to access their personal files,
    videos and pictures at any time, from anywhere and on any device.

The storage management software market includes products that
    help organizations manage heterogeneous storage infrastructure
    and run mission critical applications with confidence. Factors
    driving demand in this market include the pressure on companies
    to lower costs by optimizing storage utilization and
    accelerating cloud and virtualization adoption while keeping
    critical applications continuously available. Our new storage
    management initiatives help customers provide high-performance,
    low-cost storage in a virtualized environment.

Business
    Developments and Highlights

During fiscal 2011, we took the following actions in support of
    our business:

•

Our new consumer eCommerce platform completed its first year of
    operations and now serves customers in 230 countries, and
    supports 18 languages and 24 currencies. The benefits of an
    in-house eCommerce capability include building a closer
    relationship with our customers and enabling greater speed to
    take advantage of market trends. The ability to develop more
    targeted programs with our eCommerce platform is allowing us to
    achieve higher levels of customer renewals, better acquire new
    customers, and facilitate our up-selling and cross-selling
    efforts in our Consumer business.

•

We launched several new products and initiatives to extend our
    security leadership beyond the PC. In the consumer business, we
    launched our Norton Everywhere initiative for mobile and
    embedded devices. In the enterprise business we now offer
    solutions to manage and protect mobile devices. These solutions
    help customers enforce data governance, secure corporate data
    and increase visibility across mobile platforms.

•

We completed three acquisitions during fiscal 2011. We acquired
    the identity and authentication business of VeriSign, Inc.
    (“VeriSign”). We also acquired PGP Corporation
    (“PGP”) and GuardianEdge Technologies, Inc.
    (“GuardianEdge”), two privately-held industry leaders
    in encryption technologies. These authentication and encryption
    capabilities have strengthened our leadership position in
    security and have enhanced our ability to make data protection
    more intelligent and policy driven. We have made great strides
    in effectively integrating these acquired technologies and
    leveraging our distribution network to grow these businesses.

•

We made important advances to help customers migrate to
    next-generation information management as they transition from
    tape to disk-based backup and manage the unprecedented growth of
    unstructured information. These advances include integrating
    deduplication and archiving into our backup solutions. In
    addition, we developed and enhanced products that support VMware
    and Microsoft Hyper-V virtualization technologies and allow
    customers to reduce management complexity and operational costs
    in their virtual environments. We also launched backup
    appliances with an easy to deploy,

all-in-one

hardware and software backup solution with integrated
    deduplication.

•

In the storage management business, we launched Application High
    Availability (“AppHA”) and VirtualStore which were
    developed with the support of VMware. AppHA helps organizations
    virtualize their business critical applications and VirtualStore
    provides high-performance, low-cost storage for desktop and
    server virtualization deployments. In addition, we released our
    FileStore appliance, a clustered network attached storage
    (“NAS”) appliance that helps customers build out cloud
    storage, manage large volumes of data, and control storage costs.

•

We expanded our cloud-based offerings with the release of
    Symantec Endpoint Protection.cloud, our internally developed
    hosted endpoint protection service. We will seek to extend our
    lead in this fast growth market by delivering additional SaaS
    services such as archiving, data loss prevention and governance
    offerings.



•

We raised $1.1 billion from the issuance of senior
    unsecured notes. We also renewed our $1 billion revolving
    line of credit, extending its term for another four years.

•

We repurchased 57 million shares of our common stock for an
    aggregate amount of $870 million.

Sales and

Go-To-Market

Strategy

Our

go-to-market

network includes direct, inside, and channel sales resources
    that support our ecosystem of partners worldwide. We also
    maintain important relationships with a number of Original
    Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”), Internet Service
    Providers (“ISPs”), and retail and online stores by
    which we market and sell our products.

Consumer

We sell our consumer products and services to individuals and
    home offices globally through a network of distribution partners
    and eCommerce channels. Our products are available to customers
    through our eCommerce platform, distributors, direct marketers,
    Internet-based resellers, system builders, ISPs and more than
    30,000 retail locations worldwide. We have partnerships with 9
    of the top 10 PC OEMs globally to distribute our Internet
    security suites and with 6 of the top 10 PC OEMs globally to
    distribute our online backup offerings.

Consumer sales through our electronic distribution channel,
    which includes our Norton

e-Store,

OEMs, subscriptions, upgrades, and renewals, represented
    approximately 85 percent of consumer revenue in fiscal
    2011. The remaining 15 percent of consumer sales came from
    the retail channel.

Enterprise

We sell and market our products and related services to
    enterprise customers through our direct sales force of more than
    4,500 sales representatives and through a variety of indirect
    sales channels, which include value-added resellers, large
    account resellers, and system integrators. We also sell our
    products to businesses in more than



191 countries through authorized distributors and OEMs who
    incorporate our technologies into their products, bundle our
    products with their offerings, or serve as authorized resellers
    of our products. Symantec has nearly 300 distribution partners
    in its partner program worldwide. Our sales efforts are
    primarily targeted to senior executives and IT department
    personnel responsible for managing a company’s IT
    initiatives.

Marketing
    and Advertising

Based on the acquired VeriSign check mark, Symantec rebranded
    its logo, which unified the company brand, Norton and
    Symantec.cloud brands. The new logos are designed to identify
    our company to both consumers and businesses.

Our marketing expenditures relate primarily to advertising and
    promotion, which includes demand generation and product brand
    recognition. Our advertising and promotion efforts include,
    among other things, electronic and print advertising, trade
    shows, collateral production, and all forms of direct marketing.
    We also invest in cooperative marketing campaigns with
    distributors, resellers, retailers, OEMs, and industry partners.

We invest in various retention marketing and customer loyalty
    programs to help drive renewals and encourage customer advocacy
    and referrals. We also provide focused vertical marketing
    programs in targeted industries and countries.

We typically offer two types of rebate programs within most
    countries: volume incentive rebates to channel partners and
    promotional rebates to distributors and end users. Distributors
    and resellers earn volume incentive rebates primarily based upon
    the amount of product sales to end users. We also offer rebates
    to end users who purchase products through various resale
    channels. Both volume incentive rebates and end-user rebates are
    accrued as an offset to revenue.

Research
    and Development

Symantec embraces a global research and development
    (“R&D”) strategy to drive organic innovation.
    Engineers and researchers throughout the company pursue advanced
    projects to translate R&D into customer solutions by
    creating new technologies and integrating our unique set of
    technology assets. Symantec focuses on short, medium, and
    long-term applied research, develops new products in emerging
    areas, participates in government-funded research projects,
    drives industry standards and partners with universities to
    conduct research supporting Symantec’s strategy.

Symantec’s Security Technology and Response organization is
    a global team of security engineers, threat analysts, and
    researchers that provides the underlying functionality, content,
    and support for all enterprise, SMB and consumer security
    products. Our security experts monitor malicious code reports
    collected through the Global Intelligence Network to provide
    insight into emerging attacks, malicious code activity,
    phishing, spam, and other threats. The team uses this vast
    intelligence to develop new technologies and approaches, such as
    Symantec’s reputation-based security technology, to protect
    customer information.

Research and development expenses, exclusive of in-process
    research and development associated with acquisitions, were
    $862 million, $857 million and $870 million in
    fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, representing
    approximately 14%, 14% and 14% of revenue in the respective
    periods. We believe that technical leadership is essential to
    our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial
    resources to research and development.

Support

Symantec has centralized support facilities throughout the
    world, staffed by technical product experts knowledgeable in the
    operating environments in which our products are deployed. Our
    technical support experts assist customers with issue resolution
    and threat detection.

In fiscal 2011 and 2010 one distributor, Ingram Micro, accounted
    for 10% of our total net revenue in both periods. Our
    distributor arrangements with Ingram Micro consist of several
    non-exclusive, independently negotiated agreements with its
    subsidiaries, each of which cover different countries or
    regions. Each of these agreements is separately negotiated and
    is independent of any other contract (such as a master
    distribution agreement), and these agreements are not based on
    the same form of contract. In fiscal 2009 one reseller, Digital
    River, accounted for 10% of our total net revenue. In fiscal
    2010, we launched an internally-developed eCommerce platform
    which has reduced our reliance on Digital River.

Acquisitions

Our acquisitions are designed to enhance the features and
    functionality of our existing products and extend our product
    leadership in core markets. We consider time to market,
    synergies with existing products, and potential market share
    gains when evaluating the economics of acquisitions of
    technologies, product lines, or companies. We may acquire

and/or

dispose of other technologies, products and companies in the
    future.

During fiscal 2011, we completed the following significant
    acquisitions:

Competition

Our markets are consolidating, highly competitive, and subject
    to rapid changes in technology. We are focused on integration
    across the product portfolio and are including next-generation
    technology capabilities into our solution set to differentiate
    ourselves from the competition. We believe that the principal
    competitive factors necessary to be successful in our industry
    include time to market, price, reputation, financial stability,
    breadth of product offerings, customer support, brand
    recognition, and effective sales and marketing efforts.

In addition to the competition we face from direct competitors,
    we face indirect or potential competition from retailers,
    application providers, operating system providers, network
    equipment manufacturers, and other OEMs, who may provide various
    solutions and functions in their current and future products. We
    also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for
    spending at the retail level and in corporate accounts. In
    addition, we compete with other software companies, operating
    system providers, network equipment manufacturers and other OEMs
    to acquire technologies, products, or companies and to publish
    software developed by third parties. We also compete with other
    software companies in our effort to place our products on the
    computer equipment sold to consumers and enterprises by OEMs.

The competitive environments in which each segment operates are
    described below.



Consumer

Some of the channels in which our consumer products are offered
    are highly competitive. Our competitors are intensely focused on
    customer acquisition, which has led such competitors to offer
    their technology for free, engage in aggressive marketing, or
    enter into competitive partnerships. Our primary competitors in
    the Consumer segment are McAfee, Inc., (“MFE”) owned
    by Intel Corporation, and Trend Micro Inc. (“Trend
    Micro”). There are also several smaller regional security
    companies and freeware providers that we compete against
    primarily in the EMEA and APJ regions. For our consumer backup
    offerings, our primary competitors are Carbonite, Inc., and
    Mozy, Inc., owned by EMC Corporation (“EMC”).

Security
    and Compliance

In the security and management markets, we compete against many
    companies that offer competing products to our solutions. Our
    primary competitors in the security and management market are
    LANDesk Software, Inc., MFE, Microsoft Corporation
    (“Microsoft”), and Trend Micro. There are also several
    smaller regional security companies that we compete against
    primarily in the EMEA and APJ regions. In the authentication
    services market our primary competitors are RSA, the security
    division of EMC, Entrust, Inc., Comodo Group, Inc., and
    GoDaddy.com, Inc.

In the SaaS security market our primary competitors are Google
    Inc.’s Postini Services and Microsoft.

Storage
    and Server Management

The markets for storage management and backup are intensely
    competitive. Our primary competitors are CA, Inc., CommVault
    Systems, Inc., EMC, Hewlett-Packard Company (“HP”),
    International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”),
    Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, Inc., owned by Oracle
    Corporation.

Services

We believe that the principal competitive factors for our
    Services segment include technical capability, customer
    responsiveness, and our ability to hire and retain talented and
    experienced services personnel. Our primary competitors in the
    managed services business are IBM, and SecureWorks, Inc., owned
    by Dell, Inc.

Intellectual
    Property

Protective
    Measures

We regard some of the features of our internal operations,
    software, and documentation as proprietary and rely on
    copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws,
    confidentiality procedures, contractual arrangements, and other
    measures to protect our proprietary information. Our
    intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that
    enables us to gain recognition for our products, services, and
    technology and enhance our competitive position.

As part of our confidentiality procedures, we generally enter
    into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, distributors,
    and corporate partners, and we enter into license agreements
    with respect to our software, documentation, and other
    proprietary information. These license agreements are generally
    non-transferable and have a perpetual term. We also educate our
    employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to
    protect our facilities, equipment, and networks.

Trademarks,
    Patents, Copyrights, and Licenses

Symantec and the Symantec logo are trademarks or registered
    trademarks in the U.S. and other countries. In addition to
    Symantec and the Symantec logo, we have used, registered,

and/or

applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks
    to help distinguish our products, technologies, and services
    from those of our competitors in the U.S. and foreign
    countries and jurisdictions. We enforce our trademark, service
    mark, and trade name rights in the U.S. and abroad. The
    duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to
    country, and in the U.S. we generally are able to maintain
    our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for
    as long as the trademarks are in use.



We have more than 1,200 U.S. or foreign issued patents and
    pending patent applications, including patents and rights to
    patent applications acquired through strategic transactions,
    which relate to various aspects of our products and technology.
    The duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the
    country of issuance and for the U.S. is typically
    17 years from the date of issuance of the patent or
    20 years from the date of filing of the patent application
    resulting in the patent, which we believe is adequate relative
    to the expected lives of our products.

Our products are protected under U.S. and international
    copyright laws and laws related to the protection of
    intellectual property and proprietary information. We take
    measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary
    rights notices, and we actively enforce such rights in the
    U.S. and abroad. However, these measures may not provide
    sufficient protection, and our intellectual property rights may
    be challenged. In addition, we license some intellectual
    property from third parties for use in our products, and
    generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed
    intellectual property rights. While we believe that our ability
    to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is
    important to our success, we also believe that our business as a
    whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent,
    trademark, license, or other intellectual property right.

Seasonality

As is typical for many large software companies, our business is
    seasonal. Software license and maintenance orders are generally
    higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our
    first and second fiscal quarters. A significant decline in
    license and maintenance orders is typical in the first quarter
    of our fiscal year as compared to license and maintenance orders
    in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. In addition, we
    generally receive a higher volume of software license and
    maintenance orders in the last month of a quarter, with orders
    concentrated in the later part of that month. We believe that
    this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns
    and budget cycles, as well as the impact of compensation
    incentive plans for our sales personnel. Revenue generally
    reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than
    orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is
    shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition
    criteria are met, and because a significant portion of our
    in-period revenue is provided by the ratable recognition of our
    deferred revenue balance.

Employees

As of April 1, 2011, we employed more than
    18,600 people worldwide, approximately 46 percent of
    whom reside in the U.S. Approximately 6,700 employees
    work in sales and marketing; 6,200 in research and development;
    4,200 in support and services; and 1,500 in management,
    manufacturing, and administration.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

A description of the risk factors associated with our business
    is set forth below. The list is not exhaustive and you should
    carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before
    investing in our common stock.



Fluctuations
    in demand for our products and services are driven by many
    factors, and a decrease in demand for our products could
    adversely affect our financial results.

We are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and
    services due to a variety of factors, including general economic
    conditions, competition, product obsolescence, technological
    change, shifts in buying patterns, financial difficulties and
    budget constraints of our current and potential customers,
    levels of broadband usage, awareness of security threats to IT
    systems, and other factors. While such factors may, in some
    periods, increase product sales, fluctuations in demand can also
    negatively impact our product sales. If demand for our products
    declines, our revenues and gross margin would likely be
    adversely affected.

If we
    are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services
    that achieve widespread market acceptance, or if we are unable
    to continually improve the performance, features, and
    reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our
    business model to keep pace with industry trends, our business
    and operating results could be adversely affected.

Our future success depends on our ability to respond to the
    rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or
    introducing new products, product upgrades, and services on a
    timely basis. We have in the past incurred, and will continue to
    incur, significant research and development expenses as we
    strive to remain competitive. New product development and
    introduction involves a significant commitment of time and
    resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges
    including:

•

Managing the length of the development cycle for new products
    and product enhancements, which has frequently been longer than
    we originally expected

•

Adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to
    technological developments by our competitors and customers

•

Extending the operation of our products and services to new and
    evolving platforms, operating systems and hardware products,
    such as mobile devices.

•

Entering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited
    experience

•

Managing new product and service strategies, including
    integrating our various security and storage technologies,
    management solutions, customer service, and support into unified
    enterprise security and storage solutions

•

Addressing trade compliance issues affecting our ability to ship
    new or acquired products

•

Developing or expanding efficient sales channels

•

Obtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access
    from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to
    enable the development and deployment of interoperable products,
    including source code licenses for certain products with deep
    technical integration into operating systems

If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges,
    or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not
    technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance,
    our business and operating results could be adversely affected.

We
    operate in a highly competitive environment, and our competitors
    may gain market share in the markets for our products that could
    adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to
    decline.

We operate in intensely competitive markets that experience
    rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards,
    changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product
    introductions and improvements. If we are unable to anticipate
    or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new
    competitors gain market share in any of our markets, our
    competitive position could weaken and we could experience a drop
    in revenue that could adversely affect our business and
    operating results. To compete successfully, we must maintain an
    innovative research and development effort to develop new
    products and services and enhance existing products and
    services, effectively adapt to changes in the technology or
    product rights held by our competitors, appropriately respond to
    competitive strategies, and effectively adapt to technological
    changes and changes in the ways that our information



is accessed, used, and stored within our enterprise and consumer
    markets. If we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors
    or to changing technological and customer demands, we could
    experience a negative effect on our competitive position and our
    financial results.

Our traditional competitors include independent software vendors
    that offer software products that directly compete with our
    product offerings. In addition to competing with these vendors
    directly for sales to end-users of our products, we compete with
    them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the
    product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer
    hardware OEMs and ISPs. Our competitors could gain market share
    from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products
    with the products of our competitors or if these partners more
    actively promote our competitors’ products than our
    products. In addition, software vendors who have bundled our
    products with theirs may choose to bundle their software with
    their own or other vendors’ software or may limit our
    access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to
    develop products for their platform.

We face growing competition from network equipment, computer
    hardware manufacturers, large operating system providers and
    other technology companies. These firms are increasingly
    developing and incorporating into their products data protection
    and storage and server management software that competes at some
    levels with our product offerings. Our competitive position
    could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers
    perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as
    replacing the need for our products.

Security protection is also offered by some of our competitors
    at prices lower than our prices or, in some cases is bundled for
    free. Some companies offer the lower-priced or free security
    products within their computer hardware or software products
    that we believe are inferior to our products and SaaS offerings.
    Our competitive position could be adversely affected to the
    extent that our customers perceive these security products as
    replacing the need for more effective, full featured products
    and services such as those that we provide. The expansion of
    these competitive trends could have a significant negative
    impact on our sales and financial results.

Another growing industry trend is the SaaS business model, where
    software vendors develop and host their applications for use by
    customers over the Internet or through the “cloud.”
    This allows enterprises to obtain the benefits of commercially
    licensed, internally operated software without the associated
    complexity or high initial

set-up

and
    operational costs. Advances in the SaaS business model could
    enable the growth of our competitors and could affect the
    success of our traditional software licensing models. Our
    inability to successfully develop and market new and existing
    SaaS offerings could cause us to lose business to competitors.

Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical,
    sales, marketing, or other resources than we do and consequently
    may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their
    products instead of ours. Further consolidation within our
    industry or other changes in the competitive environment, such
    as Intel Corporation’s recently completed acquisition of
    MFE, could result in larger competitors that compete with us on
    several levels. We also face competition from many smaller
    companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets
    in which we compete.

Defects
    or disruptions in our SaaS offerings could reduce demand for our
    services and subject us to substantial liability.

Our SaaS offerings may contain errors or defects that users
    identify after they begin using them that could result in
    unanticipated service interruptions, which could harm our
    reputation and our business. Since our customers use our SaaS
    offerings for mission-critical protection from threats to
    electronic information, endpoint devices, and computer networks,
    any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance
    problems with our SaaS offerings could significantly harm our
    reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses. If
    that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, or delay or
    withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers
    may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result
    in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an
    increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the
    expense and risk of litigation.



If we
    fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively
    or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to
    their customers, our operating results could be adversely
    affected.

We sell our products to customers around the world through
    multi-tiered sales and distribution networks. Sales through
    these different channels involve distinct risks, including the
    following:

Direct Sales.

A significant portion of our
    revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our
    direct sales force to end-users. Special risks associated with
    direct sales include:

•

Longer sales cycles associated with direct sales efforts

•

Difficulty in hiring, retaining, and motivating our direct sales
    force

•

Substantial amounts of training for sales representatives to
    become productive, including regular updates to cover new and
    revised products

Indirect Sales Channels.

A significant portion
    of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels,
    including distributors that sell our products to end-users and
    other resellers. This channel involves a number of risks,
    including:

•

Our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products
    to end-users

•

Our resellers and distributors are generally not subject to
    minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our
    products to their customers

•

Our reseller and distributor agreements are generally
    nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause

•

Our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute
    competing products and may, from time to time, place greater
    emphasis on the sale of these products due to pricing,
    promotions, and other terms offered by our competitors

•

Recent consolidation of electronics retailers has increased
    their negotiating power with respect to hardware and software
    providers

OEM Sales Channels.

A significant portion of
    our revenues is derived from sales through our OEM partners that
    incorporate our products into, or bundle our products with,
    their products. Our reliance on this sales channel involves many
    risks, including:

•

Our lack of control over the volume of systems shipped and the
    timing of such shipments

•

Our OEM partners are generally not subject to minimum sales
    requirements or any obligation to market our products to their
    customers

•

Our OEM partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements
    with us and new terms may be less favorable due to competitive
    conditions in our markets and other factors

•

Sales through our OEM partners are subject to changes in general
    economic conditions, strategic direction, competitive risks, and
    other issues that could result in a reduction of OEM sales

•

The development work that we must generally undertake under our
    agreements with our OEM partners may require us to invest
    significant resources and incur significant costs with little or
    no assurance of ever receiving associated revenues

•

The time and expense required for the sales and marketing
    organizations of our OEM partners to become familiar with our
    products may make it more difficult to introduce those products
    to the market

•

Our OEM partners may develop, market, and distribute their own
    products and market and distribute products of our competitors,
    which could reduce our sales

If we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels
    successfully, these channels may conflict with one another or
    otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate, which could reduce
    our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our
    competitive position. Some of our distribution partners have
    experienced financial difficulties in the



past, and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the
    future because of general economic conditions or for other
    reasons, these partners may delay paying their obligations to us
    and we may have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that
    could adversely affect our operating results. In addition,
    reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could
    cause unpredictability in demand, which could increase the risk
    that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future, and
    could result in adverse operating results in future periods.

We
    have grown, and may continue to grow, through acquisitions,
    which gives rise to risks and challenges that could adversely
    affect our future financial results.

We have in the past acquired, and we expect to acquire in the
    future, other businesses, business units, and technologies.
    Acquisitions can involve a number of special risks and
    challenges, including:

•

Complexity, time, and costs associated with the integration of
    acquired business operations, workforce, products, and
    technologies

•

Diversion of management time and attention

•

Loss or termination of employees, including costs associated
    with the termination or replacement of those employees

•

Assumption of liabilities of the acquired business, including
    litigation related to the acquired business

•

The addition of acquisition-related debt as well as increased
    expenses and working capital requirements

•

Dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders

•

Substantial accounting charges for restructuring and related
    expenses, write-off of in-process research and development,
    impairment of goodwill, amortization of intangible assets, and
    stock-based compensation expense

If integration of our acquired businesses is not successful, we
    may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or
    suffer other adverse effects. To integrate acquired businesses,
    we must implement our technology systems in the acquired
    operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the
    acquired operations. We also must effectively integrate the
    different cultures of acquired business organizations into our
    own in a way that aligns various interests, and may need to
    enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and
    where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions.

Any of the foregoing, and other factors, could harm our ability
    to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired
    businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of
    acquisitions.

Risks
    related to the provision of our SaaS offerings could impair our
    ability to deliver our services and could expose us to
    liability.

We currently serve our SaaS-based customers from hosting
    facilities located across the globe. Any damage to, or failure
    of, any element of these hosting facilities could result in
    interruptions in our service, which could harm our customers and
    expose us to liability. Interruptions or failures in our service
    delivery could cause customers to terminate their subscriptions
    with us, could adversely affect our renewal rates, and could
    harm our ability to attract new customers. Our business would
    also be harmed if our customers believe that our SaaS offerings
    are unreliable. As we continue to offer more of our software
    products in a SaaS-based delivery model, all of these risks
    could be exacerbated.

Our SaaS offerings also involve the storage and transmission of
    customers’ proprietary information, and security breaches
    could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, which
    could lead to litigation and possible liability. Despite our
    precautions to protect against such breaches, our security
    measures could be breached at any time and could result in
    unauthorized third parties obtaining access to our, or our
    customers’ data. A security breach could also result in a
    loss of confidence in the security of our SaaS offerings, which
    could negatively impact our business.



Our
    financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
    affected if we do not effectively manage our
    liabilities.

As a result of the sale of our 0.75% convertible senior notes
    (“0.75% Notes”) and 1.00% convertible senior
    notes (“1.00% Notes”), collectively referred to
    as the Convertible Senior Notes in June 2006, and
    2.75% senior notes (“2.75% Notes”) and
    4.20% senior notes (“4.20% Notes”),
    collectively referred to as the Senior Notes in September 2010,
    we have notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of
    $2.7 billion that mature at specific dates in calendar
    years 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2020. In addition, we have entered
    into a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of
    $1 billion. From time to time in the future, we may also
    incur indebtedness in addition to the amount available under our
    credit facility. Our maintenance of substantial levels of debt
    could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage of
    certain corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our
    financial condition and results of operations. Of our
    outstanding Convertible Senior Notes, $600 million matures
    and is repayable in June 2011 and $1.0 billion is due in
    June 2013. We may be required to use all or a substantial
    portion of our cash balance to repay these notes on maturity
    unless we can obtain new financing.

Adverse
    global economic events may harm our business, operating results
    and financial condition.

Adverse macroeconomic conditions could negatively affect our
    business, operating results or financial condition under a
    number of different scenarios. During challenging economic times
    and periods of high unemployment, current or potential customers
    may delay or forgo decisions to license new products or
    additional instances of existing products, upgrade their
    existing hardware or operating environments (which upgrades are
    often a catalyst for new purchases of our software), or purchase
    services. Customers may also have difficulties in obtaining the
    requisite third-party financing to complete the purchase of our
    products and services. An adverse macroeconomic environment
    could also subject us to increased credit risk should customers
    be unable to pay us, or delay paying us, for previously
    purchased products and services. Accordingly, reserves for
    doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may
    increase. In addition, weakness in the market for end users of
    our products could harm the cash flow of our distributors and
    resellers who could then delay paying their obligations to us or
    experience other financial difficulties. This would further
    increase our credit risk exposure and, potentially, cause delays
    in our recognition of revenue on sales to these customers.

In addition, the onset or continuation of adverse economic
    conditions may make it more difficult either to utilize our
    existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our
    operations, investing activities (including potential
    acquisitions) or financing activities. Specific economic trends,
    such as declines in the demand for PCs, servers, and other
    computing devices, or softness in corporate information
    technology spending, could have an even more direct, and
    harmful, impact on our business.

Our
    international operations involve risks that could increase our
    expenses, adversely affect our operating results, and require
    increased time and attention of our management.

We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers
    located outside of the U.S. and we have significant
    operations outside of the U.S., including engineering, sales,
    customer support, and production. We plan to expand our
    international operations, but such expansion is contingent upon
    the financial performance of our existing international
    operations as well as our identification of growth
    opportunities. Our international operations are subject to risks
    in addition to those faced by our domestic operations, including:

•

Potential loss of proprietary information due to
    misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our
    intellectual property rights than U.S. laws or that may not
    be adequately enforced

•

Requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls,
    including trade and labor restrictions and related laws that
    reduce the flexibility of our business operations

•

Regulations or restrictions on the use, import, or export of
    encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the
    acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks
    for secure communications

•

Local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal
    standards and practices, including business practices that we
    are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices
    Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations



•

Central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate
    cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in
    international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the
    U.S.

•

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability
    such as higher interest rates in the U.S. and inflationary
    conditions that could reduce our customers’ ability to
    obtain financing for software products or that could make our
    products more expensive or could increase our costs of doing
    business in certain countries

•

Limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current
    levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest
    sufficiently in our international operations

•

Longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and
    difficulties in collecting accounts receivable

•

Difficulties in staffing, managing, and operating our
    international operations, including difficulties related to
    administering our stock plans in some foreign countries

•

Difficulties in coordinating the activities of our
    geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations

•

Seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in
    Europe and in other periods in other countries

•

Costs and delays associated with developing software and
    providing support in multiple languages

•

Political unrest, war, or terrorism, or regional natural
    disasters, particularly in areas in which we have facilities

A significant portion of our transactions outside of the
    U.S. are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly,
    our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to
    fluctuations in foreign currency rates. We expect to be affected
    by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future,
    especially if international sales continue to grow as a
    percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the
    United States continue to increase.

The level of corporate tax from sales to our

non-U.S. customers

is generally less than the level of tax from sales to our
    U.S. customers. This benefit is contingent upon existing
    tax regulations in the U.S. and in the countries in which
    our international operations are located. Future changes in
    domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect
    our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits.

Our
    products are complex and operate in a wide variety of computer
    configurations, which could result in errors or product
    failures.

Because we offer very complex products, undetected errors,
    failures, or bugs may occur, especially when products are first
    introduced or when new versions are released. Our products are
    often installed and used in large-scale computing environments
    with different operating systems, system management software,
    and equipment and networking configurations, which may cause
    errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected
    errors, failures, or bugs in our products. Our customers’
    computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety
    of standard and non-standard configurations that make
    pre-release testing for programming or compatibility errors very
    difficult and time-consuming. In addition, despite testing by us
    and others, errors, failures, or bugs may not be found in new
    products or releases until after commencement of commercial
    shipments. In the past, we have discovered software errors,
    failures, and bugs in certain of our product offerings after
    their introduction and, in some cases, have experienced delayed
    or lost revenues as a result of these errors.

Errors, failures, or bugs in products released by us could
    result in negative publicity, damage to our brand, product
    returns, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products,
    loss of competitive position, or claims by customers or others.
    Many of our end-user customers use our products in applications
    that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater
    sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other,
    less critical, software products. In addition, if an actual or
    perceived breach of information integrity or availability occurs
    in one of our end-user customer’s systems, regardless of
    whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market
    perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed.
    Alleviating any of these problems could require significant
    expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause
    interruptions, delays, or cessation of our



product licensing, which could cause us to lose existing or
    potential customers and could adversely affect our operating
    results.

If we
    are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, lose key
    personnel, fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully,
    or fail to manage our employee base effectively, we may be
    unable to develop new and enhanced products and services,
    effectively manage or expand our business, or increase our
    revenues.

Our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and
    retain our key management, technical, sales, marketing, finance,
    and other critical personnel. Our officers and other key
    personnel are

employees-at-will,

and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them.
    Competition for people with the specific skills that we require
    is significant. In order to attract and retain personnel in a
    competitive marketplace, we believe that we must provide a
    competitive compensation package, including cash and
    equity-based compensation. The volatility in our stock price may
    from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or
    retain employees. In addition, we may be unable to obtain
    required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number
    of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation
    plans, and accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of
    employee stock options and other forms of equity-based
    compensation as compensation expense. As a result, we may decide
    to issue fewer equity-based incentives and may be impaired in
    our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. If we are
    unable to hire and retain qualified employees, or conversely, if
    we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels
    when required by market conditions, our business and operating
    results could be adversely affected.

From time to time, key personnel leave our company. While we
    strive to reduce the negative impact of such changes, the loss
    of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to
    our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of
    product releases, the successful implementation and completion
    of company initiatives, the effectiveness of our disclosure
    controls and procedures and our internal control over financial
    reporting, and the results of our operations. In addition,
    hiring, training, and successfully integrating replacement sales
    and other personnel could be time consuming, may cause
    additional disruptions to our operations, and may be
    unsuccessful, which could negatively impact future revenues.

From
    time to time we are a party to class action lawsuits, which
    often require significant management time and attention and
    result in significant legal expenses, and which could, if not
    determined favorably, negatively impact our business, financial
    condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

We have been named as a party to class action lawsuits, and we
    may be named in additional litigation. The expense of defending
    such litigation may be costly and divert management’s
    attention from the

day-to-day

operations of our business, which could adversely affect our
    business, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, an
    unfavorable outcome in such litigation could negatively impact
    our business, results of operations, and cash flows.

Third
    parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could
    cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from
    selling our products.

From time to time, we receive claims that we have infringed the
    intellectual property rights of others, including claims
    regarding patents, copyrights, and trademarks. In addition,
    former employers of our former, current, or future employees may
    assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to
    us the confidential or proprietary information of these former
    employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result
    in costly litigation and distract management from

day-to-day

operations. If we are not successful in defending such claims,
    we could be required to stop selling, delay shipments of, or
    redesign our products, pay monetary amounts as damages, enter
    into royalty or licensing arrangements, or satisfy
    indemnification obligations that we have with some of our
    customers. We cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing
    arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be
    available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

In addition, we license and use software from third parties in
    our business. These third party software licenses may not
    continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all,
    and may expose us to additional liability. This



liability, or our inability to use any of this third party
    software, could result in shipment delays or other disruptions
    in our business that could materially and adversely affect our
    operating results.

If we
    do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third
    parties from making unauthorized use of our products and
    technology, our financial results could be harmed.

Most of our software and underlying technology is proprietary.
    We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination
    of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through
    copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws. However,
    all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be
    challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. Third
    parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise
    obtain, use, distribute, and sell our proprietary information
    without authorization. Third parties may also develop similar or
    superior technology independently by designing around our
    patents. Our shrink-wrap license agreements are not signed by
    licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of
    some jurisdictions. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign
    countries do not offer the same level of protection of our
    proprietary rights as the laws of the U.S., and we may be
    subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries.
    The unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary
    information could result in reduced sales of our products. Any
    legal action to protect proprietary information that we may
    bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could
    adversely affect our ability to access software, operating
    system, and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor, or
    cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products
    to their customers. In addition, any legal action to protect
    proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in,
    alone or through our alliances with the Business Software
    Alliance (“BSA”), or the Software &
    Information Industry Association (“SIIA”), could be
    costly, may distract management from

day-to-day

operations, and may lead to additional claims against us, which
    could adversely affect our operating results.

Some
    of our products contain “open source” software, and
    any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these
    open source licenses could negatively affect our
    business.

Certain of our products are distributed with software licensed
    by its authors or other third parties under so-called “open
    source” licenses, which may include, by way of example, the
    GNU General Public License (“GPL”), GNU Lesser General
    Public License (“LGPL”), the Mozilla Public License,
    the BSD License, and the Apache License. Some of these licenses
    contain requirements that we make available source code for
    modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open
    source software, and that we license such modifications or
    derivative works under the terms of a particular open source
    license or other license granting third parties certain rights
    of further use. By the terms of certain open source licenses, we
    could be required to release the source code of our proprietary
    software if we combine our proprietary software with open source
    software in a certain manner. In addition to risks related to
    license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to
    greater risks than use of third party commercial software, as
    open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or
    controls on origin of the software. We have established
    processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review
    process for screening requests from our development
    organizations for the use of open source, but we cannot be sure
    that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in
    our products. In addition, many of the risks associated with
    usage of open source cannot be eliminated, and could, if not
    properly addressed, negatively affect our business.

Our
    software products and website may be subject to intentional
    disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future
    sales.

Although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to
    prevent intentional disruptions, we expect to be an ongoing
    target of attacks specifically designed to impede the
    performance of our products and harm our reputation as a
    company. Similarly, experienced computer programmers may attempt
    to penetrate our network security or the security of our website
    and misappropriate proprietary information

and/or

cause
    interruptions of our services. Because the techniques used by
    such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change
    frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a
    target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. The
    theft

and/or

unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other
    confidential business information as a result of such an event
    could adversely affect our competitive position, reputation,
    brand and future sales of our products, and our customers may
    assert claims against us related to resulting losses of
    confidential or proprietary information. Our



business could be subject to significant disruption, and we
    could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm, in
    the event of such incidents and claims.

Increased
    customer demands on our technical support services may adversely
    affect our relationships with our customers and our financial
    results.

We offer technical support services with many of our products.
    We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate
    short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We
    also may be unable to modify the format of our support services
    to compete with changes in support services provided by
    competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers.
    Further customer demand for these services, without
    corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely
    affect our operating results.

We have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide
    consumer support functions to third party service providers. If
    these companies experience financial difficulties, do not
    maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy
    our contracts, or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient
    level under these contracts, the level of support services to
    our customers may be significantly disrupted, which could
    materially harm our relationships with these customers.

Accounting
    charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial
    results.

Our financial results have been in the past, and may continue to
    be in the future, materially affected by non-cash and other
    accounting charges, including:

•

Amortization of intangible assets, including acquired product
    rights

•

Impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets

•

Stock-based compensation expense

•

Restructuring charges

•

Loss on sale of a business and similar write-downs of assets
    held for sale

For example, during fiscal 2009, we recorded a non-cash goodwill
    impairment charge of $7.4 billion, resulting in a
    significant net loss for the year. Goodwill is evaluated
    annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal
    year or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant as
    we determined they did in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, and
    our evaluation depends to a large degree on estimates and
    assumptions made by our management. Our assessment of any
    impairment of goodwill is based on a comparison of the fair
    value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of
    that reporting unit. Our determination of fair value relies on
    management’s assumptions of our future revenues, operating
    costs, and other relevant factors. If management’s
    estimates of future operating results change, or if there are
    changes to other key assumptions such as the discount rate
    applied to future operating results, the estimate of the fair
    value of our reporting units could change significantly, which
    could result in a goodwill impairment charge. In addition, we
    evaluate our other long-lived assets, including intangible
    assets whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate
    that the value of these assets might be impaired. If we
    determine that impairment has occurred, we could incur an
    impairment charge against the value of these assets.

The foregoing types of accounting charges may also be incurred
    in connection with or as a result of other business
    acquisitions. The price of our common stock could decline to the
    extent that our financial results are materially affected by the
    foregoing accounting charges.

Our
    effective tax rate may increase, which could increase our income
    tax expense and reduce (increase) our net income
    (loss).

Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several
    factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:

•

Changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income
    before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate
    that have differing statutory tax rates



•

Changing tax laws, regulations, and interpretations in multiple
    jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the requirements of
    certain tax rulings

•

The tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and
    restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between
    reporting periods

•

Tax assessments, or any related tax interest or penalties, could
    significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in
    which the settlements take place

The price of our common stock could decline if our financial
    results are materially affected by an adverse change in our
    effective tax rate.

We report our results of operations based on our determination
    of the aggregate amount of taxes owed in the tax jurisdictions
    in which we operate. From time to time, we receive notices that
    a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction has determined that
    we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such
    authority. We are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes
    disputes with these tax authorities. We are engaged in disputes
    of this nature at this time. If the ultimate determination of
    our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in
    excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for,
    our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could
    be adversely affected.

Fluctuations
    in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of
    our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in
    the future.

Our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and
    are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number
    of factors, many of which are outside of our control and which
    could adversely affect our operations and operating results. If
    our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future
    financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities
    analysts and investors, our stock price could be negatively
    affected. Any volatility in our quarterly financial results may
    make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or
    pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock. Our
    operating results for prior periods may not be effective
    predictors of our future performance.

Factors associated with our industry, the operation of our
    business, and the markets for our products may cause our
    quarterly financial results to fluctuate, including:

•

Reduced demand for any of our products

•

Entry of new competition into our markets

•

Competitive pricing pressure for one or more of our classes of
    products

•

Our ability to timely complete the release of new or enhanced
    versions of our products

•

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

•

The number, severity, and timing of threat outbreaks (e.g. worms
    and viruses)

•

Our resellers making a substantial portion of their purchases
    near the end of each quarter

•

Enterprise customers’ tendency to negotiate site licenses
    near the end of each quarter

•

Cancellation, deferral, or limitation of orders by customers

•

Movement in interest rates

•

The rate of adoption of new product technologies and new
    releases of operating systems

•

Weakness or uncertainty in general economic or industry
    conditions in any of the multiple markets in which we operate
    that could reduce customer demand and ability to pay for our
    products and services

•

Political and military instability, which could slow spending
    within our target markets, delay sales cycles, and otherwise
    adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and operate
    effectively



•

Budgetary constraints of customers, which are influenced by
    corporate earnings and government budget cycles and spending
    objectives

•

Disruptions in our business operations or target markets caused
    by, among other things, earthquakes, floods, or other natural
    disasters affecting our headquarters located in Silicon Valley,
    California, an area known for seismic activity, or our other
    locations worldwide

•

Acts of war or terrorism

•

Intentional disruptions by third parties

•

Health or similar issues, such as a pandemic

Any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of
    our common stock to fluctuate significantly.

Our
    stock price may be volatile in the future, and you could lose
    the value of your investment.

The market price of our common stock has experienced significant
    fluctuations in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the
    future, and as a result you could lose the value of your
    investment. The market price of our common stock may be affected
    by a number of factors, including:

•

Announcements of quarterly operating results and revenue and
    earnings forecasts by us that fail to meet or be consistent with
    our earlier projections or the expectations of our investors or
    securities analysts

•

Announcements by either our competitors or customers that fail
    to meet or be consistent with their earlier projections or the
    expectations of our investors or securities analysts

•

Rumors, announcements, or press articles regarding our
    competitors’ operations, management, organization,
    financial condition, or financial statements

•

Changes in revenue and earnings estimates by us, our investors,
    or securities analysts

•

Accounting charges, including charges relating to the impairment
    of goodwill

•

Announcements of planned acquisitions or dispositions by us or
    by our competitors

•

Announcements of new or planned products by us, our competitors,
    or our customers

•

Gain or loss of a significant customer

•

Inquiries by the SEC, NASDAQ, law enforcement, or other
    regulatory bodies

•

Acts of terrorism, the threat of war, and other crises or
    emergency situations

•

Economic slowdowns or the perception of an oncoming economic
    slowdown in any of the major markets in which we operate

The stock market in general, and the market prices of stocks of
    technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme
    price volatility that has adversely affected, and may continue
    to adversely affect, the market price of our common stock for
    reasons unrelated to our business or operating results.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

OVERVIEW

Our
    Business

Symantec is a global provider of security, storage and systems
    management solutions that help businesses and consumers secure
    and manage their information and identities.

Fiscal
    Calendar

We have a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to
    March 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to fiscal
    years in this report relate to fiscal year and periods ended
    April 1, 2011, April 2, 2010 and April 3, 2009.
    Fiscal 2011 and 2010 each consisted of 52 weeks, while
    fiscal 2009 consisted of 53 weeks. Our 2012 fiscal year
    will consist of 52 weeks and will end on March 30,
    2012.

Our
    Operating Segments

Our operating segments are significant strategic business units
    that offer different products and services, distinguished by
    customer needs. Since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we have
    operated in five operating segments: Consumer, Security and
    Compliance, Storage and Server Management, Services, and Other.
    For further descriptions of our operating segments, see
    Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    in this annual report. Our reportable segments are the same as
    our operating segments.

Financial
    Results and Trends

Revenue increased by $205 million for fiscal 2011 compared
    to fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011, we experienced growth in our
    Security and Compliance segment primarily as a result of revenue
    associated with our fiscal 2011 acquisitions. During fiscal
    2011, we acquired the identity and authentication business of
    VeriSign, Inc (“VeriSign”), PGP Corporation
    (“PGP”), and GuardianEdge Technologies, Inc.
    (“GuardianEdge”) for an aggregate amount of
    approximately $1.5 billion, net of cash acquired. We expect
    that these acquisitions will continue to contribute positively
    to our revenue in future periods in the Security and Compliance
    segment. Within our Storage and Server Management segment, sales
    of our information management products experienced growth while
    we experienced weakness in our storage management solutions.
    Consumer segment revenues for fiscal 2011 benefited from the
    completion of our transition to an internally-developed
    eCommerce platform for our Norton-branded consumer products
    worldwide, excluding Japan, during the first quarter of fiscal
    2011. The fees we had previously paid to Digital River for
    operating our online store for these products were recorded as
    an offset to revenue; however, we



incur expenses resulting from our eCommerce platform, components
    of which are recorded as a cost of revenue and an operating
    expense.

Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar compared to foreign
    currencies unfavorably impacted our international revenue by
    approximately $53 million for fiscal 2011 as compared to
    fiscal 2010 and favorably impacted our international revenue by
    approximately $14 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to
    fiscal 2009. We are unable to predict the extent to which
    revenue in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates. If our level of international sales and
    expenses increase in the future, changes in foreign exchange
    rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenue and
    operating results.

Our net income attributable to Symantec Corporation stockholders
    was $597 million for fiscal 2011 and $714 million for
    2010. Our net income for fiscal 2011 was negatively impacted by
    a loss of $21 million from the liquidation of certain
    foreign entities and $27 million from the impairment of
    intangible assets, while net income for fiscal 2010 was
    positively affected by a gain of $47 million from the
    liquidation of certain foreign entities. Our fiscal 2011 and
    fiscal 2010 net income were positively impacted relative to
    the preceding year by a decrease of $119 million and
    $128 million, respectively, in cost of revenue primarily
    related to certain acquired product rights becoming fully
    amortized. Net income for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was also
    positively impacted by tax benefits resulting from the reversal
    of accrued liabilities and correlative benefits related to the
    Veritas Software tax assessment for 2000 and 2001 of
    $49 million and $79 million, respectively.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and
    related notes included in this annual report in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States,
    requires us to make estimates, which include judgments and
    assumptions, that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and related disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates
    on historical experience and on various assumptions that we
    believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate
    our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly.
    Historically, our critical accounting estimates have not
    differed materially from actual results; however, actual results
    may differ from these estimates under different conditions. If
    actual results differ from these estimates and other
    considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual
    report, the resulting changes could have a material adverse
    effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and in
    certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on
    liquidity and our financial condition.

A critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and
    assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the
    estimate is made. Different estimates that reasonably could have
    been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially
    impact the operating results or financial condition. We believe
    that the estimates described below represent our critical
    accounting estimates, as they have the greatest potential impact
    on our consolidated financial statements. See also Note 1
    of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
    in this annual report.

Revenue
    Recognition

We recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements
    under the authoritative guidance on software revenue
    recognition, and any applicable amendments or modifications.
    Revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are
    very complex and require us to make many estimates.

For software arrangements that include multiple elements,
    including perpetual software licenses and maintenance

and/or

services, packaged products with content updates, managed
    security services, and subscriptions, we allocate and defer
    revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific
    objective evidence (“VSOE”) of the fair value of the
    undelivered elements, and recognize the difference between the
    total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the
    undelivered items as revenue. VSOE of each element is based on
    the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately.
    We determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on
    historical evidence of our stand-alone sales of these elements
    to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the
    undelivered elements. When VSOE does not exist for undelivered
    items, the entire arrangement fee is recognized



ratably over the performance period. Our deferred revenue
    consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise
    product maintenance, consumer product content updates, managed
    security services, subscriptions, and arrangements where VSOE
    does not exist. Deferred revenue totaled approximately
    $3.8 billion as of April 1, 2011, of which
    $498 million was classified as Long-term deferred revenue
    in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes to the elements in a
    software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those
    elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and
    increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could
    materially impact the amount recognized in the current period
    and deferred over time.

For arrangements that include both software and non-software
    elements, we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a
    group and non-software deliverables based on their relative
    selling prices. In such circumstances, the accounting principles
    establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used
    for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows:
    (i) VSOE, (ii) third-party evidence of selling price
    (“TPE”) and (iii) best estimate of the selling
    price (“ESP”). When we are unable to establish a
    selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use ESP to allocate the
    arrangement fees to the deliverables.

For our consumer products that include content updates, we
    recognize revenue and the associated cost of revenue ratably
    over the term of the subscription upon sell-through to
    end-users, as the subscription period commences on the date of
    sale to the end-user. We defer revenue and cost of revenue
    amounts for unsold product held by our distributors and
    resellers.

We expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate
    inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer
    demand, which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand
    based on recent buying trends. We ship product to our
    distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid
    purchase orders. Our distributors and resellers base the
    quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer
    demand, which may exceed the expected level of a four or six
    week supply. We offer limited rights of return if the inventory
    held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected
    level of a four or six week supply. We estimate reserves for
    product returns as described below. We typically offer liberal
    rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and
    resellers exceeds the expected level. Because we cannot
    reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be
    returned, we primarily offset deferred revenue against trade
    accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the
    expected inventory levels.

Arrangements for managed security services and SaaS offerings
    are generally offered to our customers over a specified period
    of time, and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the
    maintenance, subscription, or service period.

Reserves for product returns.

We reserve for
    estimated product returns as an offset to revenue based
    primarily on historical trends. We fully reserve for obsolete
    products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred
    revenue. Actual product returns may be different than what was
    estimated. These factors and unanticipated changes in the
    economic and industry environment could make actual results
    differ from our return estimates.

Reserves for rebates.

We estimate and record
    reserves for channel and end-user rebates as an offset to
    revenue. For consumer products that include content updates,
    rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the
    term of the subscription. Our estimated reserves for channel
    volume incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and
    resellers’ actual performance against the terms and
    conditions of volume incentive rebate programs, which are
    typically entered into quarterly. Our reserves for end-user
    rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the
    promotional programs, actual sales during the promotion, the
    amount of actual redemptions received, historical redemption
    trends by product and by type of promotional program, and the
    value of the rebate. We also consider current market conditions
    and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates. If
    actual redemptions differ from our estimates, material
    differences may result in the amount and timing of our net
    revenues for any period presented.

Valuation
    of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived
    assets

Business Combination Valuations.

When we
    acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to tangible
    assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets
    acquired. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill.
    The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make
    significant estimates in determining the fair



values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially
    with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based on
    information obtained from management of the acquired companies
    and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are
    not limited to:

•

cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future;

•

expected costs to develop the in-process research and
    development into commercially viable products and estimated cash
    flows from the projects when completed;

•

the acquired company’s brand and competitive position, as
    well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand
    will continue to be used in the combined company’s product
    portfolio;

•

cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an
    asset; and

•

discount rates.

These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and
    if different estimates were used the purchase price for the
    acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and
    liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made.
    In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur
    which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and
    if such events occur we may be required to record a charge
    against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase
    in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities.

Goodwill Impairment.

We review goodwill for
    impairment on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth
    quarter of each fiscal year, and on an interim basis whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value may not be recoverable, at the reporting unit level. Our
    reporting units are the same as our operating segments. Before
    performing the goodwill impairment test, we first assess the
    value of long-lived assets in each reporting unit, including
    tangible and intangible assets. We then perform a two-step
    impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the
    estimated fair value of equity of each reporting unit to its
    allocated carrying value (book value) of equity. If the carrying
    value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the equity
    associated with that unit, there is an indicator of impairment
    and we must perform the second step of the impairment test. This
    second step involves determining the implied fair value of that
    reporting unit’s goodwill in a manner similar to the
    purchase price allocation for an acquired business, using the
    reporting unit’s calculated fair value as an assumed
    purchase price. If the carrying value of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we
    would record an impairment loss equal to the excess.

The process of estimating the fair value and carrying value of
    our reporting units’ equity requires significant judgment
    at many points during the analysis. Many assets and liabilities,
    such as accounts receivable and property and equipment, are not
    specifically allocated to an individual reporting unit, and
    therefore, we apply judgment to allocate the assets and
    liabilities, and this allocation affects the carrying value of
    the respective reporting units. Similarly, we use judgment to
    allocate goodwill to the reporting units based on relative fair
    values. The use of relative fair values has been necessary for
    certain reporting units due to changes in our operating
    structure in prior years. To determine a reporting unit’s
    fair value, we use the income approach under which we calculate
    the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated
    discounted future cash flows of that unit. We evaluate the
    reasonableness of this approach by comparing it with the market
    approach, which involves a review of the carrying value of our
    assets relative to our market capitalization and to the
    valuation of publicly traded companies operating in the same or
    similar lines of business.

Applying the income approach requires that we make a number of
    important estimates and assumptions. We estimate the future cash
    flows of each reporting unit based on historical and forecasted
    revenue and operating costs. This, in turn, involves further
    estimates, such as estimates of future revenue and expense
    growth rates and foreign exchange rates. In addition, we apply a
    discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose
    of the valuation. This discount rate is based on the estimated
    weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit and may
    change from year to year. For example, in our valuation process
    in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we used a lower discount
    rate than in the prior year due to stabilized risk associated
    with the global economic conditions. Changes in these key
    estimates and assumptions, or in other assumptions used in this
    process, could materially affect our impairment analysis for a
    given year.



As of April 1, 2011, our goodwill balance was
    $5 billion. Based on the impairment analysis performed on
    January 4, 2011, we determined that the fair value of each
    of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the unit
    by more than 10% of the carrying value. While discount rates are
    only one of several important estimates used in the analysis, we
    determined that an increase of one percentage point in the
    discount rate used for each respective reporting unit would not
    have resulted in an impairment indicator for any unit at the
    time of this analysis, except for the Security and Compliance
    reporting unit which would have had a fair value 5% below
    carrying value. However, we believe that the discount rate
    applied to the Security and Compliance reporting unit is
    appropriate and we applied the same discount rate for this
    reporting unit in fiscal 2011 as we used in fiscal 2010. In
    addition to the discount rate, the impairment test includes the
    consideration of a number of estimates, including growth rates,
    operating margins and cost forecasts, foreign exchange rates and
    the allocation of certain tangible assets to the reporting
    units. Based on the results of our impairment test, we do not
    believe that an impairment indicator exists as of our annual
    impairment test date.

A number of factors, many of which we have no ability to
    control, could affect our financial condition, operating results
    and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ
    from the estimates and assumptions we employed. These factors
    include:

•

a prolonged global economic crisis;

•

a significant decrease in the demand for our products;

•

the inability to develop new and enhanced products and services
    in a timely manner;

•

a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business
    climate;

•

an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;

•

successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in
    our markets;

•

a loss of key personnel;

•

our determination to dispose of one or more of our reporting
    units;

•

the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group
    within a reporting unit; and

•

recognition of a goodwill impairment loss.

Intangible Asset Impairment.

We assess the
    impairment of identifiable finite-lived intangible assets
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an
    asset group’s carrying amount may not be recoverable.
    Recoverability of certain finite-lived intangible assets,
    particularly customer relationships and finite-lived tradenames,
    would be measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of
    the asset group to which the assets are assigned to the sum of
    the undiscounted estimated future cash flows the asset group is
    expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired,
    the amount of such impairment would be measured as the
    difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair
    value. Recoverability and impairment of other finite-lived
    intangible assets, particularly developed technology and
    patents, would be measured by the comparison of the carrying
    amount of the asset to the sum of undiscounted estimated future
    product revenues offset by estimated future costs to dispose of
    the product to which the asset relates. For indefinite-lived
    intangible assets, we review impairment on an annual basis
    consistent with the timing of the annual evaluation for
    goodwill. These assets generally include tradenames, trademarks
    and in-process research and development. Recoverability of
    indefinite-lived intangible assets would be measured by the
    comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the
    discounted estimated future cash flows the asset is expected to
    generate plus expected royalties. If the asset is considered to
    be impaired, the amount of such impairment would be measured as
    the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its
    fair value. Our cash flow assumptions are based on historical
    and forecasted future revenue, operating costs, and other
    relevant factors. Assumptions and estimates about the remaining
    useful lives of our intangible assets are subjective and are
    affected by changes to our business strategies. If
    management’s estimates of future operating results change,
    or if there are changes to other assumptions, the estimate of
    the fair value of our identifiable intangible assets could
    change significantly. Such change could result in impairment
    charges in future periods, which could have a significant impact
    on our operating results and financial condition.



Long-Lived Assets (including Assets Held for
    Sale).

We assess long-lived assets to be held and
    used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value of the long-lived assets may
    not be recoverable. Based on the existence of one or more
    indicators of impairment, we assess recoverability of long-lived
    assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using
    assumptions determined by management to be commensurate with the
    risk inherent in our current business model. If an asset is not
    recoverable, impairment is measured as the difference between
    the carrying amount and its fair value. Our estimates of cash
    flows require significant judgment based on our historical and
    anticipated results and are subject to many factors which could
    change and cause a material impact to our operating results or
    financial condition. We record impairment charges on long-lived
    assets held for sale when we determine that the carrying value
    of the long-lived assets may not be recoverable. In determining
    fair value, we obtain and consider market value appraisal
    information from third-parties.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The assessment of fair value for our financial instruments is
    based on the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements
    which establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on three
    levels of inputs and requires an entity to maximize the use of
    observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
    when measuring fair value.

We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields,
    broker/dealer quotes and other similar data which are obtained
    from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices or other
    sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and
    liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input, to
    which we have not made any material adjustments, to make our
    assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of
    our investment portfolio, and we are ultimately responsible for
    the financial statements and underlying estimates. The fair
    value and inputs are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further
    validated by comparison to publicly available information and
    could be adjusted based on market indices or other information
    that we deem material to the estimated fair value of our
    investment portfolio.

As of April 1, 2011, our financial instruments measured at
    fair value on a recurring basis included $2.0 billion of
    assets which consists of cash equivalents invested in money
    market funds and bank securities. Investments totalling
    $1.9 billion were classified as Level 1 and
    $204 million were classified as Level 2, which are
    comprised solely of money market funds and bank securities,
    respectively.

Valuations for Level 1 securities were based on quoted
    prices for identical securities in active markets. Determining
    fair value for Level 1 instruments generally does not
    require significant management judgment. Valuations for
    Level 2 securities were based on either (1) the fair
    value of similar securities or (2) pricing models with all
    significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable
    market prices for identical securities in markets with
    insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active
    markets).

While determining the fair value for Level 2 instruments
    does not necessarily require significant management judgment, it
    generally involves the following degree of judgment and
    subjectivity: (1) an assessment of an active market for
    marketable securities generally takes into consideration whether
    a trading market exists for a given instrument or the level of
    trading volume for each instrument type and (2) when
    observable market prices for identical securities or similar
    securities are not available, we may price marketable securities
    using: non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated
    with observable market data; or pricing models, such as
    discounted cash flow approaches, with all significant inputs
    derived from or corroborated with observable market data. The
    majority of our Level 2 financial instruments were
    classified as such due to either low trading activity in active
    markets or no active market existing. For certain financial
    instruments, identical securities were used to determine fair
    value. For those securities where no active market existed,
    amortized cost was used as it approximates their fair value
    because of their short maturities.

As of April 1, 2011, we had no financial instruments with
    unobservable inputs classified in Level 3 under the
    hierarchy set forth under the authoritative guidance on fair
    value measurements. Level 3 instruments generally would
    include those for which unobservable inputs used in the
    valuation methodology are significant to the measurement of fair
    value of assets or liabilities. The determination of fair value
    for Level 3 instruments requires the most management
    judgment and subjectivity.



Stock-based
    Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the
    authoritative guidance on stock compensation. Under the fair
    value recognition provisions of this guidance, stock-based
    compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair
    value of the award and is recognized as expense over the
    requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period
    of the respective award.

Determining the fair value of stock-based awards, primarily
    stock options, at the grant date requires judgment. We use the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value
    of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value
    of options using an option-pricing model is affected by our
    stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex
    and subjective variables. These variables include our expected
    stock price volatility over the expected life of the options,
    actual and projected employee stock option exercise and
    cancellation behaviors, risk-free interest rates, and expected
    dividends.

We estimate the expected life of options granted based on an
    analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and
    post-vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the
    contractual life of the option. Expected volatility is based on
    the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate
    with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility
    of traded options. The risk free interest rate is equal to the
    U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal
    to the expected life. We do not currently pay cash dividends on
    our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the
    foreseeable future. Accordingly, our expected dividend yield is
    zero.

In accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock
    compensation, we only record stock-based compensation expense
    for awards that are expected to vest. As a result, judgment is
    also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards
    that are expected to be forfeited. Although we estimate
    forfeitures based on historical experience, actual forfeitures
    may differ. If actual results differ significantly from these
    estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of
    operations could be materially impacted when we record an
    adjustment for the difference in the period that the awards vest
    or are forfeited.

Contingencies
    and Litigation

We evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or
    pending litigation in accordance with the authoritative guidance
    on contingencies. We assess the likelihood of any adverse
    judgments or outcomes from a potential claim or legal
    proceeding, as well as potential ranges of probable losses, when
    the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and
    reasonably estimable. A determination of the amount of accrued
    liabilities required, if any, for these contingencies is made
    after the analysis of each separate matter. Because of
    uncertainties related to these matters, we base our estimates on
    the information available at the time of our assessment. As
    additional information becomes available, we reassess the
    potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation
    and may revise our estimates. Any revisions in the estimates of
    potential liabilities could have a material impact on our
    operating results and financial position.

Income
    Taxes

We are required to compute our income taxes in each federal,
    state, and international jurisdiction in which we operate. This
    process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as
    well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and
    tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as
    accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax
    purposes. The income tax effects of the differences we identify
    are classified as current or long-term deferred tax assets and
    liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our judgments,
    assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for
    income tax take into account current tax laws, our
    interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of
    current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax
    authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax
    laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could
    significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

We account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to authoritative
    guidance based on a two-step approach to recognize and measure
    uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax
    return. The first step is to determine if the weight of
    available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not
    that the tax position will be



sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals
    or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax
    benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be
    realized upon ultimate settlement. We adjust reserves for our
    uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances,
    such as the closing of a tax audit, refinement of estimates, or
    realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our
    estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters
    is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will
    impact our tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of
    Operations in the period in which such determination is made.

We must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will
    be realized from future taxable income and, based on this
    assessment establish a valuation allowance, if required. Our
    determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number
    of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including forecasted
    earnings, future taxable income, and the relative proportions of
    revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and
    international jurisdictions in which we operate. To the extent
    we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation
    allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a
    corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In July 2008, we reached an agreement with the IRS concerning
    our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made
    from a Veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the July 2005
    acquisition. The distribution was intended to be made pursuant
    to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and therefore
    eligible for a 5.25% effective U.S. federal rate of tax, in
    lieu of the 35% statutory rate. The final impact of this
    agreement remains uncertain since this relates to the taxability
    of earnings that are otherwise the subject of the transfer
    pricing matters at issue in the IRS examination of Veritas tax
    years 2002 through 2005. To the extent that we owe taxes as a
    result of these transfer pricing matters in years prior to the
    distribution, we anticipate that the incremental tax due from
    this negotiated agreement will decrease. We currently estimate
    that the most probable outcome from this negotiated agreement
    will be that we will owe $13 million or less, for which an
    accrual has already been made.

    sales of our premium security suite. Our electronic channel
    sales are derived from online sales (which include new
    subscriptions, renewals, and upgrades), OEMs, and ISPs. For
    fiscal 2011, electronic channel revenue increased as compared to
    fiscal 2010.

Operating income for the Consumer segment increased for fiscal
    2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to increased revenue,
    partially offset by costs associated with the deployment of our
    new proprietary eCommerce platform.

Consumer revenue increased for fiscal 2010, as compared to
    fiscal 2009, primarily due to increases in revenue from acquired
    security products and our core consumer products in the
    electronic channel.

Operating income for the Consumer segment decreased for fiscal
    2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as expense growth outpaced
    revenue growth. Total expenses for the segment increased
    primarily as a result of the higher OEM placement fees and costs
    associated with our development and operation of our new

Security and Compliance revenue increased for fiscal 2011, as
    compared to fiscal 2010, due to increases in revenue from our
    2011 acquisitions.

Security and Compliance operating income decreased for fiscal
    2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to increased expenses
    related to our fiscal 2011 acquisitions and higher sales
    commissions associated with the increase in deferred revenue in
    2011. Our operating margins were adversely impacted by our
    fiscal 2011 acquisitions, largely because we were required under
    the purchase accounting rules to reduce the amount of deferred
    revenue that we recorded in connection with these acquisitions
    to an amount equal to the fair value of our estimated cost to
    fulfill the contractual obligations related to that deferred
    revenue. This deferred revenue adjustment negatively affected
    our operating margins because we recognized a lower portion of
    the revenue from these acquisitions (representing our estimated
    cost to fulfill the contractual obligations plus a normal
    margin), but we incurred all of the revenue-related expenses.

Security and Compliance revenue decreased for fiscal 2010, as
    compared to fiscal 2009, as a result of decreased demand due to
    reduced corporate IT budgets and slowed spending, partially
    offset by increases in revenue from acquired security products.

Operating income for the segment decreased for fiscal 2010, as
    compared to fiscal 2009, as revenue decreased while expenses
    increased as a result of our fiscal 2009 acquisitions, partially
    offset by our cost containment measures.

Storage and Server Management operating income decreased for
    fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, due to the reasons
    discussed above under “Financial Results and Trends.”

Storage and Server Management revenue decreased for fiscal 2010,
    as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to the overall market
    weakness in server sales and our customers buying smaller
    volumes of new licenses consistent with their near term needs,
    particularly with respect to our storage management products.

Operating income for the Storage and Server Management segment
    increased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as the
    decrease in expenses more than offset the decrease in revenue

Our international sales are and will continue to be a
    significant portion of our net revenue. As a result, net revenue
    will continue to be affected by foreign currency exchange rates
    as compared to the U.S. dollar. We are unable to predict
    the extent to which revenue in future periods will be impacted
    by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If international
    sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future,
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a
    potentially greater impact on our revenue and operating results.

Acquired product rights are comprised of developed technologies
    and patents from acquired companies. The decrease in
    amortization for fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010, was
    primarily due to certain acquired product rights related to our
    acquisition of Veritas becoming fully amortized during the first
    quarters of fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2011. This decrease was
    partially offset by additional amortization from product rights
    acquired from VeriSign, PGP, and GuardianEdge during fiscal 2011.

    during the first quarter of our fiscal 2010. This decrease was
    partially offset by additional amortization from product rights
    acquired from SwapDrive, PC Tools, and MessageLabs during fiscal
    2009.

Sales and marketing expense increased for fiscal 2011, as
    compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to our fiscal 2011
    acquisitions, higher sales commissions associated with increased
    deferred revenue in fiscal 2011, and increased costs associated
    with the deployment of our new proprietary eCommerce platform.



Sales and marketing expense remained relatively flat during
    fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 sales and
    marketing expense reflects the impact of our prior year
    restructuring plan, partially offset by increases in headcount
    related expenses from our fiscal 2009 acquisitions and increases
    in Consumer OEM placement fees and costs associated with the
    development and operations of our new proprietary eCommerce
    platform.

Research and development expense remained relatively flat as a
    percentage of revenue in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009.

General and administrative expense increased for fiscal 2011, as
    compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to our fiscal 2011
    acquisitions. As a percentage of revenue, general and
    administrative expense remained flat in fiscal 2011, 2010, and

Other purchased intangible assets are comprised of customer

    other purchased intangible assets for fiscal 2011, as compared
    to fiscal 2010, was primarily due to our acquisition of
    VeriSign’s identity and authentication business. As a
    percentage of net revenue, amortization of other purchased
    intangible assets remained relatively consistent for fiscal
    2011, as compared to fiscal 2010.

Amortization for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009,
    increased as a result of our fiscal 2009 acquisitions. As a
    percentage of net revenue, amortization of other purchased
    intangible assets remained relatively consistent for fiscal 2010

    Restructuring Plan (“2010 Plan”), and transition costs
    related to certain back office functions.

Total remaining costs are estimated to range from
    $10 million to $18 million, primarily for the 2011

During fiscal 2011, we recorded an impairment of
    $27 million which reduced the gross carrying value of
    indefinite-lived tradenames. This impairment charge was due to
    reductions in expected future cash flows for certain
    indefinite-lived tradenames related to the Consumer segment.
    This impairment charge was recorded within Impairment of
    intangible assets and goodwill on the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

During fiscal 2010 and 2009, we recognized impairments of
    $20 million and $46 million, respectively, on certain
    land and buildings classified as held for sale. The impairments
    were recorded in accordance with the authoritative guidance that
    requires a long-lived asset classified as held for sale to be
    measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value, less
    cost to sell. Also, in fiscal 2010, we sold assets for
    $42 million which resulted in losses of $10 million.
    We sold properties in fiscal 2009 for $40 million with an
    immaterial loss.

During fiscal 2009, we concluded that there were impairment
    indicators, including the challenging economic environment and a
    decline in our market capitalization, which required us to
    perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis. As a result, we
    incurred a total impairment charge of $7.4 billion for
    fiscal 2009.

The increase in interest expense during fiscal 2011, as compared
    to fiscal 2010, is due to the Senior Notes issued in the second
    quarter of fiscal 2011. Other (expense) income, net for fiscal
    2011 includes a $21 million loss from the liquidation of
    certain foreign legal entities, partially offset by a realized
    gain on marketable securities. Other (expense) income, net for
    fiscal 2010 included net gains of $47 million from the
    liquidation of certain foreign legal entities. The Loss on early
    extinguishment of debt of $16 million was due to the
    repurchase of $500 million of aggregate principal amount of
    the 0.75% Notes due on June 15, 2011. See Note 6
    of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The decrease in interest income during fiscal 2010, as compared
    to fiscal 2009, was due to a lower average yield on our invested
    cash and short-term investment balances. Interest expense for
    fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, remained relatively
    consistent. Other (expense) income, net for fiscal 2010 included
    net gains of $47 million from the liquidation of certain
    foreign legal entities. The liquidations resulted in the release
    of cumulative translation adjustments from accumulated other
    comprehensive income related to these entities.

Effective tax rate on earnings


%


%

(3

)%

Our effective tax rate was approximately 14%, 13%, and (3)% in
    fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, and 2009, respectively.

The tax expense in fiscal 2011 was reduced by the following
    benefits: (1) $49 million arising from the Veritas v
    Commissioner Tax Court decision further discussed below,
    (2) $15 million from the reduction of our valuation
    allowance for certain deferred tax assets, and
    (3) $21 million tax benefit from lapses of statutes of
    limitation, and (4) $7 million tax benefit from the
    conclusion of U.S. and foreign audits.

The tax expense in fiscal 2010 was significantly reduced by the
    following benefits: (1) $79 million tax benefit
    arising from the

Veritas v. Commissioner

Tax Court
    decision, (2) $11 million tax benefit from the
    reduction of our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax
    assets, (3) $17 million tax benefit from lapses of
    statutes of limitation, (4) $9 million tax benefit
    from the conclusion of U.S. and foreign audits,
    (5) $7 million tax benefit to adjust taxes provided in
    prior periods, and (6) $6 million tax benefit from
    current year discrete events. The change in the valuation
    allowance follows discussions with Irish Revenue in the third
    quarter of fiscal 2010, the result of which accelerates the
    timing of the use of certain Irish tax loss carryforwards in the
    future. The tax expense in fiscal 2009 was materially impacted
    by the inclusion of a $56 million tax benefit associated
    with the $7.0 billion impairment of goodwill in the third
    quarter of fiscal 2009.

The effective tax rates for all periods presented otherwise
    reflects the benefits of lower-taxed foreign earnings and losses
    from our joint venture with Huawei Technologies Co., Limited,
    domestic manufacturing incentives, and research and development
    credits, partially offset by state income taxes. Substantially
    all of the foreign earnings were generated by subsidiaries in
    Ireland and Singapore.

As a result of the impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2009, we
    have cumulative pre-tax book losses, as measured by the current
    and prior two years. We considered the negative evidence of this
    cumulative pre-tax book loss position on our ability to continue
    to recognize deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future
    taxable income for realization. Levels of future taxable income
    are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in
    Part I, Item 1A,

Risk Factors,

set forth in
    this annual report. We considered the following as positive
    evidences: the vast majority of the goodwill impairment is not
    deductible for tax purposes and thus will not result in tax
    losses; we have a strong, consistent taxpaying history; we have
    substantial U.S. federal income tax carryback potential;
    and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of
    taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities.
    We have concluded that these positive evidences outweigh the
    negative evidence and, thus, that the deferred tax assets as of
    April 1, 2011of $536 million, after application of the
    valuation allowances, are realizable on a “more likely than
    not” basis.

On March 29, 2006, we received a Notice of Deficiency from
    the IRS claiming that we owe $867 million of additional
    taxes, excluding interest and penalties, for the 2000 and 2001
    tax years based on an audit of Veritas. On June 26, 2006,
    we filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court, Veritas v
    Commissioner, protesting the IRS claim for such additional
    taxes. During July 2008, we completed the trial phase of the Tax
    Court case, which dealt with the remaining issue covered in the
    assessment. At trial, the IRS changed its position with respect
    to this remaining issue, which decreased the remaining amount at
    issue from $832 million to $545 million, excluding
    interest.

On December 10, 2009, the U.S. Tax Court issued its
    opinion, finding that our transfer pricing methodology, with
    appropriate adjustments, was the best method for assessing the
    value of the transaction at issue between Veritas and its
    offshore subsidiary. The Tax Court judge provided guidance as to
    how adjustments would be made to correct the application of the
    method used by Veritas. We remeasured and decreased our
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits accordingly, resulting
    in a $79 million tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal
    2010. In June 2010, we reached an agreement with the IRS
    concerning the amount of the adjustment related to the
    U.S. Tax Court decision. As a result of the agreement, we
    further reduced our liability for unrecognized tax benefits,
    resulting in an additional



$39 million tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal
    2011. In March 2011, we reached agreement with Irish Revenue
    concerning compensating adjustments arising from this matter,
    resulting in an additional $10 million tax benefit in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. This matter has now been closed
    and no further adjustments to the accrued liability are
    warranted.

On December 2, 2009, we received a Revenue Agent’s
    Report from the IRS for the Veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years
    assessing additional taxes due. We agree with $30 million
    of the tax assessment, excluding interest, but will contest the
    other $80 million of tax assessed and all penalties. The
    unagreed issues concern transfer pricing matters comparable to
    the one that was resolved in our favor in the

Veritas v.
    Commissioner

Tax Court decision. On January 15, 2010 we
    filed a protest with the IRS in connection with the
    $80 million of tax assessed. On September 28, 2010,
    the case was formally accepted into the IRS Appeals process for
    consideration. This matter remains outstanding.

We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing tax controversies
    and the impact, if any, of the expected tolling of the statute
    of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.

On February 5, 2008, Symantec formed Huawei-Symantec,
    Technologies Co., Limited (“joint venture”) with a
    subsidiary of Huawei Technologies Co., Limited
    (“Huawei”). The joint venture is domiciled in Hong
    Kong with principal operations in Chengdu, China. The joint
    venture develops, manufactures, markets and supports security
    and storage appliances for global telecommunications carriers
    and enterprise customers.

For fiscal 2011, we recorded a loss of approximately
    $31 million related to our share of the joint
    venture’s net loss incurred for the period from
    January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010. For fiscal 2010,
    we recorded a loss of approximately $39 million related to
    our share of the joint venture’s net loss incurred for the
    period from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009. For
    fiscal 2009, we recorded a loss of approximately
    $53 million related to our share of the joint
    venture’s net loss incurred for the period from
    February 5, 2008 (its date of inception) to
    December 31, 2008.

Loss
    attributable to noncontrolling interest

In fiscal 2011, we completed the acquisition of the identity and
    authentication business of VeriSign, Inc.
    (“VeriSign”), including a controlling interest in its
    subsidiary VeriSign Japan K.K. (“VeriSign Japan”), a
    publicly traded company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Given the
    Company’s majority ownership interest of approximately 54%
    in VeriSign Japan, the accounts of VeriSign Japan have been
    consolidated with the accounts of the Company, and a
    noncontrolling interest has been recorded for the noncontrolling
    investors’ interests in the equity and operations of
    VeriSign Japan. For fiscal 2011, the loss attributable to the
    noncontrolling interest in VeriSign Japan was $4 million.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Sources
    of Cash

We have historically relied on cash flow from operations,
    borrowings under a credit facility, and issuances of debt and
    equity securities for our liquidity needs. As of April 1,
    2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3 billion
    resulting in a net liquidity position of approximately
    $4 billion, which is defined as cash and cash equivalents
    and unused availability of the credit facility.



Senior Notes.

In the second quarter of fiscal
    2011, we issued $350 million in principal amount of
    2.75% Notes due September 15, 2015 and
    $750 million in principal amount of 4.20% Notes due
    September 15, 2020, for an aggregate principal amount of
    $1.1 billion.

Revolving Credit Facility.

In the second
    quarter of fiscal 2011, we also entered into a $1 billion
    senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in
    September 2014. Under the terms of this credit facility, we must
    comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants,
    including a covenant to maintain a specified ratio of debt to
    EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
    amortization). As of April 1, 2011, we were in compliance
    with all required covenants, and there was no outstanding
    balance on the credit facility.

In addition, in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we terminated
    our previous $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit
    facility that we entered into in July 2006. At the time of
    termination, there was no outstanding balance on the credit
    facility. The original expiration date for this credit facility
    was July 2011.

We believe that our existing cash and investment balances, our
    borrowing capacity, our ability to issue new debt instruments,
    and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet
    our working capital and capital expenditures requirements for at
    least the next 12 months.

Uses of
    Cash

Our principal cash requirements include working capital, capital
    expenditures and payments of principal and interest on our debt
    and taxes. In addition, we regularly evaluate our ability to
    repurchase stock and acquire other businesses.

Acquisition-related.

In fiscal 2011, we
    acquired the identity and authentication business of VeriSign,
    as well as PGP, GuardianEdge and two other companies for an
    aggregate amount of $1.5 billion, net of cash acquired. In
    fiscal 2010, we acquired two companies for an aggregate payment
    of $31 million, net of cash acquired. For fiscal 2009, we
    acquired MessageLabs, PC Tools, SwapDrive, and several other
    companies for an aggregate payment of $1.1 billion, net of
    cash acquired.

Convertible Senior Notes.

In June 2006, we
    issued $1.1 billion principal amount of 0.75% Notes
    due June 15, 2011, and $1.0 billion principal amount
    of 1.00% Notes due June 15, 2013, to initial
    purchasers in a private offering for resale to qualified
    institutional buyers pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. In fiscal
    2011, we repurchased $500 million of aggregate principal
    amount of our 0.75% Notes in privately negotiated
    transactions for approximately $510 million. Concurrently
    with the repurchase, we sold a proportionate share of the note
    hedges that we entered into at the time of the issuance of the
    Convertible Senior Notes back to the note hedge counterparties
    for approximately $13 million. The net cost of the
    repurchase of the 0.75% Notes and the concurrent sale of
    the note hedges was $497 million in cash. We did not pay
    any amount of the 0.75% Notes or the 1.00% Notes other
    than the related interest costs in either of fiscal 2010 or 2009.

Stock Repurchases.

We repurchased
    57 million, 34 million, and 42 million shares for
    $872 million, $553 million, and $700 million
    during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. As of
    April 1, 2011, we had $877 million remaining under the
    plan authorized for future repurchases.

Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion
    for fiscal 2011, which resulted from net income of
    $593 million adjusted for non-cash items, including
    depreciation and amortization charges of $743 million and
    stock-based compensation expense of $145 million, and an
    increase in deferred revenue of $442 million. These amounts
    were partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable of
    $128 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion
    for fiscal 2010, which resulted from net income of
    $714 million adjusted for non-cash items, including
    depreciation and amortization charges of $837 million and
    stock-based compensation expense of $155 million. These
    amounts were partially offset by a decrease in income taxes
    payable of $95 million primarily related to the outcome of
    the

Veritas v. Commissioner

Tax Court decision; see
    Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion
    for fiscal 2009, which resulted from non-cash charges related to
    depreciation and amortization expenses of $933 million and
    the $7.4 billion goodwill impairment charge offset by the
    net loss of $6.8 billion.

Investing
    Activities

Net cash used in investing activities of $1.8 billion for
    fiscal 2011 was due to $1.5 billion of payments for our
    fiscal 2011 acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and
    $268 million paid for capital expenditures.

Net cash used in investing activities was $65 million for
    fiscal 2010 and was primarily due to $248 million paid for
    capital expenditures, partially offset by net proceeds from the
    sale of

available-for-sale

securities of $190 million.

Net cash used in investing activities was $1.0 billion for
    fiscal 2009 and was primarily due to an aggregate payment of
    $1.1 billion in cash for acquisitions, net of cash
    acquired, and $272 million paid for capital expenditures,
    partially offset by net proceeds of $336 million from the
    sale of short-term investments which were used to partially fund
    acquisitions.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash used in financing activities of $184 million for
    fiscal 2011 was primarily due to repurchases of common stock of
    $872 million and repurchases of long-term debt of
    $510 million, partially offset by proceeds from debt
    issuance, net of discount, of $1.1 billion and net proceeds
    from sales of common stock through employee stock plans of
    $122 million.

Net cash used in financing activities of $441 million for
    fiscal 2010 was due to repurchases of common stock of
    $553 million, partially offset by net proceeds from sales
    of common stock through employee stock plans of
    $124 million.

Net cash used in financing activities was $677 million for
    fiscal 2009 and was primarily due to repurchases of common stock
    of $700 million and the repayment of $200 million on
    our revolving credit facility, partially offset by net proceeds
    from sales of common stock through employee stock plans of
    $229 million.

As of April 1, 2011, $1.6 billion of the
    $3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable
    securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We have
    provided U.S. deferred taxes on a portion of our
    undistributed foreign earnings sufficient to address the
    incremental U.S. tax that would be due if we needed these
    funds for our operations in the U.S.

Indemnifications

As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we
    indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or
    occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at
    our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of
    future payments we could be required to make under these
    indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have
    directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage that
    reduces our exposure



and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts
    paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these
    indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance
    coverage is minimal.

We provide limited product warranties and the majority of our
    software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify
    licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from
    claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual
    property rights of a third party. Historically, payments made
    under these provisions have been immaterial. We monitor the
    conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a
    loss has occurred.

Recently
    Issued and Adopted Authoritative Guidance

In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we adopted new
    authoritative guidance which changes the model for determining
    whether an entity should consolidate a variable interest entity
    (“VIE”). The standard replaces the quantitative-based
    risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise
    has a controlling financial interest in a VIE with an approach
    focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct
    the activities of a VIE and the obligation to absorb losses of
    the entity or the right to receive the entity’s residual
    returns. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on
    our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2011.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, updated authoritative
    guidance was issued to modify Step 1 of the goodwill impairment
    test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
    For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step
    2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not
    that a goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is
    more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, we will
    need to consider whether there are any adverse qualitative
    factors indicating that an impairment may exist. The adoption of
    this guidance will be effective beginning April 2, 2011,
    the first quarter of our fiscal 2012. The updated guidance may
    require us to perform the Step 2 for our Services reporting unit
    upon adoption. The adoption of this guidance could potentially
    result in an impairment of the goodwill recorded in the Services
    reporting unit of up to $19 million.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations
    in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity
    prices. We may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate
    certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign
    exchange policies. We do not use derivatives or other financial
    instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our
    short-term investment portfolio and the potential losses arising
    from changes in interest rates. Our investment objective is to
    achieve the maximum return compatible with capital preservation
    and our liquidity requirements. Our strategy is to invest our
    cash in a manner that preserves capital, maintains sufficient
    liquidity to meet our cash requirements, maximizes yields
    consistent with approved credit risk, and limits inappropriate
    concentrations of investment by sector, credit, or issuer. We
    classify our cash equivalents and short-term investments in
    accordance with the authoritative guidance on investments. We
    consider investments in instruments purchased with an original
    maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. We
    classify our short-term investments as

available-for-sale.

Short-term investments consist of marketable debt or equity
    securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days.
    Our cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolios
    consist primarily of money market funds, commercial paper,
    corporate debt securities, and U.S. government and
    government-sponsored debt securities. Our short-term investments
    do not include equity investments in privately held companies.
    Our short-term investments are reported at fair value with
    unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in Accumulated
    other comprehensive income within Stockholders’ equity in
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of premiums
    and discounts on the investments, realized gains and losses, and
    declines in value judged to be

other-than-temporary

on

available-for-sale

securities are included in Other income, net in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. We use the specific identification
    method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and
    losses upon the sale of short-term investments.



The following table presents the fair value and hypothetical
    changes in fair values on short-term investments sensitive to
    changes in interest rates:

Amount not applicable

The modeling technique used above measures the change in fair
    market value arising from selected potential changes in interest
    rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel
    shifts in the yield curve of plus 150 bps, plus
    100 bps, plus 50 bps, and minus 25 bps.

As of April 1, 2011, we had $1.1 billion in principal
    amount of fixed-rate Senior Notes outstanding, with a carrying
    amount of $1.1 billion and a fair value of
    $1.05 billion, which fair value is based on market prices.
    As of April 1, 2011, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or
    decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of
    the fixed-rate debt by a decrease of approximately
    $34 million and an increase of approximately
    $35 million, respectively. However, this hypothetical
    change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense
    on the fixed-rate debt.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We conduct business in 43 currencies through our worldwide
    operations and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency
    risk. Foreign currency risks are associated with our cash and
    cash equivalents, investments, receivables, and payables
    denominated in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in exchange
    rates will result in foreign exchange gains and losses on these
    foreign currency assets and liabilities and are included in
    Other income, net. Our objective in managing foreign exchange
    activity is to preserve stockholder value by minimizing the risk
    of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Our strategy is to
    primarily utilize forward contracts to hedge foreign currency
    exposures. Under our program, gains and losses in our foreign
    currency exposures are offset by losses and gains on our forward
    contracts. Our forward contracts generally have terms of one to
    six months. At the end of the reporting period, open contracts
    are

marked-to-market

with unrealized gains and losses included in Other income, net.

The following table presents a sensitivity analysis on our
    foreign forward exchange contract portfolio using a statistical
    model to estimate the potential gain or loss in fair value that
    could arise from hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of
    foreign currency:

Equity
    Price Risk

In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion in principal amount of
    0.75% Notes and $1.0 billion in principal amount of
    1.00% Notes. We received proceeds of $2.1 billion from
    the 0.75% Notes and 1.00% Notes and incurred net
    transaction costs of approximately $33 million, of which
    $9 million was allocated to equity and the remainder



allocated proportionately to the 0.75% Notes and
    1.00% Notes. The 0.75% Notes and 1.00% Notes were
    each issued at par and bear interest at 0.75% and 1.00% per
    annum, respectively. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears
    on June 15 and December 15. Concurrent with the issuance of
    the 0.75% Notes and 1.00% Notes, the Company entered
    into note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain initial
    purchasers whereby the Company has the option to purchase up to
    110 million shares of Symantec common stock at a price of
    $19.12 per share. The cost of the note hedge transactions was
    approximately $592 million.

In September 2010, we repurchased $500 million aggregate
    principal amount of our 0.75% Notes. Concurrently with this
    repurchase, we sold a proportionate share of the initial note
    hedges back to the note hedge counterparties for approximately
    $13 million. These transactions resulted in a loss from
    extinguishment of debt of approximately $16 million, which
    represents the difference between book value of the notes net of
    the remaining unamortized discount prior to repurchase and the
    fair value of the liability component of the notes upon
    repurchase. The net cost of the repurchase of the
    0.75% Notes and the concurrent sale of the note hedges was
    $497 million in cash.

The Convertible Senior Notes have a fixed annual interest rate
    and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on
    the Convertible Senior Notes. However, the values of the
    Convertible Senior Notes are exposed to interest rate risk.
    Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate
    Convertible Senior Notes will increase as interest rates fall
    and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair
    values of our Convertible Senior Notes are affected by our stock
    price. The carrying value of the 0.75% Notes was
    $596 million as of April 1, 2011. This represents the
    liability component of the $600 million principal balance
    as of April 1, 2011. The total estimated fair value of our
    0.75% Notes at April 1, 2011 was $618 million and
    the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price
    per $100 of the 0.75% Notes as of the last day of trading
    for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, which was $103.00. The
    carrying value of the 1.00% Notes was $890 million as
    of April 1, 2011. This represents the liability component
    of the $1.0 billion principal balance as of April 1,
    2011. The total estimated fair value of our 1.00% Notes at
    April 1, 2011 was $1.2 billion and the fair value was
    determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the
    1.00% Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2011, which was $120.81.

For business and strategic purposes, we also hold equity
    interests in several privately held companies, many of which can
    be considered to be in the

start-up

or
    development stages. These investments are inherently risky and
    we could lose a substantial part or our entire investment in
    these companies. These investments are recorded at cost and
    classified as Other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. As of April 1, 2011, these investments had an
    aggregate carrying value of $30 million.

The amounts previously reported on

for fiscal 2010 have been adjusted for the joint venture’s
    adoption of authoritative guidance on revenue recognition. As a
    result of our joint venture’s adoption of the guidance, our
    net income increased by $1 million, $5 million and
    $1 million during our first, second and third quarters of
    fiscal 2010, respectively.

On August 9, 2010, we completed the acquisition of the
    identity and authentication business of VeriSign, Inc.
    (“VeriSign”), including a controlling interest in its
    subsidiary VeriSign Japan K.K. (“VeriSign Japan”), a
    publicly traded company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Given the
    Company’s majority ownership interest in VeriSign Japan,
    the accounts of VeriSign Japan have been consolidated with the
    accounts of the Company, and a noncontrolling interest has been
    recorded for the noncontrolling investors’ interests in the
    equity and operations of VeriSign Japan. For more information,
    see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in this annual report.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The SEC defines the term “disclosure controls and
    procedures” to mean a company’s controls and other
    procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
    to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under
    the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and
    reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms. “Disclosure controls and procedures”
    include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in
    the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management,
    including its principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded, based



on an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
    and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Exchange Act) by our management, with the participation of
    our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
    that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
    the end of the period covered by this report.

(b)

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Exchange Act) for Symantec. Our management, with the
    participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
    Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of April 1, 2011, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”). We have excluded from our evaluation, the
    internal control over financial reporting of the identity and
    authentication business acquired from VeriSign, Inc. and
    subsidiaries (“VeriSign”), which we acquired on
    August 9, 2010, as discussed in Note 3 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report. As of
    April 1, 2011, total net tangible assets subject to
    VeriSign’s internal control over financial reporting
    represented $178 million or 1% of our total assets. Total
    revenue subject to VeriSign’s internal control over
    financial reporting represented $137 million of net
    revenue, or less than 2% of net revenue for the fiscal year
    ended April 1, 2011. As noted below, our internal control
    over financial reporting, subsequent to the date of acquisition,
    includes certain additional internal controls relating to the
    identity and authentication business of VeriSign, in addition to
    VeriSign’s internal control over financial reporting.

Our management has concluded that, as of April 1, 2011, our
    internal control over financial reporting was effective based on
    these criteria.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
    has issued an attestation report regarding its assessment of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    April 1, 2011, which is included in Part IV,
    Item 15 of this annual report.

(c)

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

As a result of our acquisition of the identity and
    authentication business of VeriSign on August 9, 2010, our
    internal control over financial reporting, subsequent to the
    date of acquisition, includes certain additional internal
    controls relating to such acquisition. Except as described
    above, there were no changes in our internal control over
    financial reporting during the quarter ended April 1, 2011
    which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(d)

Limitations
    on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors
    and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
    and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute,
    assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
    Furthermore, the design of a control system must reflect the
    fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
    controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of
    the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
    of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
    issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have
    been detected.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Symantec Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries as of April 1, 2011
    and April 2, 2010, and the related consolidated statements
    of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for
    each of the years in the three-year period ended April 1,
    2011. In connection with our audits of the consolidated
    financial statements, we have also audited the related financial
    statement schedule listed in Item 15. These consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    April 1, 2011 and April 2, 2010, and the results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended April 1, 2011, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in
    our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Symantec Corporation’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of April 1, 2011, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
    dated May 20, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Symantec Corporation:

We have audited Symantec Corporation’s (the
    “Company”) internal control over financial reporting
    as of April 1, 2011, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). Symantec Corporation’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A(b). Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Symantec Corporation maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of April 1, 2011, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

Management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of April 1, 2011, the internal control over financial
    reporting of the identity and authentication business of
    VeriSign, Inc. and subsidiaries (“VeriSign”), which
    was acquired on August 9, 2010 as discussed in Note 3
    of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Total net
    tangible assets subject to VeriSign’s internal control over
    financial reporting represented $178 million, and total
    revenue subject to VeriSign’s internal control over
    financial reporting represented $137 million of net
    revenue. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
    of Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries also excluded an
    evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of
    VeriSign.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Symantec Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of April 1, 2011 and April 2, 2010,
    and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended April 1, 2011, and our
    report dated May 20, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion
    on those consolidated financial statements.

SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Symantec Corporation (“we,” “us,”
    “our,” and “the Company” refer to Symantec
    Corporation and all of its subsidiaries) is a provider of
    security, storage and systems management solutions that help
    businesses and consumers secure and manage their information and
    identities. We provide customers worldwide with software and
    services that protect, manage and control information risks
    related to security, data protection, storage, compliance, and
    systems management. We help our customers manage cost,
    complexity and compliance by protecting their IT infrastructure
    as they seek to maximize value from their IT investments.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Symantec
    Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are prepared in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
    United States (“U.S.”). All significant intercompany
    accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior
    year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
    presentation with no impact on previously reported net income.

In fiscal 2011, we completed the acquisition of the identity and
    authentication business of VeriSign, Inc.
    (“VeriSign”), including a controlling interest in its
    subsidiary VeriSign Japan K.K. (“VeriSign Japan”), a
    publicly traded company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Given the
    Company’s majority ownership interest of approximately 54%
    in VeriSign Japan, the accounts of VeriSign Japan have been
    consolidated with the accounts of the Company, and a
    noncontrolling interest has been recorded for the noncontrolling
    investors’ interests in the equity and operations of
    VeriSign Japan. See Note 3 for further detail.

Fiscal
    Calendar

We have a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to
    March 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in
    this report relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years.

April 2, 2010



April 3, 2009


Our 2012 fiscal year will consist of 52 weeks and will end
    on March 30, 2012.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
    U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based upon
    historical factors, current circumstances and the experience and
    judgment of management. Management evaluates its assumptions and
    estimates on an ongoing basis and may engage outside subject
    matter experts to assist in its valuations. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such
    estimates and assumptions include those related to the
    allocation of revenue between recognized and deferred amounts,
    fair value of financial instruments, valuation of goodwill,
    intangible assets and long-lived assets, valuation of
    stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation, and the
    valuation allowance for deferred income taxes.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally
    the local currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in
    foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate on the
    balance sheet dates. Revenues and expenses are translated using
    monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the year. The
    translation



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

adjustments resulting from this process are included as a
    component of Accumulated other comprehensive income. In the
    event of liquidation of a foreign subsidiary, the accumulated
    translation adjustment attributable to that foreign subsidiary
    is reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income and
    included in Other Income, net. As a result of such liquidations
    in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a net loss of
    $21 million, a net gain of $47 million, and a net loss
    of $5 million, respectively. Foreign currency transaction
    gains and losses are also included in Other income, net, in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations. We had foreign currency
    transaction losses of $7 million and $3 million for
    fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. We had a foreign currency
    transaction gain in fiscal 2009 of $11 million. Deferred
    tax assets (liabilities) are established on the cumulative
    translation adjustment attributable to unremitted foreign
    earnings that are not intended to be indefinitely reinvested.

Revenue
    Recognition

We market and distribute our software products both as
    stand-alone products and as integrated product suites. We
    recognize revenue when 1) persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists, 2) delivery has occurred or services
    have been rendered, 3) fees are fixed or determinable and
    4) collectability is probable. If we determine that any one
    of the four criteria is not met, we will defer recognition of
    revenue until all the criteria are met.

We derive revenue primarily from sales of content,
    subscriptions, and maintenance and licenses. We present revenue
    net of sales taxes and any similar assessments.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue includes
    arrangements for software maintenance and technical support for
    our products, content and subscription services primarily
    related to our security products, revenue from arrangements
    where vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of
    the fair value of undelivered elements does not exist,
    arrangements for managed security services, and
    Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) offerings. These
    arrangements are generally offered to our customers over a
    specified period of time, and we recognize the related revenue
    ratably over the maintenance, subscription, or service period.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue also includes
    professional services revenue, which consists primarily of the
    fees we earn related to consulting and educational services. We
    generally recognize revenue from professional services as the
    services are performed or upon written acceptance from
    customers, if applicable, assuming all other conditions for
    revenue recognition noted above have been met.

License revenue is derived primarily from the licensing of our
    various products and technology. We generally recognize license
    revenue upon delivery of the product, assuming all other
    conditions for revenue recognition noted above have been met.

We enter into perpetual software license agreements through
    direct sales to customers and indirect sales with distributors
    and resellers. The license agreements generally include product
    maintenance agreements, for which the related revenue is
    included with Content, subscriptions, and maintenance and is
    deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the
    agreements.

For arrangements that include multiple elements, including
    perpetual software licenses, maintenance, services, and packaged
    products with content updates, managed security services, and
    subscriptions, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered
    items based on VSOE of the fair value of the undelivered
    elements, and recognize the difference between the total
    arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered
    items as license revenue. VSOE of each element is based on
    historical evidence of our stand-alone sales of these elements
    to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the
    undelivered elements. When VSOE does not exist for undelivered
    items, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the
    performance period. Our deferred revenue consists primarily of
    the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance,
    consumer product content updates, managed security services,
    subscriptions, and arrangements where VSOE does not exist for an
    undelivered element.

For arrangements that include both software and non-software
    elements, we allocate revenue to the software deliverables as a
    group and non-software deliverables based on their relative
    selling prices. In such circumstances,



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the
    selling price used for allocating revenue to the deliverables as
    follows: (i) VSOE, (ii) third-party evidence of
    selling price (“TPE”) and (iii) the best estimate
    of the selling price (“ESP”). Our appliance products,
    SaaS and certain other services are considered to be
    non-software elements in our arrangements.

When we are unable to establish a selling price using VSOE or
    TPE, we use ESP in the allocation of arrangement consideration.
    The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would
    transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a
    stand-alone basis. The determination of ESP is made through
    consultation with and formal approval by our management, taking
    into consideration the

go-to-market

strategy and pricing factors. ESP applies to a small portion of
    our arrangements with multiple deliverables.

Indirect
    channel sales

For our Consumer segment, we sell packaged software products
    through a multi-tiered distribution channel. We also sell
    electronic download and packaged products via the Internet. We
    separately sell annual content update subscriptions directly to
    end-users primarily via the Internet. For our consumer products
    that include content updates, we recognize revenue ratably over
    the term of the subscription upon sell-through to end-users, as
    the subscription period commences on the date of sale to the
    end-user. For most other consumer products, we recognize
    packaged product revenue on distributor and reseller channel
    inventory that is not in excess of specified inventory levels in
    these channels. We offer the right of return of our products
    under various policies and programs with our distributors,
    resellers, and end-user customers. We estimate and record
    reserves for product returns as an offset to revenue. We fully
    reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channel as an
    offset to deferred revenue for products with content updates and
    to revenue for all other products.

For our Security and Compliance and Storage and Server
    Management segments, we generally recognize revenue from the
    licensing of software products through our indirect sales
    channel upon sell-through or with evidence of an end-user. For
    licensing of our software to OEMs, royalty revenue is recognized
    when the OEM reports the sale of the software products to an
    end-user, generally on a quarterly basis. In addition to license
    royalties, some OEMs pay an annual flat fee

and/or

support royalties for the right to sell maintenance and
    technical support to the end-user. We recognize revenue from OEM
    support royalties and fees ratably over the term of the support
    agreement.

We offer channel and end-user rebates for our products. Our
    estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are
    based on distributors’ and resellers’ actual
    performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive
    rebate programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our
    reserves for end-user rebates are estimated based on the terms
    and conditions of the promotional program, actual sales during
    the promotion, the amount of actual redemptions received,
    historical redemption trends by product and by type of
    promotional program, and the value of the rebate. We estimate
    and record reserves for channel and end-user rebates as an
    offset to revenue. For consumer products that include content
    updates, rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue
    over the term of the subscription.

Financial
    Instruments

The following methods were used to estimate the fair value of
    each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable
    to estimate that value:

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

We consider all
    highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
    months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are
    recognized at fair value. As of April 1, 2011, our cash
    equivalents consisted of $1.9 billion in money market funds
    and $204 million in bank securities and deposits. As of
    April 2, 2010, our cash equivalents consisted of
    $2.0 billion in money market funds, $216 million in
    bank securities and deposits, and $116 million in
    government securities.



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Short-Term Investments.

Short-term investments
    consist of marketable debt or equity securities that are
    classified as

available-for-sale

and recognized at fair value. The determination of fair value is
    further detailed in Note 2. Our portfolios generally
    consist of (1) debt securities which include asset-backed
    securities, corporate securities and government securities, and
    (2) marketable equity securities. As of April 1, 2011,
    our asset-backed securities have contractual maturity dates in
    excess of 10 years. We regularly review our investment
    portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have
    indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in
    determining whether a loss is

other-than-temporary

include: the length of time and extent to which the fair market
    value has been lower than the cost basis, the financial
    condition and near-term prospects of the investee, credit
    quality, likelihood of recovery, and our ability to hold the
    investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any
    anticipated recovery in fair market value.

Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, and

other-than-temporary

impairments for all reasons other than credit worthiness are
    included in Accumulated other comprehensive income. The
    amortization of premiums and discounts on the investments,
    realized gains and losses, and declines in value due to credit
    worthiness judged to be

other-than-temporary

on

available-for-sale

debt securities are included in Other income, net. We use the
    specific-identification method to determine cost in calculating
    realized gains and losses upon sale of short-term investments.

Equity Investments.

We make equity investments
    in privately held companies whose businesses are complementary
    to our business. These investments are accounted for under the
    cost method of accounting, as we hold less than 20% of the
    voting stock outstanding and do not exert significant influence
    over these companies. The investments are included in Other
    long-term assets. We assess the recoverability of these
    investments by reviewing various indicators of impairment and
    determine the fair value of these investments by performing a
    discounted cash flow analysis of estimated future cash flows if
    there are indicators of impairment. If a decline in value is
    determined to be

other-than-temporary,

impairment would be recognized and included in Other income,
    net. As of April 1, 2011 and April 2, 2010, we held
    equity investments in privately-held companies of
    $30 million and $22 million, respectively.

Other-than-temporary

impairments related to these investments were not material for
    the periods presented.

Derivative Instruments.

We transact business
    in various foreign currencies and have foreign currency risks
    associated with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
    foreign currencies. We utilize foreign currency forward
    contracts to reduce the risks associated with changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates. Our forward contracts generally have
    terms of six months or less and are transacted near month end
    periods. We do not use forward contracts for trading purposes.
    The gains and losses on the contracts are intended to offset the
    gains and losses on the underlying transactions. Both the
    changes in fair value of outstanding forward contracts and
    realized foreign exchange gains and losses are included in Other
    income, net. Contract fair values are determined based on quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets using
    inputs such as LIBOR, currency rates, forward points, and
    commonly quoted credit risk data. For each fiscal period
    presented in this report, outstanding derivative contracts and
    the related gains or losses were not material.

Senior Notes, Convertible Senior Notes, Note Hedges and
    Revolving Credit Facility.

In the second quarter
    of fiscal 2011, we issued $350 million in principal amount
    of 2.75% senior notes (“2.75% Notes”) due
    September 15, 2015 and $750 million in principal
    amount of 4.20% senior notes (“4.20% Notes”)
    due September 15, 2020, collectively referred to as the
    Senior Notes, for an aggregate principal amount of
    $1.1 billion. In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion in
    principal amount of 0.75% convertible senior notes
    (“0.75% Notes”) and $1.0 billion in
    principal amount of 1.00% convertible senior notes
    (“1.00% Notes”), collectively referred to as the
    Convertible Senior Notes. Our Senior Notes are recorded at cost
    based upon par value at issuance. Our Convertible Senior Notes
    are recorded at cost (in liability (debt) and equity (conversion
    option) components) based upon par value at issuance less a
    discount. The liability component is recognized at fair value on
    the issuance date, based on the fair value of a similar
    instrument that does not have a conversion feature at issuance.
    The excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Senior
    Notes over the fair value of the liability component is the
    equity component or debt discount.



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Such excess represents the estimated fair value of the
    conversion feature and is recorded as Additional paid-in
    capital. The debt discount is amortized using the Company’s
    effective interest rate over the term of the Convertible Senior
    Notes as a non-cash charge to interest expense included in
    Interest expense. Debt issuance costs were recorded in Other
    long-term assets and are being amortized to Interest expense
    using the effective interest method. In conjunction with the
    issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into note
    hedge transactions which provide us with the option to purchase
    additional common shares at a fixed price after conversion. The
    cost incurred in connection with the note hedge transactions,
    net of the related tax benefit, and the proceeds from the sale
    of warrants, was included as a net reduction in Additional
    paid-in capital. Borrowings under our $1 billion senior
    unsecured revolving credit facility are recognized at cost plus
    accrued interest based upon stated interest rates.

Trade
    Accounts Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
    and are not interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for
    doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible trade
    receivables. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts
    are recorded as General and administrative expenses. We review
    our trade receivables by aging category to identify specific
    customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In
    addition, we maintain an allowance for all other receivables not
    included in the specific reserve by applying specific
    percentages of projected uncollectible receivables to the
    various aging categories. In determining these percentages, we
    analyze our historical collection experience and current
    economic trends. We exercise judgment when determining the
    adequacy of these reserves as we evaluate historical bad debt
    trends, general economic conditions in the U.S. and
    internationally, and changes in customer financial conditions.
    We also offset deferred revenue against accounts receivable when
    channel inventories are in excess of specified levels and for
    transactions where collection of a receivable is not considered
    probable. The following table summarizes trade accounts
    receivable, net of allowances and reserves, for the periods
    presented:

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
    principally determined using the

first-in,

first-out method. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to
    its net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated
    excess, obsolescence or impaired balances. Inventory
    predominantly consists of deferred costs of revenue and finished
    goods. Deferred costs of revenue were $22 million as of
    April 1, 2011 and $23 million as of April 2,
    2010, of which $16 million and $17 million,
    respectively was related to consumer products that include
    content updates and will be recognized ratably over the term of
    the subscription.

Property
    and Equipment

Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements are stated at
    cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. We
    capitalize costs incurred during the application development
    stage related to the development of internal use software and
    enterprise cloud computing services. We expense costs incurred
    related to the planning and post-implementation phases of
    development as incurred. Depreciation and amortization is
    provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
    lives of the related assets. Buildings are depreciated over 20
    to 30 years.



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the
    life of the improvement or the initial lease term. Computer
    hardware and software, and office furniture and equipment are
    depreciated over three to five years. The following table

    respectively.

Business
    Combinations

We use the acquisition method of accounting under the
    authoritative guidance on business combinations. Each acquired
    company’s operating results are included in our
    consolidated financial statements starting on the date of
    acquisition. The purchase price is equivalent to the fair value
    of consideration transferred. Tangible and identifiable
    intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the
    date of acquisition are recorded at the acquisition date fair
    value. Goodwill is recognized for the excess of purchase price
    over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed.

Amounts allocated to assets and liabilities are based upon fair
    values. Such valuations require management to make significant
    estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to the
    identifiable intangible assets. Management makes estimates of
    fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable and
    that of a market participant. These estimates are based on
    historical experience and information obtained from the
    management of the acquired companies and are inherently
    uncertain. The separately identifiable intangible assets
    generally include developed technology, customer relationships
    and tradenames. We estimate the fair value of deferred revenue
    related to product support assumed in connection with
    acquisitions. The estimated fair value of deferred revenue is
    determined by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the
    obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to
    fulfill the support contracts are based on the historical direct
    costs related to providing the support.

For any given acquisition, we may identify certain
    pre-acquisition contingencies. We estimate the fair value of
    such contingencies, which are included under the acquisition
    method as part of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed, as
    appropriate. Differences from these estimates are recorded in
    the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which
    they are identified.

Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

Goodwill.

Our methodology for allocating the
    purchase price relating to acquisitions is determined through
    established valuation techniques. Goodwill is measured as the
    excess of the cost of the acquisition over the sum of the
    amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets
    acquired less liabilities assumed. We review goodwill for
    impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of the
    fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. In
    testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we determine the
    carrying value (book value) of the assets and liabilities for
    each reporting unit, which requires the allocation of goodwill
    to each reporting unit. We then estimate the fair value of each
    reporting unit, which are the same as our operating segments.
    The first step in evaluating goodwill for impairment is to
    determine if the estimated fair value of equity is greater than
    the carrying value of equity of each reporting unit. If step one
    indicates that impairment potentially exists, the second step is
    performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. Goodwill
    impairment exists when the estimated fair value of goodwill is
    less than its carrying value.

To determine the reporting units’ fair values in the
    current year analysis, we used the income approach which is
    based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that
    reporting unit. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit
    under the income approach is corroborated with the market
    approach which measures the value of a business through an
    analysis of recent sales or offerings of a comparable entity. We
    also consider our market capitalization on the date of the
    analysis. The methodology applied in the current year analysis
    was consistent with the methodology applied in the prior year
    analysis, but was based on updated assumptions, as appropriate.

Our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted
    revenue, operating costs and other relevant factors. To
    determine the reporting units’ carrying values, we
    allocated assets and liabilities based on either specific
    identification or by using judgment for the remaining assets and
    liabilities that are not specific to a reporting unit. Goodwill
    was allocated to the reporting units based on a combination of
    specific identification and relative fair values, which is
    consistent with the methodology utilized in the prior year
    impairment analysis. The use of relative fair values was
    necessary for certain reporting units due to impairment charges
    and changes in our operating structure in prior years.

Prior to performing our second step in the goodwill impairment
    analysis, we perform an assessment of long-lived assets,
    including intangible assets, for impairment.

Intangible Assets.

In connection with our
    acquisitions, we generally recognize assets for customer
    relationships, developed technology (which consists of acquired
    product rights, technologies, databases, and contracts),
    in-process research and development, trademarks and tradenames.
    Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to
    amortization. Finite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost
    less accumulated amortization. Such amortization is provided on
    a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
    respective assets, generally from one to eleven years.
    Amortization for developed technology is recognized in Cost of
    revenue as Amortization of acquired product rights. Amortization
    for customer relationships and certain tradenames is recognized
    in Operating expenses.

On an interim basis, we assess the impairment of identifiable
    intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that an asset group’s carrying amount may not be
    recoverable. Recoverability of certain finite-lived intangible
    assets, particularly customer relationships and finite-lived
    tradenames, would be measured by the comparison of the carrying
    amount of the asset group to which the assets are assigned to
    the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows the
    asset group is expected to generate. If the asset is considered
    to be impaired, such amount would be measured as the difference
    between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value.
    Recoverability and impairment of other finite-lived intangible
    assets, particularly developed technology and patents, would be
    measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the asset
    to the sum of undiscounted estimated future product revenues
    offset by estimated future costs to dispose of the product. In
    addition, for indefinite-lived intangible assets, we review such
    assets for impairment on an annual basis consistent with the



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

timing of the annual evaluation for goodwill. These assets
    generally include tradenames, trademarks and in-process research
    and development. Recoverability of infinite-lived intangible
    assets would be measured by the comparison of the carrying
    amount of the asset to the sum of the discounted estimated
    future cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the
    asset is considered to be impaired, such amount would be
    measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the
    asset and its fair value. Our cash flow assumptions are based on
    historical and future revenue, operating costs, and other
    relevant factors. Assumptions and estimates about the remaining
    useful lives of our intangible assets are subjective and are
    affected by changes to our business strategies. These estimates
    may be subject to change.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and
    liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for
    operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in each jurisdiction
    in which we operate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to
    taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets
    are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation
    allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is
    believed more likely than not to be realized.

We are required to compute our income taxes in each federal,
    state, and international jurisdiction in which we operate. This
    process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as
    well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and
    tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as
    accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax
    purposes. The income tax effects of the differences we identify
    are classified as current or long-term deferred tax assets and
    liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our judgments,
    assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for
    income tax take into account current tax laws, our
    interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of
    current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax
    authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax
    laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could
    significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of
    Operations. We must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax
    assets will be realized from future taxable income and, based on
    this assessment, establish a valuation allowance, if required.
    Our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a
    number of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including
    forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and the relative
    proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various
    domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. To
    the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the
    valuation allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a
    corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We apply the authoritative guidance on income taxes that
    prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is
    required to meet before being recognized in the financial
    statements. It also provides guidance on derecognition,
    measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
    in interim periods, disclosure and transition.

This guidance prescribes a two-step process to determine the
    amount of tax benefit to be recognized. The first step is to
    evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
    weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely
    than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including
    resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
    The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax
    benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be
    realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult
    and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to
    determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We
    reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis.
    This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited
    to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law,
    effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity.
    Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the
    recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax
    provision in the period.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on
    the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over
    the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting
    period of the respective award. No compensation cost is
    ultimately recognized for awards for which employees do not
    render the requisite service and are forfeited.

Fair Value of Stock-Based Awards.

We have
    issued and outstanding three types of stock-based awards: stock
    options, restricted stock units and stock purchase rights.

•

Stock Options.

We use the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock
    options. The determination of the grant date fair value of
    options using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock
    price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and
    subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock
    price volatility over the expected life of the awards, actual
    and projected employee stock option exercise and cancellation
    behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. We
    estimate the expected life of options granted based on an
    analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and
    post-vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the
    contractual life of the option. Expected volatility is based on
    the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate
    with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility
    of traded options. The risk free interest rate is equal to the
    U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal
    to the expected life. We do not currently pay cash dividends on
    our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the
    foreseeable future. Accordingly, our expected dividend yield is
    zero.

•

Restricted Stock Units.

The fair value of each
    Restricted Stock Unit (“RSU”) is equal to the market
    value of Symantec’s common stock on the date of grant.

•

Stock Purchase Rights.

The fair value of each
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) right is equal
    to the 15% discount on the shares on the date of purchase.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

A significant portion of our revenue and net income (loss) is
    derived from international sales and independent agents and
    distributors. Fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against
    foreign currencies, changes in local regulatory or economic
    conditions, piracy, or nonperformance by independent agents or
    distributors could adversely affect operating results.

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and
    cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade accounts
    receivable, and forward foreign exchange contracts. Our
    investment portfolio is diversified and consists of investment
    grade securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of
    credit risk exposure to any one issuer and to any one country.
    We are exposed to credit risks in the event of default by the
    issuers to the extent of the amount recorded in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. The credit risk in our trade accounts receivable
    is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process,
    reasonably short collection terms, and the geographical
    dispersion of sales transactions. We maintain reserves for
    potential credit losses and such losses have been within
    management’s expectations. See Note 10 for details of
    significant customers.

Advertising
    Costs

Advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred and
    include electronic and print advertising, trade shows,
    collateral production, placement fees with hardware
    manufacturers, and all forms of direct marketing. Advertising
    costs included in Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2011,
    2010, and 2009 were $668 million, $615 million, and
    $572 million, respectively.

Recently
    Issued and Adopted Authoritative Guidance

In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we adopted new
    authoritative guidance which changes the model for determining
    whether an entity should consolidate a variable interest entity
    (“VIE”). The standard replaces the quantitative-based
    risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise
    has a controlling financial interest in a VIE with an approach
    focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct
    the activities of a VIE and the obligation to absorb losses of
    the entity or the right to receive the entity’s residual
    returns. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on
    our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2011.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, updated authoritative
    guidance was issued to modify Step 1 of the goodwill impairment
    test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
    For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step
    2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not
    that a goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is
    more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, we will
    need to consider whether there are any adverse qualitative
    factors indicating that an impairment may exist. The adoption of
    this guidance will be effective beginning April 2, 2011,
    the first quarter of our fiscal 2012. The updated guidance may
    require us to perform the step 2 for our Services reporting unit
    upon adoption. The adoption of this guidance could potentially
    result in an impairment of the goodwill recorded in the Services
    reporting unit of up to $19 million.

Note 2.

Fair
    Value Measurements

We measure assets and liabilities at fair value based on an
    expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on
    fair value measurements, which represents the amount that would
    be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability, as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between
    market participants. As such, fair value may be based on
    assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an
    asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value
    measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring
    fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby
    inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned a
    hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of
    inputs to measure fair value:

•

Level 1:

Observable inputs that reflect
    quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities
    in active markets.

•

Level 2:

Observable inputs that reflect
    quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets
    that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices
    that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs
    that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable
    market data by correlation or other means.

•

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs reflecting
    our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to
    determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be
    consistent with market participant assumptions that are
    reasonably available.

Assets Held for Sale.

Assets held for sale
    during fiscal 2011 were measured at fair value, less costs to
    sell, using Level 2 inputs consisting of recent offers made
    by third parties to purchase the properties or valuation
    appraisals. As of April 1, 2011, we reclassified all
    remaining assets held for sale valued at $2 million to
    assets held for use within Property and equipment. During fiscal
    2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded impairments as a result of fair
    value measurements of $2 million, $20 million, and
    $46 million, respectively. As of April 2, 2010 assets
    held for sale was $34 million. During fiscal years 2010 and
    2009, we sold assets held for sale for $42 million and
    $40 million which resulted in a $10 million and
    immaterial loss, respectively. Assets held for sale were
    included in Other current assets.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets.

During
    fiscal 2011, we recorded an impairment charge of
    $27 million which reduced the gross carrying value of
    indefinite-lived tradenames. This impairment charge was due to
    reductions in expected future cash flows for certain
    indefinite-lived tradenames related to the Consumer segment.
    This impairment charge was recorded within Impairment of
    intangible assets and goodwill on the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

Long-Term Debt.

In fiscal 2011, we repurchased
    $500 million of aggregate principal amount of our
    0.75% Notes , which had a net book value of
    $481 million. Concurrently with the repurchase, we sold a
    proportionate share of the initial note hedges back to the note
    hedge counterparties for approximately $13 million. These
    transactions resulted in a loss from extinguishment of debt of
    approximately $16 million, which represents

    Statements — (Continued)

the difference between book value of the notes net of the
    remaining unamortized discount prior to repurchase and the fair
    value of the liability component of the notes upon repurchase.
    The fair value of the liability component was calculated to be
    $497 million using Level 2 inputs based on market
    prices for similar convertible debt instruments and resulting
    yields. See Note 6 for further details.

    connection with each of these acquisitions, which resulted
    primarily from our expectation of synergies from the integration
    of the acquired company’s technology with our technology
    and the acquired company’s access to our global
    distribution network. In addition, each acquired company
    provided a knowledgeable and experienced workforce. Most of the
    goodwill from the PC Tools Pty Limited (“PC Tools”)
    acquisition was tax deductible, while goodwill for the other
    acquisitions was not tax deductible or was not material. The
    results of operations for the acquired companies have been
    included in our results of operations since their respective
    acquisition dates. AppStream, Inc. (“AppStream”), and
    the Other acquisitions are included in our Security and
    Compliance segment and SwapDrive, Inc. (“SwapDrive”)
    and PC Tools are included in our Consumer segment.

During fiscal 2011, we recorded an impairment of

    indefinite-lived tradenames. This impairment charge was due to
    reductions in expected future cash flows for certain
    indefinite-lived tradenames related to the Consumer segment.
    This impairment charge was recorded within Impairment of
    intangible assets and goodwill on the Consolidated Statements of

Note 5.

Investment
    in Joint Venture

On February 5, 2008, Symantec formed Huawei-Symantec
    Technologies Co., Ltd. (“joint venture”) with a
    subsidiary of Huawei Technologies Co., Limited
    (“Huawei”). The joint venture is domiciled in Hong
    Kong with principal operations in Chengdu, China. We contributed
    cash of $150 million, licenses related to certain
    intellectual property and intangible assets in exchange for 49%
    of the outstanding common shares of the joint venture. The joint
    venture develops, manufactures, supports and markets security
    and storage appliances and solutions to global
    telecommunications carriers and enterprise customers. Huawei
    contributed its telecommunications storage and security business
    assets, engineering, sales and marketing resources, personnel,
    and licenses related to intellectual property in exchange for a
    51% ownership interest in the joint venture.

The contribution of assets to the joint venture was accounted
    for at its carrying value. The historical carrying value of the
    assets contributed by Symantec comprised a significant portion
    of the net assets of the joint venture. As a result, our
    carrying value of the investment in the joint venture exceeded
    our proportionate share in the book value of the joint venture
    by approximately $75 million upon formation of the joint
    venture. As the contributions for both Symantec and Huawei were
    recorded at historical carrying value by the joint venture, this
    basis difference is attributable to the contributed identified
    intangible assets. The basis difference is being amortized over
    a weighted-average period of 9 years, the estimated useful
    lives of the underlying identified intangible assets to which
    the basis difference is attributed.

We have a one-time option to purchase an additional two percent
    ownership interest from Huawei for $28 million. The period
    to exercise this option began on February 5, 2011. We
    determined the value of the option using the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model. The value of the option is not considered
    material to the financial statements. We have concluded that the
    option does not meet the definition of a derivative under the
    authoritative guidance. As of the date of this filing, we
    continue to evaluate the exercise of this option.

If Symantec declines its option to purchase the additional two
    percent ownership interest, Symantec and Huawei would each then
    have the right to purchase all of the other partner’s
    ownership interest through a bid process. As of the date of this
    filing, this bid process has not been triggered.

We account for our investment in the joint venture under the
    equity method of accounting. Under this method, we record our
    proportionate share of the joint venture’s net income or
    loss based on the quarterly financial statements of the joint
    venture. We record our proportionate share of net income or loss
    one quarter in arrears. In determining our share of the joint
    venture’s net income or loss, we adjust the joint
    venture’s reported results to recognize the amortization
    expense associated with the basis difference described above.

Debt

Senior
    notes

In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we issued
    $350 million in principal amount of 2.75% Notes due
    September 15, 2015 and $750 million in principal
    amount of 4.20% Notes due September 15, 2020,
    collectively referred to as the “Senior Notes”, for an
    aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion. The
    2.75% Notes and 4.20% Notes are senior unsecured
    obligations of the Company that rank equally in right of payment
    with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated
    obligations and are redeemable by us at any time, subject to a
    “make-whole” premium. Our proceeds were
    $1.1 billion, net of an issuance discount of approximately
    $3 million resulting from sale of the notes at a yield
    slightly above the stated coupons. We also incurred issuance
    costs of approximately $6.2 million. Both the discount and
    issuance costs are being amortized as incremental non-cash
    interest expense over the respective terms of the notes. The
    2.75% Notes and 4.20% Notes bear interest at 2.75% and
    4.20% per annum, respectively. Interest is payable semiannually
    in arrears on the 15th of March and September, beginning
    March 15, 2011.

Convertible
    senior notes

In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion in principal amount of
    0.75% Notes due 2011 and $1.0 billion in principal
    amount of 1.00% Notes due 2013, collectively referred to as
    the “Convertible Senior Notes”. We received proceeds
    of $2.1 billion from the Convertible Senior Notes and
    incurred net transaction costs of approximately
    $33 million, of which $9 million was allocated to
    equity and the remainder allocated proportionately to the
    0.75% Notes and 1.00% Notes. The 0.75% Notes and
    1.00% Notes were each issued at par and bear interest at
    0.75% and 1.00% per annum, respectively. Interest is payable
    semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15,
    beginning December 15, 2006.

As of April 1, 2011, the remaining weighted-average
    amortization period of the discount and debt issuance costs is
    approximately 2 years and the if-converted value of the
    Convertible Senior Notes does not exceed the principal amount of
    the Convertible Senior Notes.

Each $1,000 of principal of the Convertible Senior Notes will
    initially be convertible into 52.2951 shares of Symantec
    common stock, which is the equivalent of $19.12 per share,
    subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.
    Holders of the Convertible Senior Notes may convert their
    Convertible Senior Notes prior to maturity during specified
    periods as follows: (1) during any calendar quarter,
    beginning after June 30, 2006, if the closing price of our
    common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive
    trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately
    preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the applicable
    conversion price per share; (2) if specified corporate
    transactions, including a change in control, occur;
    (3) with respect to the 0.75% Notes, at any time on or
    after April 5, 2011, and with respect to the
    1.00% Notes, at any time on or after April 5, 2013; or
    (4) during the five

business-day

period after any five consecutive

trading-day

period during which the trading price of the Convertible Senior
    Notes falls below a certain threshold. Upon conversion, we would
    pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares
    of Symantec common stock, up to the principal amount of the
    note. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be
    paid in cash or in stock at our option. Holders who convert
    their Convertible Senior Notes in connection with a change in
    control may be entitled to a “make whole” premium in
    the form of an increase in the conversion rate. As of
    April 1, 2011, none of the conditions allowing holders of
    the Convertible Senior Notes to convert had been met. In
    addition, upon a change in control of Symantec, the holders of
    the Convertible Senior Notes may require us to repurchase for
    cash all or any portion of their Convertible Senior Notes for
    100% of the principal amount.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes,
    we entered into note hedge transactions with affiliates of
    certain initial purchasers whereby we have the option to
    purchase up to 110 million shares of our common stock at a
    price of $19.12 per share. The options as to 58 million
    shares expire on June 15, 2011 and the options as to
    52 million shares expire on June 15, 2013. The options
    must be settled in the same manner as we settle the Convertible
    Senior Notes (cash or net shares). The cost of the note hedge
    transactions to us was approximately $592 million. In
    addition, we sold warrants to affiliates of certain initial
    purchasers whereby they have the option to



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

purchase up to 110 million shares of our common stock at a
    price of $27.3175 per share. The warrants expire on various
    dates from July 2011 through August 2013 and must be settled in
    net shares. We received approximately $326 million in cash
    proceeds from the sale of these warrants.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we repurchased
    $500 million of aggregate principal amount of our
    0.75% Notes. Concurrently with the repurchase, we sold a
    proportionate share of the initial note hedges back to the note
    hedge counterparties for approximately $13 million. These
    transactions resulted in a loss from extinguishment of debt of
    approximately $16 million, which represents the difference
    between book value of the notes net of the remaining unamortized
    discount prior to repurchase and the fair value of the liability
    component of the notes upon repurchase. The net cost of the
    repurchase of the 0.75% Notes and the concurrent sale of
    the note hedges was $497 million in cash.

The remaining Convertible Senior Notes will have no impact on
    diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) until the price of
    our common stock exceeds the conversion price of $19.12 per
    share because the principal amount of the Convertible Senior
    Notes will be settled in cash upon conversion. Prior to
    conversion, we will include the effect of the additional shares
    that may be issued if our common stock price exceeds $19.12 per
    share using the treasury stock method. As a result, for the
    first $1.00 by which the average price of our common stock for a
    quarterly period exceeds $19.12 per share there would be
    dilution of approximately 1.6 million shares on the
    0.75% Notes and 2.6 million shares on the
    1.00% Notes. As the share price continues to increase,
    additional dilution would occur at a declining rate such that an
    average price of $27.3175 per share would yield cumulative
    dilution of approximately 25.1 million shares. If the
    average price of our common stock exceeds $27.3175 per share for
    a quarterly period we will also include the effect of the
    additional potential shares that may be issued related to the
    warrants using the treasury stock method. The Convertible Senior
    Notes along with the warrants have a combined dilutive effect
    such that for the first $1.00 by which the average price exceeds
    $27.3175 per share there would be cumulative dilution of
    approximately 30.1 million shares prior to conversion. As
    the share price continues to increase, additional dilution would
    occur but at a declining rate.

Prior to conversion, the note hedge transactions are not
    considered for purposes of the EPS calculation, as their effect
    would be anti-dilutive. Upon conversion, the note hedge will
    automatically serve to neutralize the dilutive effect of the
    remaining Convertible Senior Notes when the stock price is above
    $19.12 per share. For example, if upon conversion the price of
    our common stock was $28.3175 per share, the cumulative effect
    of approximately 30.1 million shares in the example above
    would be reduced to approximately 3 million shares.

The preceding calculations assume that the average price of our
    common stock exceeds the respective conversion prices during the
    period for which EPS is calculated and excludes any potential
    adjustments to the conversion ratio provided under the terms of
    the Convertible Senior Notes. See Note 13 for information
    regarding the impact on EPS of the Convertible Senior Notes and
    warrants in the current period.

Revolving
    credit facility

In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we entered into a
    four-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit
    facility that expires in September 2014 (the “credit
    facility”). The credit facility provides that we may borrow
    up to $1.0 billion under revolving loans. Revolving loans
    under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, either
    at a rate equal to a) LIBOR plus a margin based on our
    consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the credit facility
    agreement or b) the bank’s prime rate plus a margin
    based on our consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the
    credit facility agreement. Under the terms of this credit
    facility, we must comply with certain financial and
    non-financial covenants, including a covenant to maintain a
    specified ratio of debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest,
    taxes, depreciation and amortization). As of April 1, 2011,
    we were in compliance with all required covenants, and there was
    no outstanding balance on the credit facility.



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

In addition, in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we terminated
    our previous $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit
    facility that we entered into in July 2006. At the time of
    termination, there was no outstanding balance on the credit
    facility. The original expiration date for this credit facility
    was July 2011.

Note 7.

Restructuring

Our restructuring costs and liabilities consist primarily of
    severance, benefits, and facilities costs. Severance and
    benefits generally include severance payments, outplacement
    services, health insurance coverage, effects of foreign currency
    exchange, and legal costs. Facilities costs generally include
    rent expense, less expected sublease income and lease
    termination costs. Restructuring expenses are included in the
    Other segment.

Fiscal
    2011 Restructuring Plan (“Fiscal 2011
    Plan”)

In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, management approved and
    initiated a plan to expand our consulting partner sales and
    delivery capabilities. This action was initiated to expand our
    partner eco-system to better leverage their customer reach and
    operational scale, which is resulting in a headcount reduction
    within our consulting services organization. It is intended for
    our customers to have greater choice in their providers for
    technology services. The results of such action are to pay
    severance and benefits to terminated employees. This plan is
    expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal
    2012, and the total remaining exit costs are estimated to range
    from $5 million to $10 million.

Fiscal
    2010 Restructuring Plan (“Fiscal 2010
    Plan”)

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, management approved and
    initiated a plan to reduce worldwide operating costs through a
    workforce realignment and reduce operating costs through a
    facilities consolidation. These actions were initiated to
    appropriately allocate resources to our key strategic
    initiatives and streamline our operations to deliver better and
    more efficient support to our customers and employees. During
    fiscal 2011, we terminated operating leases and consolidated
    facilities in North America and Europe. Total remaining costs
    are estimated to range from $5 million to $8 million
    and are expected to be substantially completed by the second
    quarter of fiscal 2012. Excess facility obligations are expected
    to be paid over the respective lease terms, the longest of which
    extends through fiscal 2016.

Other
    Exit and Disposal Costs

Excess Facilities.

Largely as a result of
    business acquisitions, management may deem certain facilities to
    be in excess either at the time of acquisition or for a period
    of time after the acquisition in conjunction with our efforts to
    integrate and streamline our operations. As of April 1,
    2011, liabilities for these excess facility obligations at
    several locations around the world, are expected to be paid over
    the respective lease terms, the longest of which extends through
    fiscal 2018.

Purchase
    Obligations

We have purchase obligations of $373 million as of
    April 1, 2011 that are associated with agreements for
    purchases of goods or services. Management believes that
    cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and we expect to
    make future cash payments according to the contract terms.

Indemnification

As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we
    indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or
    occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at
    our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of
    future payments we could be required to make under these
    indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have
    directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage that
    reduces our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of
    any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of
    these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable
    insurance coverage is minimal.

We provide limited product warranties and the majority of our
    software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify
    licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from
    claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual
    property rights of a third party. Historically, payments made
    under these provisions have been immaterial. We monitor the
    conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a
    loss has occurred.

Litigation
    Contingencies

For a discussion of our pending tax litigation with the Internal
    Revenue Service relating to the 2000 and 2001 tax years of
    Veritas, see Note 12.

On July 7, 2004, a purported class action complaint
    entitled Paul Kuck, et al. v. Veritas Software Corporation,
    et al. was filed in the United States District Court for the
    District of Delaware. The lawsuit alleges violations of federal
    securities laws in connection with Veritas’ announcement on
    July 6, 2004 that it expected results of operations for the
    fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2004 to fall below earlier
    estimates. The complaint generally seeks an unspecified amount
    of damages. Subsequently, additional purported class action
    complaints have been filed in Delaware federal court, and, on
    March 3, 2005, the Court entered an order consolidating
    these actions and appointing lead plaintiffs and counsel. A
    consolidated amended complaint (“CAC”), was filed on
    May 27, 2005, expanding the class period from
    April 23, 2004 through July 6, 2004. The CAC also
    named another officer as a defendant and added allegations that
    Veritas and the named officers made false or misleading
    statements in press

    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

releases and SEC filings regarding Veritas’ financial
    results, which allegedly contained revenue recognized from
    contracts that were unsigned or lacked essential terms. The
    defendants to this matter filed a motion to dismiss the CAC in
    July 2005; the motion was denied in May 2006. In April 2008, the
    parties filed a stipulation of settlement. On July 31,
    2008, the Court held a final approval hearing and, on
    August 5, 2008, the Court entered an order approving the
    settlement. An objector to the fees portion of the settlement
    has lodged an appeal. On October 4, 2010, the Third Circuit
    Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the District Court
    approving the fee request.

In fiscal 2008, we recorded an accrual in the amount of
    $21.5 million for this matter and, pursuant to the terms of
    the settlement, we established a settlement fund of
    $21.5 million on May 1, 2008. On February 4,
    2011, the District Court entered an order for disbursement of
    that fund.

We are also involved in a number of other judicial and
    administrative proceedings that are incidental to our business.
    Although adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur in one or
    more of the cases, it is not possible to estimate the possible
    loss or losses from each of these cases. The final resolution of
    these lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, is not
    expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition or results of operations.

Segment
    Information

As of April 1, 2011, our five reportable segments are the
    same as our operating segments and are as follows:

•

Consumer.

Our Consumer segment focuses on
    delivering Internet security, PC

tune-up,

and
    online backup solutions and services to individual users and
    home offices.

•

Security and Compliance.

Our Security and
    Compliance segment focuses on providing large, medium, and
    small-sized businesses with solutions for endpoint security and
    management, compliance, messaging management, data loss
    prevention, encryption, and authentication services. These
    products allow our customers to secure, provision, and remotely
    manage their laptops, PCs, mobile devices, and servers. We also
    provide our customers with solutions delivered through our SaaS
    security offerings.

•

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

protection solutions across heterogeneous storage and server
    platforms, as well as solutions delivered through our SaaS
    offerings.

•

Services.

Our Services segment provides
    customers with implementation services and solutions designed to
    assist them in maximizing the value of their Symantec software.
    Our offerings include consulting, business critical services,
    education, and managed security services.

•

Other.

Our Other segment is comprised of
    sunset products and products nearing the end of their life
    cycle. It also includes general and administrative expenses;
    amortization of acquired product rights, intangible assets, and
    other assets; goodwill impairment charges; charges such as
    stock-based compensation and restructuring; and certain indirect
    costs that are not charged to the other operating segments.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
    described in Note 1. There are no intersegment sales. Our
    chief operating decision maker evaluates performance primarily
    based on net revenue. Except for goodwill, as disclosed in
    Note 4, the majority of our assets are not discretely
    identified by segment. The depreciation and amortization of our
    property, equipment, and leasehold improvements are allocated
    based on headcount, unless specifically identified by segment.

Employee
    Benefits and Stock-Based Compensation

401(k)
    plan

We maintain a salary deferral 401(k) plan for all of our
    domestic employees. This plan allows employees to contribute up
    to 50% of their pretax salary up to the maximum dollar
    limitation prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. We match 50%
    of the employee’s contribution. The maximum match in any
    given plan year is 3% of the employees’ eligible
    compensation, up to $6,000. Our contributions under the plan
    were $22 million, $22 million, and $20 million in
    fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

Stock
    purchase plans

    Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In September 2008, our stockholders approved the 2008 Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (“2008 ESPP”) and reserved
    20 million shares of common stock for issuance thereunder.
    In September 2010, the 2008 ESPP was amended by our stockholders
    to increase the shares available for issuance thereunder by
    20 million. As of April 1, 2011, 9 million shares
    have been issued under this plan and 31 million shares
    remained available for issuance under the 2008 ESPP.

Subject to certain limitations, our employees may elect to have
    2% to 10% of their compensation withheld through payroll
    deductions to purchase shares of common stock under the 2008
    ESPP. Employees purchase shares of common stock at a price per
    share equal to 85% of the fair market value on the purchase date
    at the end of each six-month purchase period.

    Executive Officers’ Stock Purchase Plan

In September 2002, our stockholders approved the 2002 Executive
    Officers’ Stock Purchase Plan and reserved
    250,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder. The
    purpose of the plan is to provide executive officers with a
    means to acquire an equity interest in Symantec at fair market
    value by applying a portion or all of their respective bonus
    payments towards the purchase price. As of April 1, 2011,
    40,401 shares have been issued under the plan and
    209,599 shares remained available for future issuance.
    Shares reserved for issuance under this plan have not been
    adjusted for stock dividends.

Stock
    award plans

2000 Director
    Equity Incentive Plan

In September 2000, our stockholders approved the
    2000 Director Equity Incentive Plan and reserved
    50,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder.
    Stockholders increased the number of shares of stock that may be
    issued by 50,000 in both September 2004 and September 2007. The
    purpose of this plan is to provide the members of the Board of
    Directors with an opportunity to receive common stock for all or
    a portion of the retainer payable to each director for serving
    as a member. Each director may elect any portion up to 100% of
    the retainer to be paid in the form of stock. As of
    April 1, 2011, a total of 116,049 shares have been
    issued under this plan and 33,951 shares remained available
    for future issuance.

    Equity Incentive Plan

Under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, (“2004 Plan”)
    our Board of Directors, or a committee of the Board of
    Directors, may grant incentive and nonqualified stock options,
    stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units
    (“RSUs”), or restricted stock awards
    (“RSAs”) to employees, officers, directors,
    consultants, independent contractors, and advisors to us, or to
    any parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of ours. The purpose of the
    2004 Plan is to attract, retain, and motivate eligible persons
    whose present and potential contributions are important to our
    success by offering them an opportunity to participate in our
    future performance through equity awards of stock options and
    stock bonuses. Under the terms of the 2004 Plan, the exercise
    price of stock options may not be less than 100% of the fair
    market value on the date of grant. Options generally vest over a
    four-year period. Options granted prior to October 2005
    generally have a maximum term of ten years and options granted
    thereafter generally have a maximum term of seven years.

As of April 1, 2011, we have reserved 189 million
    shares for issuance under the 2004 Plan. These shares include
    18 million shares originally reserved for issuance under
    the 2004 Plan upon its adoption by our stockholders in September
    2004, 26 million shares that were transferred to the 2004
    Plan from the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan, (“1996
    Plan”), and 40 million, 50 million and
    55 million shares that were approved for issuance
    thereunder on the amendment and restatement of the 2004 Plan at
    our 2006, 2008 and 2010 annual meeting of stockholders,
    respectively. In addition to the shares currently reserved under
    the 2004 Plan, any shares reacquired by us from options
    outstanding under the 1996 Plan upon their cancellation will
    also be added to the 2004 Plan reserve. As of April 1,
    2011, 98 million shares remained available for future grant
    under the 2004 Plan.

Other
    stock option plans

Options remain outstanding under several other stock option
    plans, including the 2001 Non-Qualified Equity Incentive Plan,
    the 1996 Plan, and various plans assumed in connection with
    acquisitions. No further options may be granted under any of
    these plans.

Valuation
    of stock-based awards

The fair value of each stock option granted under our equity
    incentive plans is estimated on the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
    weighted-average assumptions:

Changes in the Black-Scholes valuation assumptions and our

    compensation expense due to changes in our valuation assumptions
    of stock options.

All of the $45 million total valuation allowance provided
    against our deferred tax assets is attributable to
    acquisition-related assets. The valuation allowance decreased by
    a net of $22 million in fiscal 2011, resulting from the
    release of $22 million of Irish deferred tax assets related
    to our Veritas

2000-2001

court case decision, current year utilization, and a favorable
    change in our ability to use deferred tax assets on our tax
    returns; and a $6 million decrease due to utilization of
    capital losses, partially offset by a $6 million increase
    attributable to intangible assets and other miscellaneous items.

As of April 1, 2011, we have U.S. federal net
    operating losses attributable to various acquired companies of
    approximately $170 million, which, if not used, will expire
    between fiscal 2012 and 2029. These net operating loss
    carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Internal
    Revenue Code § 382, but are expected to be fully
    realized. Furthermore, we have U.S. state net operating
    loss and credit carryforwards attributable to various acquired
    companies of approximately $344 million and
    $13 million, respectively, which will expire in various
    fiscal years. In addition, we have foreign net operating loss
    carryforwards attributable to various acquired foreign companies
    of approximately $583 million net of valuation allowances,
    which, under current applicable foreign tax law, can be carried
    forward indefinitely.

As a result of the impairment of goodwill in fiscal year 2009,
    we have cumulative pre-tax book losses, as measured by the
    current and prior two years. We considered the negative evidence
    of this cumulative pre-tax book loss position on our ability to
    continue to recognize deferred tax assets that are dependent
    upon future taxable income for realization. We considered the
    following as positive evidence: the vast majority of the
    goodwill impairment is not deductible for tax purposes and thus
    will not result in tax losses; we have a strong, consistent
    taxpaying history; we have substantial U.S. federal income
    tax carryback potential; and we have substantial amounts of
    scheduled future reversals of taxable



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities. We have
    concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the negative
    evidence and, thus, that the deferred tax assets as of
    April 1, 2011 of $536 million, after application of
    the valuation allowances, are realizable on a “more likely
    than not” basis.

As of April 1, 2011, no provision has been made for federal
    or state income taxes on $2.1 billion of cumulative
    unremitted earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries since
    we plan to indefinitely reinvest these earnings. As of
    April 1, 2011, the unrecognized deferred tax liability for
    these earnings was $585 million.

The Company adopted the provisions of new authoritative guidance
    on income taxes, effective March 31, 2007. The cumulative
    effect of adopting this new guidance was a decrease in tax
    reserves of $16 million, resulting in a decrease to Veritas
    goodwill of $10 million, an increase of $5 million to
    the March 31, 2007 Accumulated earnings balance, and a
    $1 million increase in Additional paid-in capital. Upon
    adoption, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits as
    of March 31, 2007 was $456 million, exclusive of
    interest and penalties.

The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax
    benefits since adoption were as follows (

2011. This gross liability is reduced by offsetting tax benefits
    associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer
    pricing adjustments, interest deductions, and state income
    taxes, as well as payments made to date.

Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at April 1, 2011,
    $516 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the
    Company’s effective tax rate, while $11 million would
    affect the cumulative translation adjustments. However, one or
    more of these unrecognized tax benefits could be subject to a
    valuation allowance if and when recognized in a future period,
    which could impact the timing of any related effective tax rate
    benefit.

Our policy to include interest and penalties related to gross
    unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes
    did not change upon the adoption of the new authoritative
    guidance on income taxes. At April 1, 2011, before any tax
    benefits, we had $91 million of accrued interest and
    accrued penalties on unrecognized tax benefits. Interest
    included in our provision for income taxes was approximately
    $6 million for the year ended April 1, 2011. If the
    accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable,
    amounts accrued will be reduced in the period that such
    determination is made, and reflected as a reduction of the
    overall income tax provision.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. on a federal basis
    and in many U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two
    most significant tax jurisdictions are the U.S. and
    Ireland. Our tax filings remain subject to examination by
    applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time
    following the tax year to which those filings relate. Our 2002
    through 2009 tax years remain subject to examination by the
    Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for U.S. federal
    tax purposes, and our 2006 through 2009 fiscal years remain
    subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies
    for Irish tax purposes. Other significant jurisdictions include
    California, Japan, the UK and India. As of April 1, 2011,
    we are in appeals with the IRS regarding Veritas
    U.S. federal income taxes for the 2002 through 2005 tax
    years, and under examination regarding Symantec
    U.S. federal income taxes for the fiscal years 2005 through
    2008 tax years. In addition, we are under examination by the
    California Franchise Tax Board for the Symantec California
    income taxes for the 2005 through 2006 tax years. We are also
    under audit by the Indian income tax authorities for fiscal
    years 2006 through 2007.

On March 29, 2006, we received a Notice of Deficiency from
    the IRS claiming that we owe $867 million of additional
    taxes, excluding interest and penalties, for the 2000 and 2001
    tax years based on an audit of Veritas. On June 26, 2006,
    we filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court protesting the
    IRS claim for such additional taxes. During July 2008, we
    completed the trial phase of the Tax Court case, which dealt
    with the remaining issue covered in the assessment. At trial,
    the IRS changed its position with respect to this remaining
    issue, which decreased the remaining amount at issue from
    $832 million to $545 million, excluding interest.

On December 10, 2009, the U.S. Tax Court issued its
    opinion, finding that our transfer pricing methodology, with
    appropriate adjustments, was the best method for assessing the
    value of the transaction at issue between Veritas and its
    offshore subsidiary. The Tax Court judge provided guidance as to
    how adjustments would be made to correct the application of the
    method used by Veritas. We remeasured and decreased our
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits accordingly, resulting
    in a $79 million tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal
    2010. In June 2010, we reached an agreement with the IRS
    concerning the amount of the adjustment related to the
    U.S. Tax Court decision. As a result of the agreement, we
    further reduced our liability for unrecognized tax benefits,
    resulting in an additional $39 million tax benefit in the
    first quarter of fiscal 2011. In March 2011, we reached
    agreement with Irish Revenue concerning compensating adjustments
    arising from this matter, resulting in an additional
    $10 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2011. This matter has now been closed and no further adjustments
    to the accrued liability are warranted.

On December 2, 2009, we received a Revenue Agent’s
    Report from the IRS for the Veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years
    assessing additional taxes due. We agree with $30 million
    of the tax assessment, excluding interest, but will contest the
    other $80 million of tax assessed and all penalties. The
    unagreed issues concern transfer pricing matters comparable to
    the one that was resolved in our favor in the

Veritas v.
    Commissioner

Tax Court decision. On January 15, 2010,
    we filed a protest with the IRS in connection with the
    $80 million of tax assessed. On September 28, 2010,
    the case was formally accepted into the IRS Appeals process for
    consideration. This matter remains outstanding.



SYMANTEC

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

In July 2008, we reached an agreement with the IRS concerning
    our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made
    from a Veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the July 2005
    acquisition. The distribution was intended to be made pursuant
    to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and therefore
    eligible for a 5.25% effective U.S. federal rate of tax, in
    lieu of the 35% statutory rate. The final impact of this
    agreement remains uncertain since this relates to the taxability
    of earnings that are otherwise the subject of transfer pricing
    matters at issue in the IRS examination of Veritas tax years

2002-2005.

To the extent that we owe taxes as a result of these transfer
    pricing matters in years prior to the distribution, we
    anticipate that the incremental tax due from this negotiated
    agreement will decrease. We currently estimate that the most
    probable outcome from this negotiated agreement will be that we
    will owe $13 million or less, for which an accrual has
    already been made.

We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing income tax
    controversies and the impact, if any, of the expected tolling of
    the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed on the basis
    of the weighted average number of shares of common stock
    outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share also
    includes the incremental effect of dilutive potential common
    shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock
    method. Dilutive potential common shares include shares
    underlying outstanding stock options, restricted stock, warrants
    and Convertible Senior Notes.

The components of earnings per share are as follows:

For these fiscal years, the effects of the warrants issued and
    the option purchased in connection with the Convertible Senior
    Notes were excluded because they have no impact on diluted
    earnings per share until our average stock price for the
    applicable period reaches $27.3175 per share and $19.12 per
    share, respectively.

Subsequent
    Events

On May 19, 2011, we signed a definitive agreement to
    acquire Clearwell Systems Inc., a Mountain View based,
    privately-held provider of eDiscovery solutions. We expect to
    acquire Clearwell Systems Inc. for a purchase price of
    approximately $390 million, net of cash acquired. The
    agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including
    regulatory approval and is expected to close during the second
    quarter of our fiscal 2012.
