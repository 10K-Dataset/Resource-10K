PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Symantec is a global provider of security, storage, and systems
    management solutions that help businesses and consumers secure
    and manage their information. We conduct our business in three
    geographic regions: Americas, which is comprised of the United
    States, Canada, and Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and
    Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia Pacific Japan
    (“APJ”).

Our

go-to-market

network includes direct, inside, and channel sales resources
    that support our ecosystem of more than 40,000 partners
    worldwide. We also maintain various distribution and services
    relationships with original equipment manufacturers
    (“OEMs”), Internet service providers
    (“ISPs”), and retail and online stores. We provide
    customers with software and services that protect, manage, and
    control information risks related to security, backup and
    recovery, storage, compliance, and systems management.

Founded in 1982, Symantec has operations in more than 40
    countries and our principal executive offices are located at 350
    Ellis Street, Mountain View, California, 94043. Our telephone
    number at that location is

(650) 527-8000.

Our home page on the Internet is

www.symantec.com.

Other
    than the information expressly set forth in this annual report,
    the information contained, or referred to, on our website is not
    part of this annual report.

Strategy

Symantec’s strategy is to provide software and services to
    secure and manage information regardless of device, platform, or
    where it resides. We help individuals, small businesses, and
    global organizations ensure that their information, technology
    infrastructures, and related processes are protected, managed
    easily, and controlled automatically. In addition to providing
    customers with traditional software solutions, we continue to
    expand our Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) based
    solutions and appliance based solutions, giving customers the
    choice for how they secure and manage information.

We operate primarily in three diversified markets within the
    software sector: security, storage, and systems management. We
    believe these markets are converging as customers increasingly
    require our help mitigating their risk profiles and managing
    their storage needs in order to secure and manage their most
    valuable asset — information. We have taken a
    proactive and policy-driven approach to protecting and managing
    information as the tools and processes from these formerly
    discrete domains become more integrated.

The security market includes mission-critical products that
    protect consumers and enterprises from threats to electronic
    information, endpoint devices, and computer networks. Over the
    past year, we have seen a continued rise in the volume of
    security threats. Threats are continuing to grow more targeted
    with a focus on stealing confidential information for financial
    gain. Attackers are expanding their tactics to include targeting
    users with social-engineering attacks, such as phishing websites
    that steal financial information, passwords, and other personal
    data. The Internet has become the primary conduit for attack
    activity with hackers increasingly funneling threats through
    legitimate websites, placing a much larger percentage of the
    population at risk than in the past. Data losses are not
    realized solely from external attacks but are increasingly
    administered by malicious or well-meaning insiders. Security
    continues to be a top priority for enterprises as information
    security is increasingly relevant to corporate competitiveness,
    regulatory compliance, cloud computing, and the proliferation of
    mobile devices.

The storage software market includes products that manage,
    archive, backup, and recover business-critical data. Key drivers
    of demand in this market include the growth of information that
    organizations must manage, the need for data to be protected and
    accessible at all times, the transition from tape to disk-based
    backup, and the adoption of data deduplication technology. Other
    factors driving demand in this market include the pressure on
    companies to lower storage and server management costs without
    compromising performance and the need for a growing number of
    critical applications to be continuously available.



The systems management market includes products that control the
    IT environment by streamlining efforts associated with
    deploying, managing, patching, and remediating enterprise client
    and server assets. The drivers for demand in this market include
    customers’ desire to automate management and security
    remediation tasks, to ensure business productivity, and to
    reduce costs and complexity.

Business
    Developments and Highlights

During fiscal 2010, we took the following actions in support of
    our business:

•

We strengthened our leadership in security. We introduced our
    new reputation-based malware detection security technology in
    our 2010 Consumer products. This technology leverages data from
    our extensive Global Intelligence Network to derive safety
    ratings for files on the Internet, and allows us to establish
    the reputation of a program based on a number of different
    factors (including its origin, age, and prevalence). We also
    launched security products and suites designed specifically for
    the small and medium sized business (“SMB”) and
    enterprise markets. These products are easy to use and install,
    and provide easy to use enterprise-level protection that
    optimizes performance and offers simplified management
    capabilities and pre-configured settings.

•

We focused on the migration to next-generation information
    management. We integrated our backup, archiving and
    deduplication technologies and expanded our multi-platform
    support for physical and virtual environments. We released
    updated backup products that include expanded deduplication
    capabilities (at the client, media server, and via third party
    appliances), which products will allow customers to reduce the
    amount of data they store and the volume of data they transmit
    on their networks. We enhanced our products’ support for
    VMware and Microsoft Hyper-V virtualization technologies in
    order to allow customers to reduce management complexity and
    operational costs in their virtual environments. We introduced
    our new Data Insight technology to help customers identify their
    most critical information and give users access to data based on
    information intelligence and ownership.

•

We expanded our cloud based offerings. We extended the partner
    distribution network associated with our Symantec Hosted
    Services business, primarily in SaaS messaging and web security.
    We launched a new hosted medical image archiving and sharing
    solution for healthcare providers that is designed to help them
    lower image storage costs and provide secure, web-based image
    sharing. In addition, we developed a scalable file server
    solution that combines our file system and clustering
    technologies, and integrates our security and backup software in
    order to deliver an optimized infrastructure for public or
    private storage clouds. We also expanded distribution of our
    consumer online backup solution through various channel partners.

•

We completed two acquisitions during fiscal 2010. We expanded
    our SaaS security leadership by acquiring SoftScan, a
    privately-held SaaS security company in the Nordic region. We
    also acquired privately-held Gideon Technologies, Inc., a
    company with a leading Security Content Automation Protocol
    (“SCAP”) validated configuration and vulnerability
    assessment solution to enhance our ability to serve the needs of
    public sector customers.

•

We reduced our cost structure in order to improve operational
    efficiencies across our business. Some of the actions included:
    carefully managing our headcount costs; outsourcing certain back
    office functions; consolidating facilities; relocating certain
    research and development functions to lower cost locations; and
    reducing travel and entertainment expenses and other
    discretionary expenses. Offsetting these cost reductions were
    investments in our new Symantec-developed and operated consumer
    eCommerce platform, increased investments in certain consumer
    OEM distribution agreements and acquisition related expenses.

•

We launched a global eCommerce platform which allows us to host
    and manage consumer online stores. This is a strategic move,
    consistent with our ongoing focus on eCommerce and SaaS, in
    support of our consumer business. The benefits of managing an
    in-house eCommerce capability include building a closer
    relationship with our customers and enabling greater speed and
    agility to take advantage of market trends.

•

We repurchased 34 million shares of our common stock for an
    aggregate amount of $553 million.



Operating
    Segments and Products

Our operating segments are significant strategic business units
    that offer different products and services, distinguished by
    customer needs. During fiscal 2010, we had five operating
    segments: Consumer, Security and Compliance, Storage and Server
    Management, Services, and Other.

    backup offering serves 12 million customers and hosts over
    56 petabytes of consumers’ data.

We continue to acquire customers through a diversified channel
    strategy. In fiscal year 2010, Symantec introduced its own
    eCommerce platform to enhance customer’s

end-to-end

experience and capitalize on emerging market trends. We retain
    and leverage our strong existing customer base through
    auto-renewal subscriptions, migrating customers from point
    products to multi-product suites, and cross-selling additional
    products or services.

Security
    and Compliance

Our Security and Compliance segment helps our customers
    standardize, automate, and reduce the costs of

day-to-day

security activities in order to secure and manage their
    information. We have focused on offering security suite
    solutions that tie together multiple layers of protection and
    simplified management. Our primary solutions in this segment
    address the following areas:

Enterprise
    Security

Enterprise Security customer demand is driven by the evolving
    threat environment, the adoption of a content-aware approach to
    information protection, and the need to implement and ensure
    regulatory compliance. Our Symantec Protection Suite creates a
    protected endpoint, messaging, and Web environment that is
    secure against today’s complex malware, data loss and spam
    threats, and recovers endpoint data in the event of failure. Our
    Symantec Data Loss Prevention Suite helps companies understand
    where important information resides and helps ensure the
    appropriate access and movement of information into and out of
    the company. Our Symantec Control Compliance Suite allows
    businesses to prioritize risks, define and assess global IT
    policies, and remediate identified deficiencies.

Systems
    Management

Demand for Systems Management is driven by the need for
    automated asset management, patch management, and remediation
    solutions that offer better visibility into IT assets and
    simplify

day-to-day

operational management. Our solutions help companies realize
    value from their existing IT investments. Our Altiris IT
    Management Suite provides client, server and asset management
    with full service desk and automation capabilities that reduce
    IT costs and enhance IT effectiveness.

SaaS

Symantec Hosted Services, our SaaS offerings, enable customers
    to increase their messaging and web protection by blocking
    email, web and IM threats before they reach the network. Our
    SaaS security solutions



simplify global management through use of a central portal. Our
    SaaS offerings provide our customers the flexibility to manage
    their business using hosted services or through a mix of onsite
    and hosted solutions. Products include: MessageLabs Hosted
    Email, Web and Instant Messaging Security.

Storage
    and Server Management

Our Storage and Server Management segment focuses on providing
    enterprise customers with storage management, high availability,
    and backup and archiving solutions across heterogeneous storage
    and server platforms. These solutions enable companies to
    standardize on a single layer of infrastructure software that
    works on every major distributed operating system and supports
    every major storage device, database, and application in both
    physical and virtual environments. Our primary storage and
    server management solutions address the following areas:

Information
    Management

Our Information Management business, which includes backup and
    archiving, is driven by the rapid growth of information, data
    duplication, virtual environments, management inefficiencies,
    and legal

e-discovery

needs. Symantec helps organizations protect themselves by
    bringing together archiving, deduplication, and backup
    functionality into a fully integrated solution. Symantec helps
    customers back up information and deduplicate closer to
    information sources in order to reduce storage consumption as
    well as archive and enable a compliant and litigation-ready
    information infrastructure. Products include:
    NetBackup

tm

,

    NetBackup
    PureDisk

tm

,

    Backup
    Exec

tm

and Enterprise
    Vault

tm

.

Storage
    Management and High Availability

Our Storage Management and High Availability business is driven
    by our customers’ need to reduce overall storage costs
    through improved utilization of existing systems,
    virtualization, and cloud infrastructure offerings. The decline
    in server sales put pressure on this business, particularly with
    respect to new license sales on the Solaris platform. Our
    products help customers simplify their data centers by
    standardizing storage management across their environment for
    more efficient use of their existing storage investment. In
    addition, these products help customers build scalable,
    high-performance file-based storage systems for their
    enterprise, including private and public clouds. They also
    enable enterprises to manage large storage environments and
    ensure the availability of critical applications. Products
    include: Veritas Storage
    Foundation

,

    Veritas Cluster
    Server

tm

    and Symantec
    FileStore

tm

.

Services

Symantec Global Services help customers address information
    security, availability, storage, and compliance challenges at
    the endpoint and in complex, multi-vendor data center
    environments. Our Services segment delivers consulting,
    education, business critical, and managed services that help our
    customers maximize the value of their investment in our products
    and solutions.

    resource-intensive IT operations under the management of
    experienced Symantec specialists in order to optimize existing
    resources and focus on strategic IT projects. This helps
    customers by reducing IT complexity, managing IT risk, and
    lowering the cost of operations. These



services include: Managed Security Services, Managed Endpoint
    Protection Services and Managed Backup Services.

Sales and

Go-To-Market

Strategy

Consumer

We sell our consumer products and services to individuals and
    home offices globally through a network of distribution partners
    and eCommerce channels. Our products are available to customers
    through retailers, distributors, direct marketers,
    Internet-based resellers, system builders, and ISPs. We have
    partnerships with nine of the top 10 OEMs globally to distribute
    our securities suites and with six of the top 10 OEMs globally
    to distribute our online backup product. We broadened our
    presence in retail stores, with our products now carried in more
    than 30,000 locations worldwide.

Sales in the Consumer business through our electronic
    distribution channel, which includes sales derived from OEMs,
    subscriptions, upgrades, online sales, and renewals, represented
    approximately 80 percent of revenue in the Consumer segment
    in fiscal 2010. Products are also available through our new
    global in-house eCommerce stores, which improves our ability to
    identify and capitalize on emerging customer needs and market
    trends as well as enhance the

end-to-end

customer experience.

Enterprise

We sell and market our products and related services to
    enterprise customers through our direct sales force of more than
    3,500 sales representatives and through a variety of indirect
    sales channels, which include value-added resellers, large
    account resellers, and system integrators. We also sell our
    products in more than 40 countries through authorized
    distributors and OEMs who incorporate our technologies into
    their products, bundle our products with their offerings, or
    serve as authorized resellers of our products. Symantec has more
    than 40,000 distribution partners in its partner program
    worldwide. Our sales efforts are primarily targeted to senior
    executives and IT department personnel responsible for managing
    a company’s IT initiatives.

Marketing
    and Advertising

Our marketing expenditures relate primarily to advertising and
    promotion, which includes demand generation and brand
    recognition of our consumer and enterprise products. Our
    advertising and promotion efforts include, but are not limited
    to, electronic and print advertising, trade shows, collateral
    production, and all forms of direct marketing. We also invest in
    cooperative marketing campaigns with distributors, resellers,
    retailers, OEMs, and industry partners.

We invest in various retention marketing and customer loyalty
    programs to help drive renewals and encourage customer advocacy
    and referrals. We also provide focused vertical marketing
    programs in targeted industries and countries.



We typically offer two types of rebate programs within most
    countries: volume incentive rebates to channel partners and
    promotional rebates to distributors and end users. Distributors
    and resellers earn volume incentive rebates primarily based upon
    product sales to end users. We also offer rebates to individual
    users who purchase products through various resale channels.
    Both volume incentive rebates and end-user rebates are accrued
    as an offset to revenue.

Research
    and Development

Symantec embraces a global research and development
    (“R&D”) strategy to drive organic innovation
    across the company. Engineers throughout the company pursue
    advanced projects and work with our engineering centers,
    research labs and global services teams to translate R&D
    into next-generation technologies and integrate our unique set
    of technology assets across the portfolio. Symantec focuses on
    short, medium, and long-term applied research, develops new
    products in emerging areas, participates in government-funded
    research projects, and partners with universities to conduct
    research to support Symantec’s strategy. Symantec holds
    more than 900 patents.

Symantec’s Security Technology and Response organization is
    a global team of security engineers, threat analysts, and
    researchers that provides the underlying functionality, content,
    and support for all Symantec enterprise, SMB and consumer
    security products. Symantec’s security experts monitor
    malicious code reports collected through the Global Intelligence
    Network to provide insight into emerging attacks, malicious code
    activity, phishing, spam, and other threats. The team uses this
    vast intelligence to develop new technologies and approaches,
    such as Symantec’s reputation-based security technology, to
    protect customer’s information.

Research and development expenses, exclusive of in-process
    research and development associated with acquisitions, were
    $857 million, $870 million and $895 million in
    fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, representing
    approximately 14%, 14% and 15% of revenue in the respective
    periods. We believe that technical leadership is essential to
    our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial
    resources to research and development.

Support

Symantec has centralized support facilities throughout the world
    that provide rapid,

around-the-clock

response, and are staffed by technical product experts
    knowledgeable in the operating environments in which our
    products are deployed. Our technical support experts assist
    customers with product implementation and usage, issue
    resolution and countermeasures, and threat detection.

Symantec provides customers various levels of enterprise support
    offerings. Our enterprise security support program offers annual
    maintenance support contracts, including content, upgrades, and
    technical support. Our standard technical support includes:
    unlimited hotline service delivered by telephone, fax, email,
    and over the Internet; immediate patches for severe problems;
    periodic software updates; and access to our technical knowledge
    base and frequently asked questions.

Our consumer product support program provides self-help online
    services, phone, chat, email support, and fee-based premium
    support and diagnostic services to consumers worldwide.
    Customers that subscribe to LiveUpdate receive automatic
    downloads of the latest virus definitions, application bug
    fixes, and patches for most of our consumer products.

Customers

In fiscal 2010 and 2008, one distributor, Ingram Micro accounted
    for 10% of our total net revenue in both periods. In fiscal
    2009, Ingram Micro did not account for 10% of total net revenue.
    Our distributor arrangements with Ingram Micro consist of
    several non-exclusive, independently negotiated agreements with
    its subsidiaries, each of which cover different countries or
    regions. Each of these agreements is separately negotiated and
    is independent of any other contract (such as a master
    distribution agreement), and these agreements are not based on
    the same form of contract. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, one
    reseller, Digital River accounted for 10% and 11% of our total
    net revenues, respectively. In fiscal 2010, we launched a new,
    internally-developed eCommerce platform which will reduce our
    reliance on Digital River.



Acquisitions

Our acquisitions are designed to enhance the features and
    functionality of our existing products and extend our product
    leadership in core markets. We consider time to market,
    synergies with existing products, and potential market share
    gains when evaluating the economics of acquisitions of
    technologies, product lines, or companies. We may acquire

and/or

dispose of other technologies, products and companies in the
    future.

During fiscal 2010, we completed the following acquisitions:

For further discussion of our acquisitions, see Note 4 of
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual
    report.

Competition

Our markets are consolidating, highly competitive, and subject
    to rapid changes in technology. We are focused on integrating
    across the product portfolio and include next-generation
    technology capabilities into our solution set in order to
    differentiate ourselves from the competition. We believe that
    the principal competitive factors necessary to be successful in
    our industry include time to market, price, reputation,
    financial stability, breadth of product offerings, customer
    support, brand recognition, and effective sales and marketing
    efforts.

In addition to the competition we face from direct competitors,
    we face indirect or potential competition from retailers,
    application providers, operating system providers, network
    equipment manufacturers, and other OEMs, who may provide various
    solutions and functions in their current and future products. We
    also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for
    the attention of customers at the retail level and in corporate
    accounts. In addition, we compete with other software companies,
    operating system providers, network equipment manufacturers and
    other OEMs to acquire technologies, products, or companies and
    to publish software developed by third parties. We also compete
    with other software companies in our effort to place our
    products on the computer equipment sold to consumers and
    enterprises by OEMs.

The competitive environments in which each segment operates are
    described below.

Consumer

Some of the channels in which our consumer products are offered
    are highly competitive. Our competitors are intensely focused on
    customer acquisition, which has led such competitors to offer
    their technology for free, engage in aggressive marketing, or
    enter into competitive partnerships. Our primary competitors in
    the Consumer segment are McAfee, Inc. (“McAfee”), and
    Trend Micro Inc. (“Trend Micro”). There are also
    several smaller regional security companies and freeware
    providers that we compete against primarily in the EMEA and APJ
    regions. For our consumer backup offerings, our primary
    competitors are Mozy, Inc., owned by EMC Corporation
    (“EMC”), and Carbonite, Inc.

Security
    and Compliance

In the security and management markets, we compete against many
    companies that offer competing products to our solutions. Our
    primary competitors in the security and management market are
    LANDesk Software, Inc., McAfee, Microsoft Corporation
    (“Microsoft”), and Trend Micro. There are also several
    smaller regional security companies that we compete against
    primarily in the EMEA and APJ regions.

In the SaaS security market our primary competitors are Google
    Inc.’s Postini Services and Microsoft.



Storage
    and Server Management

The markets for storage and backup are intensely competitive.
    Our primary competitors are CA, Inc., CommVault Systems, Inc.,
    EMC, Hewlett-Packard Company (“HP”), IBM Corp.
    (“IBM”), Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, Inc. (acquired
    by Oracle Corporation), and VMware, Inc.

Services

We believe that the principal competitive factors for our
    services segment include technical capability, customer
    responsiveness, and our ability to hire and retain talented and
    experienced services personnel. Our primary competitors in the
    services segment are EMC, HP, IBM, and regional specialized
    consulting firms. In the managed security services business, our
    primary competitors are IBM, and SecureWorks, Inc.

Intellectual
    Property

Protective
    Measures

We regard some of the features of our internal operations,
    software, and documentation as proprietary and rely on
    copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws,
    confidentiality procedures, contractual arrangements, and other
    measures to protect our proprietary information. Our
    intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that
    enables us to gain recognition for our products, services, and
    technology and enhance our competitive position.

As part of our confidentiality procedures, we generally enter
    into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, distributors,
    and corporate partners, and we enter into license agreements
    with respect to our software, documentation, and other
    proprietary information. These license agreements are generally
    non-transferable and have a perpetual term. We also educate our
    employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to
    protect our facilities, equipment, and networks.

Trademarks,
    Patents, Copyrights, and Licenses

Symantec and the Symantec logo are trademarks or registered
    trademarks in the U.S. and other countries. In addition to
    Symantec and the Symantec logo, we have used, registered,

and/or

applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks
    to help distinguish our products, technologies, and services
    from those of our competitors in the U.S. and foreign
    countries and jurisdictions. We enforce our trademark, service
    mark, and trade name rights in the U.S. and abroad. The
    duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to
    country, and in the U.S. we generally are able to maintain
    our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for
    as long as the trademarks are in use.

We have a number of U.S. and foreign issued patents and
    pending patent applications, including patents and rights to
    patent applications acquired through strategic transactions,
    which relate to various aspects of our products and technology.
    The duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the
    country of issuance and for the U.S. is typically
    17 years from the date of issuance of the patent or
    20 years from the date of filing of the patent application
    resulting in the patent, which we believe is adequate relative
    to the expected lives of our products.

Our products are protected under U.S. and international
    copyright laws and laws related to the protection of
    intellectual property and proprietary information. We take
    measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary
    rights notices, and we actively enforce such rights in the
    U.S. and abroad. However, these measures may not provide
    sufficient protection, and our intellectual property rights may
    be challenged. In addition, we license some intellectual
    property from third parties for use in our products, and
    generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed
    intellectual property rights. While we believe that our ability
    to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is
    important to our success, we also believe that our business as a
    whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent,
    trademark, license, or other intellectual property right.

Seasonality

As is typical for many large software companies, our business is
    seasonal. Software license and maintenance orders are generally
    higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our
    first and second fiscal quarters. A



significant decline in license and maintenance orders is typical
    in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to license
    and maintenance orders in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal
    year. In addition, we generally receive a higher volume of
    software license and maintenance orders in the last month of a
    quarter, with orders concentrated in the later part of that
    month. We believe that this seasonality primarily reflects
    customer spending patterns and budget cycles, as well as the
    impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel.
    Revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a
    lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized
    until an order is shipped or services are performed and other
    revenue recognition criteria are met, and because a significant
    portion of our in-period revenue is provided by the ratable
    recognition of our deferred revenue balance.

Employees

As of April 2, 2010, we employed more than
    17,400 people worldwide, approximately 47 percent of
    whom reside in the U.S. Approximately 6,200 employees
    work in sales and marketing; 5,600 in research and development;
    4,200 in support and services; and 1,400 in management and
    administration.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

A description of the risk factors associated with our business
    is set forth below. The list is not exhaustive and you should
    carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before
    investing in our common stock.

Adverse
    global economic events may harm our business, operating results
    and financial condition.

Adverse macroeconomic conditions could negatively affect our
    business, operating results or financial condition under a
    number of different scenarios. During challenging economic times
    and periods of high unemployment, current or potential customers
    may delay or forgo decisions to license new products or
    additional instances of existing products, upgrade their
    existing hardware or operating environments (which upgrades are
    often a catalyst for new purchases of our software), or purchase
    services. Customers may also have difficulties in obtaining the
    requisite third-party financing to complete the purchase of our
    products and services. An adverse macroeconomic environment
    could also subject us to increased credit risk should customers
    be unable to pay us, or delay paying us, for previously
    purchased products and services. Accordingly, reserves for
    doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may
    increase. In addition, weakness in the market for end users of
    our products could harm the cash flow of our distributors and
    resellers who could then delay paying their obligations to us or
    experience other financial difficulties. This would further
    increase our credit risk exposure and, potentially, cause delays
    in our recognition of revenue on sales to these customers.

In addition, financial institution difficulties may make it more
    difficult either to utilize our existing debt capacity or
    otherwise obtain financing for our operations, investing
    activities (including potential acquisitions) or financing
    activities. Specific economic trends, such as declines in the
    demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices, or
    softness in corporate information technology spending, could
    have an even more direct, and harmful, impact on our business.



Fluctuations
    in demand for our products and services are driven by many
    factors, and a decrease in demand for our products could
    adversely affect our financial results.

We are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and
    services due to a variety of factors, including general economic
    conditions, competition, product obsolescence, technological
    change, shifts in buying patterns, financial difficulties and
    budget constraints of our current and potential customers,
    levels of broadband usage, awareness of security threats to IT
    systems, and other factors. While such factors may, in some
    periods, increase product sales, fluctuations in demand can also
    negatively impact our product sales. If demand for our products
    declines because of general economic conditions or for other
    reasons, our revenues and gross margin could be adversely
    affected.

If we
    are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services
    that achieve widespread market acceptance, or if we are unable
    to continually improve the performance, features, and
    reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our
    business model to keep pace with industry trends, our business
    and operating results could be adversely affected.

Our future success depends on our ability to respond to the
    rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or
    introducing new products, product upgrades, and services on a
    timely basis. We have in the past incurred, and will continue to
    incur, significant research and development expenses as we
    strive to remain competitive. New product development and
    introduction involves a significant commitment of time and
    resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges
    including:

•

Managing the length of the development cycle for new products
    and product enhancements, which has frequently been longer than
    we originally expected

•

Adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to
    technological developments by our competitors and customers

•

Extending the operation of our products and services to new and
    evolving platforms, operating systems and hardware products,
    such as netbooks

•

Entering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited
    experience

•

Managing new product and service strategies, including
    integrating our various security and storage technologies,
    management solutions, customer service, and support into unified
    enterprise security and storage solutions

•

Incorporating acquired products and technologies

•

Addressing trade compliance issues affecting our ability to ship
    new or acquired products

•

Developing or expanding efficient sales channels

•

Obtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access
    from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to
    enable the development and deployment of interoperable products,
    including source code licenses for certain products with deep
    technical integration into operating systems

In addition, if we cannot adapt our business models to keep pace
    with industry trends, our revenue could be negatively impacted.
    In connection with our enterprise software offerings, we license
    our applications on a variety of bases, such as per server, per
    processor, or based on performance criteria such as per amount
    of data processed or stored. If enterprises continue to migrate
    towards solutions, such as virtualization, which allow
    enterprises to run multiple applications and operating systems
    on a single server and thereby reduce the number of servers they
    are required to own and operate, we may experience lower license
    revenues unless we are able to successfully change our
    enterprise licensing model or sell additional software to take
    into account the impact of these new solutions.

If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges,
    or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not
    technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance,
    our business and operating results could be adversely affected.



We
    operate in a highly competitive environment, and our competitors
    may gain market share in the markets for our products that could
    adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to
    decline.

We operate in intensely competitive markets that experience
    rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards,
    changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product
    introductions and improvements. If we are unable to anticipate
    or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new
    competitors gain market share in any of our markets, our
    competitive position could weaken and we could experience a drop
    in revenue that could adversely affect our business and
    operating results. To compete successfully, we must maintain a
    successful research and development effort to develop new
    products and services and enhance existing products and
    services, effectively adapt to changes in the technology or
    product rights held by our competitors, appropriately respond to
    competitive strategies, and effectively adapt to technological
    changes and changes in the ways that our information is
    accessed, used, and stored within our enterprise and consumer
    markets. If we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors
    or to changing technological and customer demands, we could
    experience a negative effect on our competitive position and our
    financial results.

Our traditional competitors include independent software vendors
    that offer software products that directly compete with our
    product offerings. In addition to competing with these vendors
    directly for sales to end-users of our products, we compete with
    them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the
    product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer
    hardware OEMs and ISPs. Our competitors could gain market share
    from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products
    with the products of our competitors or if they more actively
    promote our competitors’ products than our products. In
    addition, software vendors who have bundled our products with
    theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or
    other vendors’ software or may limit our access to standard
    product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products
    for their platform.

We face growing competition from network equipment and computer
    hardware manufacturers and large operating system providers.
    These firms are increasingly developing and incorporating into
    their products data protection and storage and server management
    software that competes at some levels with our product
    offerings. Our competitive position could be adversely affected
    to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality
    incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our
    products.

Security protection is also offered by some of our competitors
    at prices lower than our prices or, in some cases is bundled for
    free. Some companies offer the lower-priced or free security
    products within their computer hardware or software products
    that are inferior to our products. Our competitive position
    could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers
    perceive these security products as replacing the need for more
    effective, full featured products such as those that we provide.
    The expansion of these competitive trends could have a
    significant negative impact on our sales and financial results.

Another growing industry trend is the SaaS business model, where
    software vendors develop and host their applications for use by
    customers over the Internet. This allows enterprises to obtain
    the benefits of commercially licensed, internally operated
    software without the associated complexity or high initial

set-up

and
    operational costs. Advances in the SaaS business model could
    enable the growth of our competitors and could affect the
    success of our traditional software licensing models. We are
    offering our own SaaS offerings, including those related to our
    fiscal 2009 acquisition of Message Labs, and we continue to
    incorporate these offerings into our licensing model. However,
    we may not be able to successfully incorporate our SaaS
    offerings into our current licensing models. Our inability to
    successfully develop and market new and existing SaaS product
    offerings could cause us to lose business to competitors.

Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical,
    sales, marketing, or other resources than we do and consequently
    may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their
    products instead of ours. We also face competition from many
    smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the
    markets in which we compete.



If we
    fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively
    or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to
    their customers, our operating results could be adversely
    affected.

We sell our products to customers around the world through
    multi-tiered sales and distribution networks. Sales through
    these different channels involve distinct risks, including the
    following:

Direct Sales.

A significant portion of our
    revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our
    direct sales force to end-users. Special risks associated with
    this sales channel include:

•

Longer sales cycles associated with direct sales efforts

•

Difficulty in hiring, retaining, and motivating our direct sales
    force

•

Substantial amounts of training for sales representatives to
    become productive, including regular updates to cover new and
    revised products

Indirect Sales Channels.

A significant portion
    of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels,
    including distributors that sell our products to end-users and
    other resellers. This channel involves a number of risks,
    including:

•

Our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products
    to end-users

•

Our resellers and distributors are not subject to minimum sales
    requirements or any obligation to market our products to their
    customers

•

Our reseller and distributor agreements are generally
    nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause

•

Our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute
    competing products and may, from time to time, place greater
    emphasis on the sale of these products due to pricing,
    promotions, and other terms offered by our competitors

•

Recent consolidation of electronics retailers has increased
    their negotiating power with respect to hardware and software
    providers

OEM Sales Channels.

A significant portion of
    our revenues is derived from sales through our OEM partners that
    incorporate our products into, or bundle our products with,
    their products. Our reliance on this sales channel involves many
    risks, including:

•

Our lack of control over the shipping dates or volume of systems
    shipped

•

Our OEM partners are generally not subject to minimum sales
    requirements or any obligation to market our products to their
    customers

•

Our OEM partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements
    with us and new terms may be less favorable due, among other
    things, to an increasingly competitive relationship with certain
    partners

•

Sales through our OEM partners are subject to changes in general
    economic conditions, strategic direction, competitive risks, and
    other issues that could result in a reduction of OEM sales

•

The development work that we must generally undertake under our
    agreements with our OEM partners may require us to invest
    significant resources and incur significant costs with little or
    no associated revenues

•

The time and expense required for the sales and marketing
    organizations of our OEM partners to become familiar with our
    products may make it more difficult to introduce those products
    to the market

•

Our OEM partners may develop, market, and distribute their own
    products and market and distribute products of our competitors,
    which could reduce our sales

•

In many cases we must incur up-front costs to access the OEM
    channel, particularly in the consumer market, and we may not
    recoup those up-front costs if customers do not ultimately
    activate and purchase our products



If we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels
    successfully, these channels may conflict with one another or
    otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate, which could reduce
    our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our
    competitive position. Some of our distribution partners have
    experienced financial difficulties in the past, and if our
    partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of
    general economic conditions or for other reasons, these partners
    may delay paying their obligations to us and we may have reduced
    sales or increased bad debt expense that could adversely affect
    our operating results. In addition, reliance on multiple
    channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability
    in demand, which could increase the risk that we may be unable
    to plan effectively for the future, and could result in adverse
    operating results in future periods.

We
    have grown, and may continue to grow, through acquisitions that
    give rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect
    our future financial results.

We have in the past acquired, and we expect to acquire in the
    future, other businesses, business units, and technologies.
    Acquisitions can involve a number of special risks and
    challenges, including:

•

Complexity, time, and costs associated with the integration of
    acquired business operations, workforce, products, and
    technologies into our existing business, sales force, employee
    base, product lines, and technology

•

Diversion of management time and attention from our existing
    business and other business opportunities

•

Loss or termination of employees, including costs associated
    with the termination or replacement of those employees

•

Assumption of debt or other liabilities of the acquired
    business, including litigation related to the acquired business

•

The addition of acquisition-related debt as well as increased
    expenses and working capital requirements

•

Dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders

•

Increased costs and efforts in connection with compliance with
    Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

•

Substantial accounting charges for restructuring and related
    expenses, write-off of in-process research and development,
    impairment of goodwill, amortization of intangible assets, and
    stock-based compensation expense, such as the $7.4 billion
    goodwill write-down we recorded during fiscal 2009

Integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be
    a complex, time consuming, and expensive process, and can impact
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting.

If integration of our acquired businesses is not successful, we
    may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or
    suffer other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee.
    To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our
    technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and
    manage the personnel of the acquired operations. We also must
    effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired
    business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various
    interests, and may need to enter new markets in which we have no
    or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have
    stronger market positions.

Any of the foregoing, and other factors, could harm our ability
    to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired
    businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of
    acquisitions. In addition, because acquisitions of high
    technology companies are inherently risky, no assurance can be
    given that our previous or future acquisitions will be
    successful and will not adversely affect our business, operating
    results, or financial condition.

We
    have not historically maintained substantial levels of
    indebtedness, and our financial condition and results of
    operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively
    manage our liabilities.

In June 2006, we sold $2.1 billion in aggregate principal
    amount of convertible senior notes. As a result of the sale of
    the notes, we have a substantially greater amount of long-term
    debt than we maintained prior to that sale. In addition, we have
    entered into a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of
    $1 billion. As of April 2, 2010, we had no borrowings
    under our credit facility. From time to time in the future, we
    may also incur indebtedness in addition



to the amount available under our credit facility. Our
    maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect
    our flexibility to take advantage of certain corporate
    opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition
    and results of operations. Of our outstanding convertible notes,
    $1.1 billion matures and is repayable in June 2011 and the
    balance is due in June 2013. We may be required to use all or a
    substantial portion of our cash balance to repay these notes on
    maturity unless we can obtain new financing.

Our
    international operations involve risks that could increase our
    expenses, adversely affect our operating results, and require
    increased time and attention of our management.

We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers
    located outside of the U.S. and we have significant
    operations outside of the U.S., including engineering, sales,
    customer support, and production. We plan to expand our
    international operations, but such expansion is contingent upon
    the financial performance of our existing international
    operations as well as our identification of growth
    opportunities. Our international operations are subject to risks
    in addition to those faced by our domestic operations, including:

•

Potential loss of proprietary information due to
    misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our
    intellectual property rights than U.S. laws or may not be
    adequately enforced

•

Requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls,
    including trade and labor restrictions and related laws that
    reduce the flexibility of our business operations

•

Regulations or restrictions on the use, import, or export of
    encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the
    acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks
    for secure communications

•

Central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate
    cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in
    international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the
    U.S.

•

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability
    such as higher interest rates in the U.S. and inflation
    that could reduce our customers’ ability to obtain
    financing for software products or that could make our products
    more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in
    certain countries

•

Limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current
    levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest
    sufficiently in our international operations

•

Longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and
    difficulties in collecting accounts receivable

•

Difficulties in staffing, managing, and operating our
    international operations, including difficulties related to
    administering our stock plans in some foreign countries

•

Difficulties in coordinating the activities of our
    geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations

•

Seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in
    Europe and in other periods in other countries

•

Reduced sales due to the failure to obtain any required export
    approval of our technologies, particularly our encryption
    technologies

•

Costs and delays associated with developing software and
    providing support in multiple languages

•

Political unrest, war, or terrorism, particularly in areas in
    which we have facilities

A significant portion of our transactions outside of the
    U.S. are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly,
    our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to
    fluctuations in foreign currency rates. We expect to be affected
    by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future,
    especially if international sales continue to grow as a
    percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the
    United States continue to increase.

The level of corporate tax from sales to our

non-U.S. customers

is less than the level of tax from sales to our
    U.S. customers. This benefit is contingent upon existing
    tax regulations in the U.S. and in the countries in which
    our international operations are located. Future changes in
    domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect
    our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits.



Our
    products are complex and operate in a wide variety of computer
    configurations, which could result in errors or product
    failures.

Because we offer very complex products, undetected errors,
    failures, or bugs may occur, especially when products are first
    introduced or when new versions are released. Our products are
    often installed and used in large-scale computing environments
    with different operating systems, system management software,
    and equipment and networking configurations, which may cause
    errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected
    errors, failures, or bugs in our products. Our customers’
    computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety
    of standard and non-standard configurations that make
    pre-release testing for programming or compatibility errors very
    difficult and time-consuming. In addition, despite testing by us
    and others, errors, failures, or bugs may not be found in new
    products or releases until after commencement of commercial
    shipments. In the past, we have discovered software errors,
    failures, and bugs in certain of our product offerings after
    their introduction and, in some cases, may have experienced
    delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errors.

Errors, failures, or bugs in products released by us could
    result in negative publicity, damage to our brand, product
    returns, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products,
    loss of competitive position, or claims by customers or others.
    Many of our end-user customers use our products in applications
    that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater
    sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other,
    less critical, software products. In addition, if an actual or
    perceived breach of information integrity or availability occurs
    in one of our end-user customer’s systems, regardless of
    whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market
    perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed.
    Alleviating any of these problems could require significant
    expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause
    interruptions, delays, or cessation of our product licensing,
    which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and
    could adversely affect our operating results.

If we
    are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, lose key
    personnel, fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully,
    or fail to manage our employee base effectively, we may be
    unable to develop new and enhanced products and services,
    effectively manage or expand our business, or increase our
    revenues.

Our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and
    retain our key management, technical, sales, marketing, finance,
    and other critical personnel. Our officers and other key
    personnel are

employees-at-will,

and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them.
    Competition for people with the specific skills that we require
    is significant. In order to attract and retain personnel in a
    competitive marketplace, we believe that we must provide a
    competitive compensation package, including cash and
    equity-based compensation. The volatility in our stock price may
    from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or
    retain employees. In addition, we may be unable to obtain
    required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number
    of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation
    plans, and accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of
    employee stock options and other forms of equity-based
    compensation as compensation expense. As a result, we may decide
    to issue fewer equity-based incentives and may be impaired in
    our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. If we are
    unable to hire and retain qualified employees, or conversely, if
    we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels
    when required by market conditions, our business and operating
    results could be adversely affected.

From time to time, key personnel leave our company. While we
    strive to reduce the negative impact of such changes, the loss
    of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to
    our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of
    product releases, the successful implementation and completion
    of company initiatives, the effectiveness of our disclosure
    controls and procedures and our internal control over financial
    reporting, and the results of our operations. In addition,
    hiring, training, and successfully integrating replacement sales
    and other personnel could be time consuming, may cause
    additional disruptions to our operations, and may be
    unsuccessful, which could negatively impact future revenues.



From
    time to time we are a party to class action lawsuits, which
    often require significant management time and attention and
    result in significant legal expenses, and which could, if not
    determined favorably, negatively impact our business, financial
    condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

We have been named as a party to class action lawsuits, and we
    may be named in additional litigation. The expense of defending
    such litigation may be costly and divert management’s
    attention from the

day-to-day

operations of our business, which could adversely affect our
    business, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, an
    unfavorable outcome in such litigation could negatively impact
    our business, results of operations, and cash flows.

Third
    parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could
    cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from
    selling our products.

From time to time, we receive claims that we have infringed the
    intellectual property rights of others, including claims
    regarding patents, copyrights, and trademarks. In addition,
    former employers of our former, current, or future employees may
    assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to
    us the confidential or proprietary information of these former
    employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result
    in costly litigation and distract management from

day-to-day

operations. If we are not successful in defending such claims,
    we could be required to stop selling, delay shipments of, or
    redesign our products, pay monetary amounts as damages, enter
    into royalty or licensing arrangements, or satisfy
    indemnification obligations that we have with some of our
    customers. We cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing
    arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be
    available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

In addition, we license and use software from third parties in
    our business. These third party software licenses may not
    continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all,
    and may expose us to additional liability. This liability, or
    our inability to use any of this third party software, could
    result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business
    that could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

If we
    do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third
    parties from making unauthorized use of our products and
    technology, our financial results could be harmed.

Most of our software and underlying technology is proprietary.
    We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination
    of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through
    copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws. However,
    all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be
    challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. Third
    parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise
    obtain, use, distribute, and sell our proprietary information
    without authorization. Third parties may also develop similar or
    superior technology independently by designing around our
    patents. Our shrink-wrap license agreements are not signed by
    licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of
    some jurisdictions. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign
    countries do not offer the same level of protection of our
    proprietary rights as the laws of the U.S., and we may be
    subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries.
    The unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary
    information could result in reduced sales of our products. Any
    legal action to protect proprietary information that we may
    bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could
    adversely affect our ability to access software, operating
    system, and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor, or
    cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products
    to their customers. In addition, any legal action to protect
    proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in,
    alone or through our alliances with the Business Software
    Alliance (“BSA”), or the Software &
    Information Industry Association (“SIIA”), could be
    costly, may distract management from

day-to-day

operations, and may lead to additional claims against us, which
    could adversely affect our operating results.

Some
    of our products contain “open source” software, and
    any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these
    open source licenses could negatively affect our
    business.

Certain of our products are distributed with software licensed
    by its authors or other third parties under so-called “open
    source” licenses, which may include, by way of example, the
    GNU General Public License (“GPL”), GNU Lesser General
    Public License (“LGPL”), the Mozilla Public License,
    the BSD License, and the Apache



License. Some of these licenses contain requirements that we
    make available source code for modifications or derivative works
    we create based upon the open source software, and that we
    license such modifications or derivative works under the terms
    of a particular open source license or other license granting
    third parties certain rights of further use. By the terms of
    certain open source licenses, we could be required to release
    the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our
    proprietary software with open source software in a certain
    manner. In addition to risks related to license requirements,
    usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use
    of third party commercial software, as open source licensors
    generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the
    software. We have established processes to help alleviate these
    risks, including a review process for screening requests from
    our development organizations for the use of open source, but we
    cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval
    prior to use in our products. In addition, many of the risks
    associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated, and
    could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business.

Our
    software products and website may be subject to intentional
    disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future
    sales.

Although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to
    prevent intentional disruptions, we expect to be an ongoing
    target of attacks specifically designed to impede the
    performance of our products and harm our reputation as a
    company. Similarly, experienced computer programmers may attempt
    to penetrate our network security or the security of our website
    and misappropriate proprietary information

and/or

cause
    interruptions of our services. Because the techniques used by
    such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change
    frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a
    target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. The
    theft

and/or

unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other
    confidential business information as a result of such an event
    could adversely affect our competitive position, reputation,
    brand and future sales of our products, and our customers may
    assert claims against us related to resulting losses of
    confidential or proprietary information. Our business could be
    subject to significant disruption, and we could suffer monetary
    and other losses and reputational harm, in the event of such
    incidents and claims.

Increased
    customer demands on our technical support services may adversely
    affect our relationships with our customers and our financial
    results.

We offer technical support services with many of our products.
    We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate
    short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We
    also may be unable to modify the format of our support services
    to compete with changes in support services provided by
    competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers.
    Further customer demand for these services, without
    corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely
    affect our operating results.

We have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide
    consumer support functions to third party service providers. If
    these companies experience financial difficulties, do not
    maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy
    our contracts, or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient
    level under these contracts, the level of support services to
    our customers may be significantly disrupted, which could
    materially harm our relationships with these customers.

Accounting
    charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial
    results.

Our financial results have been in the past, and may continue to
    be in the future, materially affected by non-cash and other
    accounting charges, including:

•

Amortization of intangible assets, including acquired product
    rights

•

Impairment of goodwill

•

Stock-based compensation expense

•

Restructuring charges

•

Impairment of long-lived assets

•

Loss on sale of a business and similar write-downs of assets
    held for sale



For example, during fiscal 2009, we recorded a non-cash goodwill
    impairment charge of $7.4 billion, resulting in a
    significant net loss for the year. Goodwill is evaluated
    annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal
    year or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant as
    we determined they did in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, and
    our evaluation depends to a large degree on estimates and
    assumptions made by our management. Our assessment of any
    impairment of goodwill is based on a comparison of the fair
    value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of
    that reporting unit. Our determination of fair value relies on
    management’s assumptions of our future revenues, operating
    costs, and other relevant factors. If management’s
    estimates of future operating results change, or if there are
    changes to other key assumptions such as the discount rate
    applied to future operating results, the estimate of the fair
    value of our reporting units could change significantly, which
    could result in a goodwill impairment charge. In addition, we
    evaluate our other long-lived assets, including intangible
    assets whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate
    that the value of these assets might be impaired. If we
    determine that impairment has occurred, we could incur an
    impairment charge against the value of these assets.

The foregoing types of accounting charges may also be incurred
    in connection with or as a result of other business
    acquisitions. The price of our common stock could decline to the
    extent that our financial results are materially affected by the
    foregoing accounting charges.

Our
    effective tax rate may increase, which could increase our income
    tax expense and reduce (increase) our net income
    (loss).

Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several
    factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:

•

Changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income
    before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate
    that have differing statutory tax rates

•

Changing tax laws, regulations, and interpretations in multiple
    jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the requirements of
    certain tax rulings

•

The tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and
    restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between
    reporting periods

•

Tax assessments, or any related tax interest or penalties, could
    significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in
    which the settlements take place.

The price of our common stock could decline if our financial
    results are materially affected by an adverse change in our
    effective tax rate.

We report our results of operations based on our determinations
    of the amount of taxes owed in the various tax jurisdictions in
    which we operate. From time to time, we receive notices that a
    tax authority in a particular jurisdiction in which we are
    subject to taxes has determined that we owe a greater amount of
    tax than we have reported to such authority. We are regularly
    engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax
    authorities. We are engaged in disputes of this nature at this
    time. If the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of
    these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax
    provision we have recorded or reserved for, our operating
    results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely
    affected.

Fluctuations
    in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of
    our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in
    the future.

Our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and
    are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number
    of factors, many of which are outside of our control and which
    could adversely affect our operations and operating results. If
    our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future
    financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities
    analysts and investors, our stock price could be negatively
    affected. Any volatility in our quarterly financial results may
    make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or
    pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock. Our
    operating results for prior periods may not be effective
    predictors of our future performance.



Factors associated with our industry, the operation of our
    business, and the markets for our products may cause our
    quarterly financial results to fluctuate, including:

•

Reduced demand for any of our products

•

Entry of new competition into our markets

•

Competitive pricing pressure for one or more of our classes of
    products

•

Our ability to timely complete the release of new or enhanced
    versions of our products

•

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

•

The number, severity, and timing of threat outbreaks (e.g. worms
    and viruses)

•

Our resellers making a substantial portion of their purchases
    near the end of each quarter

•

Enterprise customers’ tendency to negotiate site licenses
    near the end of each quarter

•

Cancellation, deferral, or limitation of orders by customers

•

Movement in interest rates

•

The rate of adoption of new product technologies and new
    releases of operating systems

•

Weakness or uncertainty in general economic or industry
    conditions in any of the multiple markets in which we operate
    that could reduce customer demand and ability to pay for our
    products and services

•

Political and military instability, which could slow spending
    within our target markets, delay sales cycles, and otherwise
    adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and operate
    effectively

•

Budgetary constraints of customers, which are influenced by
    corporate earnings and government budget cycles and spending
    objectives

•

Disruptions in our business operations or target markets caused
    by, among other things, earthquakes, floods, or other natural
    disasters affecting our headquarters located in Silicon Valley,
    California, an area known for seismic activity, or our other
    locations worldwide

•

Acts of war or terrorism

•

Intentional disruptions by third parties

•

Health or similar issues, such as a pandemic

Any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of
    our common stock to fluctuate significantly.

Our
    stock price may be volatile in the future, and you could lose
    the value of your investment.

The market price of our common stock has experienced significant
    fluctuations in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the
    future, and as a result you could lose the value of your
    investment. The market price of our common stock may be affected
    by a number of factors, including:

•

Announcements of quarterly operating results and revenue and
    earnings forecasts by us that fail to meet or be consistent with
    our earlier projections or the expectations of our investors or
    securities analysts

•

Announcements by either our competitors or customers that fail
    to meet or be consistent with their earlier projections or the
    expectations of our investors or securities analysts

•

Rumors, announcements, or press articles regarding our
    competitors’ operations, management, organization,
    financial condition, or financial statements

•

Changes in revenue and earnings estimates by us, our investors,
    or securities analysts

•

Accounting charges, including charges relating to the impairment
    of goodwill

•

Announcements of planned acquisitions or dispositions by us or
    by our competitors



•

Announcements of new or planned products by us, our competitors,
    or our customers

•

Gain or loss of a significant customer

•

Inquiries by the SEC, NASDAQ, law enforcement, or other
    regulatory bodies

•

Acts of terrorism, the threat of war, and other crises or
    emergency situations

•

Economic slowdowns or the perception of an oncoming economic
    slowdown in any of the major markets in which we operate

The stock market in general, and the market prices of stocks of
    technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme
    price volatility that has adversely affected, and may continue
    to adversely affect, the market price of our common stock for
    reasons unrelated to our business or operating results.

We have had stock repurchase programs in the past and have
    repurchased shares on a quarterly basis since the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2004 under new and existing programs. Our current
    program was authorized by our Board of Directors on
    October 27, 2009 to repurchase up to $1 billion of our
    common stock. This program does not have an expiration date, and
    as of April 2, 2010, $747 million remained authorized
    for future repurchases. For information with regard to our stock
    repurchase programs, see Note 10 of the Notes to

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

OVERVIEW

Our
    Business

Symantec is a global provider of security, storage and systems
    management solutions that help businesses and consumers secure
    and manage their information. We provide customers worldwide
    with software and services that protect, manage and control
    information risks related to security, data protection, storage,
    compliance, and systems management. We help our customers manage
    cost, complexity and compliance by protecting their IT
    infrastructure as they seek to maximize value from their IT
    investments.

Fiscal
    Calendar

We have a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to
    March 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to fiscal
    years in this report relate to fiscal year and periods ended
    April 2, 2010, April 3, 2009 and March 28, 2008.
    Fiscal 2010 and 2008 each consisted of 52 weeks, while
    fiscal 2009 consisted of 53 weeks. Our 2011 fiscal year
    will consist of 52 weeks and will end on April 1, 2011.

Our
    Operating Segments

Our operating segments are significant strategic business units
    that offer different products and services, distinguished by
    customer needs. Since the March 2008 quarter, we have operated
    in five operating segments: Consumer, Security and Compliance,
    Storage and Server Management, Services, and Other. During the
    first quarter of fiscal 2010, we changed our reporting segments
    to better align to our operating structure, resulting in the
    Enterprise Vault products that were formerly included in the
    Security and Compliance segment being moved to the Storage and
    Server Management segment. Also, our SaaS offerings moved to
    either the Security and Compliance segment or the Storage and
    Server Management segment from the Services segment, based on
    the nature of the service delivered. As a result, the revenue
    contribution from our SaaS offering primarily benefited our
    Security and Compliance segment following the move. We revised
    the segment information for the prior year to conform to the new
    presentation. For further descriptions of our operating
    segments, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in this annual report. Our reportable
    segments are the same as our operating segments.

Financial
    Results and Trends

Revenue decreased for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The
    challenging economic environment resulted in corporate IT
    budgets being reduced and spending has slowed from previous
    levels. Smaller IT budgets have led some of our corporate
    customers to purchase smaller volumes of our products,
    particularly in the Storage and Server Management segment. In
    addition, our storage business within the Storage and Server
    Management segment has



been adversely affected for the last several quarters by the
    deceleration of demand in the server market. Additionally, we
    were also particularly affected by lower new license sales of
    our storage products on the Solaris platform. If the economic
    conditions affecting global markets continue or IT spending
    remains tight, we may continue to experience slower or negative
    revenue growth and our business and operating results might
    suffer. In light of these economic conditions, we will continue
    to align our cost structure with our revenue expectations.
    During fiscal 2010, we experienced significantly higher

year-over-year

OEM placement fee payments resulting from an increase in PC unit
    shipments on which our products were bundled. These increased
    payments had an adverse impact on our operating income and
    operating margins during the fiscal 2010 periods, particularly
    for our Consumer segment. We expect to see the revenue benefit
    from these increased placement fees in future periods.

We launched a new, internally-developed and operated eCommerce
    platform during fiscal 2010 that will replace the current online
    store for the company’s Norton-branded consumer products
    worldwide, excluding Japan. We believe this will improve our
    ability to identify and capitalize on emerging customer needs
    and market trends and enhance the

end-to-end

experience our customers have with us. We have been
    transitioning customers to the new online store in a phased
    approach. The new online store is gradually ramping up worldwide
    coverage and is expected to reach full capacity by June 30,
    2010. The development and roll-out of our new eCommerce platform
    adversely affected the operating margins for our Consumer
    segment during fiscal 2010.

The fees we have paid to Digital River have historically been
    recorded as an offset to revenue. As a result of bringing the
    eCommerce business in-house, our consumer revenue is expected to
    increase due to the elimination of this offset to revenue. We
    expect revenue to increase in the range of $80 to
    $100 million in fiscal 2011 from this change. Conversely,
    the cost of running our own eCommerce platform will be
    classified primarily in operating expenses with some amounts
    flowing through cost of revenue. Therefore, operating expenses
    and cost of goods sold will both rise by a corresponding amount
    in 2011 and we believe the net impact to earnings per share for
    2011 will be neutral. Over time, we expect our new eCommerce
    strategy to increase consumer operating margins. We expect to
    capture the differential between what we have traditionally paid
    Digital River and the ongoing cost of operating our own
    eCommerce platform.

Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar compared to foreign
    currencies favorably impacted our international revenue by
    approximately $14 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to
    fiscal 2009. Foreign currency fluctuations had relatively little
    overall impact on our international revenue growth for fiscal
    2009 compared to fiscal 2008. We are unable to predict the
    extent to which revenue in future periods will be impacted by
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If our level of
    international sales and expenses increase in the future, changes
    in foreign exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact
    on our revenue and operating results.

As discussed above under “Fiscal Calendar,” fiscal
    2010 and 2008 consisted of 52 weeks, whereas fiscal 2009
    consisted of 53 weeks. The extra week contributed to
    additional amortization of deferred revenue of approximately
    $75 million in fiscal 2009.

Our net income was $714 million for fiscal 2010 and was
    positively impacted by a decrease of $128 million in cost
    of revenue related to certain acquired product rights from our
    acquisition of Veritas becoming fully amortized during the first
    quarter of our fiscal 2010. Net income was also positively
    impacted by a $78.5 million tax benefit in the third
    quarter of fiscal 2010 resulting from the December 2009

Veritas v. Commissioner

U.S. Tax Court decision
    relating to the Veritas 2000 and 2001 tax years. In addition,
    net income for fiscal 2010 was positively impacted by
    $47 million of net gain from the liquidation of certain
    foreign legal entities.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and
    related notes included in this annual report in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States,
    requires us to make estimates, which include judgments and
    assumptions, that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and related disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates
    on historical experience and on various assumptions that we
    believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate
    our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly.
    Historically, our critical accounting estimates have not
    differed materially from actual results; however, actual results
    may differ from these estimates under different conditions. If



actual results differ from these estimates and other
    considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual
    report, the resulting changes could have a material adverse
    effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and in
    certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on
    liquidity and our financial condition.

A critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and
    assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the
    estimate is made. Different estimates that reasonably could have
    been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially
    impact the operating results or financial condition. We believe
    that the estimates described below represent our critical
    accounting estimates, as they have the greatest potential impact
    on our consolidated financial statements. See also Note 1
    of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
    in this annual report.

Revenue
    Recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software
    industry. We recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the
    requirements under the authoritative guidance on software
    revenue recognition, and any applicable amendments or
    modifications. Revenue recognition requirements in the software
    industry are very complex and require us to make many estimates.

For arrangements that include multiple elements, including
    perpetual software licenses and maintenance

and/or

services, packaged products with content updates, managed
    security services, and subscriptions, we allocate and defer
    revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific
    objective evidence (“VSOE”) of the fair value of the
    undelivered elements, and recognize the difference between the
    total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the
    undelivered items as revenue. Our deferred revenue consists
    primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product
    maintenance, consumer product content updates, and arrangements
    where VSOE does not exist, such as managed security services and
    subscriptions. Deferred revenue totaled approximately
    $3.2 billion as of April 2, 2010, of which
    $371 million was classified as Long-term deferred revenue
    in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. VSOE of each element is
    based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold
    separately. We determine fair value of the undelivered elements
    based on historical evidence of our stand-alone sales of these
    elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for
    the undelivered elements. When VSOE does not exist for
    undelivered items, the entire arrangement fee is recognized
    ratably over the performance period. Changes to the elements in
    a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those
    elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and
    increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could
    materially impact the amount recognized in the current period
    and deferred over time.

For arrangements that include both software and non-software
    elements that are within the scope of the newly adopted
    accounting standards, further described below under
    “Recently Adopted Authoritative Guidance”, we allocate
    revenue to the software deliverables as a group and non-software
    deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such
    circumstances, the new accounting principles establish a
    hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for
    allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) VSOE,
    (ii) third-party evidence of selling price
    (“TPE”) and (iii) best estimate of the selling
    price (“ESP”). When we are unable to establish selling
    price using VSOE or TPE, we use ESP to allocate the arrangement
    fees to the deliverables.

For our consumer products that include content updates, we
    recognize revenue and the associated cost of revenue ratably
    over the term of the subscription upon sell-through to
    end-users, as the subscription period commences on the date of
    sale to the end-user. We defer revenue and cost of revenue
    amounts for unsold product held by our distributors and
    resellers.

We expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate
    inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer
    demand, which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand
    based on recent buying trends. We ship product to our
    distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid
    purchase orders. Our distributors and resellers base the
    quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer
    demand, which may exceed the expected level of a four or six
    week supply. We offer limited rights of return if the inventory
    held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected
    level of a four or six week supply. We estimate future returns
    under these limited rights of return in accordance with the
    authoritative guidance on revenue recognition. We typically
    offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our
    distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level. Because



we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory
    that will be returned, we primarily offset deferred revenue
    against trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in
    excess of the expected inventory levels.

Arrangements for managed security services and SaaS offerings
    are generally offered to our customers over a specified period
    of time, and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the
    maintenance, subscription, or service period.

Reserves for product returns.

We reserve for
    estimated product returns as an offset to revenue based
    primarily on historical trends. We fully reserve for obsolete
    products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred
    revenue. If we made different estimates, material differences
    could result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for
    any period presented. More or less product may be returned than
    what was estimated

and/or

the
    amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what
    was estimated. These factors and unanticipated changes in the
    economic and industry environment could make actual results
    differ from our return estimates.

Reserves for rebates.

We estimate and record
    reserves for channel and end-user rebates as an offset to
    revenue. For consumer products that include content updates,
    rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the
    term of the subscription. Our estimated reserves for channel
    volume incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and
    resellers’ actual performance against the terms and
    conditions of volume incentive rebate programs, which are
    typically entered into quarterly. Our reserves for end-user
    rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the
    promotional programs, actual sales during the promotion, amount
    of actual redemptions received, historical redemption trends by
    product and by type of promotional program, and the value of the
    rebate. We also consider current market conditions and economic
    trends when estimating our reserves for rebates. If actual
    redemptions differ from our estimates, material differences may
    result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any
    period presented.

Valuation
    of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived
    assets

When we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to
    tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible
    assets acquired. Any residual purchase price is recorded as
    goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires
    management to make significant estimates in determining the fair
    values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially
    with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based on
    information obtained from management of the acquired companies
    and historical experience. These estimates can include, but are
    not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to
    generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of
    capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from
    acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and
    unpredictable, and if different estimates were used the purchase
    price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired
    assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we
    have made. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances
    may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such
    estimates, and if such events occur we may be required to record
    a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an
    increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities.

Goodwill.

We review goodwill for impairment on
    an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter of each
    fiscal year, and on an interim basis whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable, at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units
    are consistent with our operating segments. Before performing
    the goodwill impairment test, we first assess the value of
    long-lived assets in each reporting unit, including tangible and
    intangible assets. We then perform a two-step impairment test on
    goodwill. In the first step, we compare the estimated fair value
    of equity of each reporting unit to its allocated carrying value
    (book value) of equity. If the carrying value of the reporting
    unit exceeds the fair value of the equity associated with that
    unit, there is an indicator of impairment and we must perform
    the second step of the impairment test. This second step
    involves determining the implied fair value of that reporting
    unit’s goodwill in a manner similar to the purchase price
    allocation for an acquired business, using the reporting
    unit’s calculated fair value as an assumed purchase price.
    If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill
    exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an
    impairment loss equal to the excess.

The process of estimating the fair value and carrying value of
    our reporting units’ equity requires significant judgment
    at many points during the analysis. Many assets and liabilities,
    such as accounts receivable and property and equipment, are not
    specifically allocated to an individual reporting unit, and
    therefore, we apply judgment to



allocate the assets and liabilities, and this allocation affects
    the carrying value of the respective reporting units. Similarly,
    we use judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units
    based on relative fair values. The use of relative fair values
    has been necessary for certain reporting units due to changes in
    our operating structure in prior years. To determine a reporting
    unit’s fair value, we use the income approach under which
    we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the
    estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit. We evaluate
    the reasonableness of this approach with the market approach,
    which involves a review of the carrying value of our assets
    relative to our market capitalization and to the valuation of
    publicly traded companies operating in the same or similar lines
    of business.

Applying the income approach requires that we make a number of
    important estimates and assumptions. We estimate the future cash
    flows of each reporting unit based on historical and forecasted
    revenue and operating costs. This, in turn, involves further
    estimates, such as estimates of future revenue and expense
    growth rates and foreign exchange rates. In addition, we apply a
    discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose
    of the valuation. This discount rate is based on the estimated
    weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit and may
    change from year to year. For example, in our valuation process
    in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we used a lower discount
    rate than in the prior year due to stabilized risk associated
    with the global economic conditions. Changes in these key
    estimates and assumptions, or in other assumptions used in this
    process, could materially affect our impairment analysis for a
    given year.

As of April 2, 2010, our goodwill balance was
    $4.6 billion. Based on the impairment analysis performed on
    January 2, 2010, we determined that the fair value of each
    of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the unit
    by more than 20% of the carrying value. While discount rates are
    only one of several important estimates used in the analysis, we
    determined that an increase of one percentage point in the
    discount rate used for each respective reporting unit would not
    have resulted in an impairment indicator for any unit at the
    time of this analysis.

A number of factors, many of which we have no ability to
    control, could affect our financial condition, operating results
    and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ
    from the estimates and assumptions we employed. These factors
    include:

•

a prolonged global economic crisis;

•

a significant decrease in the demand for our products;

•

the inability to develop new and enhanced products and services
    in a timely manner;

•

a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business
    climate;

•

an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;

•

successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in
    our markets;

•

a loss of key personnel;

•

our determination to dispose of one or more of our reporting
    units;

•

the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group
    within a reporting unit; and

•

recognition of a goodwill impairment loss

We assess the impairment of
    identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that an asset group’s carrying
    amount may not be recoverable. In addition, for intangible
    assets with indefinite lives, we review such assets for
    impairment on an annual basis consistent with the timing of the
    annual evaluation for goodwill. An impairment loss would be
    recognized when the sum of the undiscounted estimated future
    cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group
    and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount.
    Such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between
    the carrying amount of the asset group and its fair value. Our
    cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted
    revenue, operating costs, and other relevant factors. If
    management’s estimates of future operating results change,
    or if there are changes to other assumptions, the estimate of
    the fair value of our identifiable intangible assets could
    change significantly. Such change could result in impairment
    charges in future periods, which could have a significant impact
    on our operating results and financial condition.



We record impairment charges on developed technology or acquired
    product rights when we determine that the net realizable value
    of the assets may not be recoverable. To determine the net
    realizable value of the assets, we use the estimated future
    gross revenue from each product. Our estimated future gross
    revenue of each product is based on company forecasts and is
    subject to change.

Long-Lived Assets (including Assets Held for
    Sale).

We assess long-lived assets to be held and
    used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value of the long-lived assets may
    not be recoverable. Based on the existence of one or more
    indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment of
    long-lived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow
    method using assumptions determined by management to be
    commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business
    model. Our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment
    based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject
    to many factors which could change and cause a material impact
    to our operating results or financial condition. We record
    impairment charges on long-lived assets held for sale when we
    determine that the carrying value of the long-lived assets may
    not be recoverable. In determining our fair value, we obtain and
    consider market value appraisal information from third-parties.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The assessment of fair value for our financial instruments is
    based on the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements
    which establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on three
    levels of inputs and requires an entity to maximize the use of
    observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
    when measuring fair value.

We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields,
    broker/dealer quotes and other similar data which are obtained
    from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices or other
    sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and
    liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input, to
    which we have not made any material adjustments, to make our
    assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of
    our investment portfolio, and we are ultimately responsible for
    the financial statements and underlying estimates. The fair
    value and inputs are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further
    validated by comparison to publicly available information and
    could be adjusted based on market indices or other information
    that management deems material to their estimate of fair value.

As of April 2, 2010, our financial instruments measured at
    fair value on a recurring basis included $2.4 billion of
    assets. Our cash equivalents primarily consist of money market
    funds, bank securities, and government securities and represent
    99% of our total financial instruments measured at fair value on
    a recurring basis.

As of April 2, 2010, $2.1 billion of investments were
    classified as Level 1, most of which represents investments
    in money market funds. These were classified as Level 1
    because their valuations were based on quoted prices for
    identical securities in active markets. Determining fair value
    for Level 1 instruments generally does not require
    significant management judgment.

As of April 2, 2010, $342 million of investments were
    classified as Level 2, of which $216 million and
    $116 million (representing a combined 97% of Level 2
    financial instruments) represent investments in bank securities
    and government securities, respectively. These were classified
    as Level 2 because either (1) the estimated fair value
    is based on the fair value of similar securities or
    (2) their valuations were based on pricing models with all
    significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable
    market prices for identical securities in markets with
    insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active
    markets). Level 2 inputs generally are based on non-binding
    market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable
    market data; quoted prices for similar instruments;

and/or

model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are
    observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated
    with observable market data for substantially the full term of
    the assets or liabilities or quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities. While determining the fair value for Level 2
    instruments does not necessarily require significant management
    judgment, it generally involves the following level of judgment
    and subjectivity:

•

Determining whether a market is considered active- An assessment
    of an active market for marketable securities generally takes
    into consideration whether a trading market exists for a given
    instrument or trading volume for each instrument type. Our
    Level 2 financial instruments were classified due to either
    low trading



activity in active markets or no active market existing. For
    those securities where no active market existed, amortized cost
    was used and approximates fair value because of their short
    maturities. For certain financial instruments classified as
    Level 2 as of April 2, 2010, we used identical
    securities for determining fair value.

•

Determining which model-derived valuations to use in determining
    fair value- When observable market prices for identical
    securities or similar securities are not available, we may price
    marketable securities using: non-binding market consensus prices
    that are corroborated with observable market data; or pricing
    models, such as discounted cash flow approaches, with all
    significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable
    market data. In addition, the credit ratings for issuers of debt
    instruments in which we are invested could change, which could
    lead to lower fair values. As of April 2, 2010, the fair
    value of $6 million of fixed-income securities was
    determined using benchmark pricing models for identical or
    similar securities.

As of April 2, 2010, we have no financial instruments with
    unobservable inputs classified in Level 3 under the
    hierarchy set forth under the authoritative guidance on fair
    value measurements. Level 3 instruments generally would
    include unobservable inputs to be used in the valuation
    methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair
    value of assets or liabilities. The determination of fair value
    for Level 3 instruments requires the most management
    judgment and subjectivity.

Stock-based
    Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the
    authoritative guidance on stock compensation. Under the fair
    value recognition provisions of this guidance, stock-based
    compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair
    value of the award and is recognized as expense over the
    requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period
    of the respective award.

Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant
    date requires judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing
    model to determine the fair value of stock options. The
    determination of the grant date fair value of options using an
    option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as
    assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective
    variables. These variables include our expected stock price
    volatility over the term of the options, actual and projected
    employee stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors,
    risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends.

We estimate the expected life of options granted based on an
    analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and
    post-vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the
    contractual life of the option. Expected volatility is based on
    the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate
    with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility
    of traded options. The risk free interest rate is equal to the
    U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal
    to the expected life. We do not currently pay cash dividends on
    our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the
    foreseeable future. Accordingly, our expected dividend yield is
    zero.

In accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock
    compensation, we only record stock-based compensation expense
    for awards that are expected to vest. As a result, judgment is
    also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards
    that are expected to be forfeited. Although we estimate
    forfeitures based on historical experience, actual forfeitures
    may differ. If actual results differ significantly from these
    estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of
    operations could be materially impacted when we record a

true-up

for
    the difference in the period that the awards vest.

Contingencies
    and Litigation

We evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or
    pending litigation in accordance with the authoritative guidance
    on contingencies. We assess the likelihood of any adverse
    judgments or outcomes from a potential claim or legal
    proceeding, as well as potential ranges of probable losses, when
    the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and
    reasonably estimable. A determination of the amount of accrued
    liabilities required, if any, for these contingencies is made
    after the analysis of each separate matter. Because of
    uncertainties related to these matters, we base our estimates on
    the information available at the time of our assessment. As
    additional information becomes available, we reassess the
    potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation
    and



may revise our estimates. Any revisions in the estimates of
    potential liabilities could have a material impact on our
    operating results and financial position.

Income
    Taxes

We are required to compute our income taxes in each federal,
    state, and international jurisdiction in which we operate. This
    process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as
    well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and
    tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as
    accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax
    purposes. The income tax effects of the differences we identify
    are classified as current or long-term deferred tax assets and
    liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our judgments,
    assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for
    income tax take into account current tax laws, our
    interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of
    current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax
    authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax
    laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could
    significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

We account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to authoritative
    guidance based on a two-step approach to recognize and measure
    uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax
    return. The first step is to determine if the weight of
    available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not
    that the tax position will be sustained on audit, including
    resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The
    second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount
    that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate
    settlement. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions
    due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of
    a tax audit, refinement of estimates, or realization of earnings
    or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that
    the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts
    recorded, such differences will impact our tax provision in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which
    such determination is made.

We must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will
    be realized from future taxable income and, based on this
    assessment establish a valuation allowance, if required. Our
    determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number
    of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including forecasted
    earnings, future taxable income, and the relative proportions of
    revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and
    international jurisdictions in which we operate. To the extent
    we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation
    allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a
    corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In July 2008, we reached an agreement with the IRS concerning
    our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made
    from a Veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the July 2005
    acquisition. The distribution was intended to be made pursuant
    to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and therefore
    eligible for a 5.25% effective U.S. federal rate of tax, in
    lieu of the 35% statutory rate. The final impact of this
    agreement is not yet known since this relates to the taxability
    of earnings that are otherwise the subject of the tax years

2000-2001

transfer pricing dispute which in turn is being addressed in the
    U.S. Tax Court. To the extent that we owe taxes as a result
    of the transfer pricing dispute, we anticipate that the
    incremental tax due from this negotiated agreement will
    decrease. We currently estimate that the most probable outcome
    from this negotiated agreement will be that we will owe
    $13 million or less, for which an accrual has already been
    made. We made a payment of $130 million to the IRS for this
    matter in May 2006. We applied $110 million of this payment
    as a deposit on the outstanding transfer pricing matter for the
    tax years

2000-2004.

Net revenue decreased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal
    2009, primarily due to a $336 million decrease in License
    revenue partially offset by a $171 million increase in
    Content, subscription, and maintenance revenue. The net decrease
    was primarily due to decreased license revenue from our Storage
    and Server Management segment as a result of the overall market
    weakness in server sales and tight IT spending due to the global
    economic slowdown and the uncertainty surrounding the
    acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Inc. by Oracle Corporation.
    This decrease was partially offset by strength in our Consumer
    segment and the items discussed above under “Financial
    Results and Trends.”

Net revenue increased for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal
    2008, primarily due to a $302 million increase in Content,
    subscription, and maintenance revenue. This increase was
    primarily related to increased revenue in our Storage and Server
    Management and Services segments and the items discussed above
    under “Financial Results and Trends.”

Content, subscription, and maintenance revenue increased for
    fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as a result of strength
    in our Consumer segment primarily due to increases in revenue
    from acquired security products and the gradual global ramp up
    of our eCommerce platform, as well as revenue from our fiscal
    2009 acquisitions of MessageLabs and PC Tools, and the items
    discussed above under “Financial Results and Trends.”

Content, subscription, and maintenance revenue increased for
    fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to an
    aggregate increase in content, subscription and maintenance
    revenue from the Storage and Server Management and Services
    segments of $237 million. The increase in these two
    segments’ revenue was largely attributable to demand for
    our Storage and Server Management products and consulting
    services as a result of increased demand for security and
    storage solutions. This increased demand was driven by the
    proliferation of structured and unstructured data and increasing
    sales of services in conjunction with our license sales. The
    increased demand was also a result of our focus on offering our
    customers a more comprehensive IT solution. Furthermore, growth
    in our customer base through acquisitions and new license sales
    resulted in an increase to Content, subscription, and
    maintenance revenue because a large number of our customers
    renew their annual maintenance contracts.

License revenue decreased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal
    2009, primarily due to the global economic slowdown and
    customers emphasizing purchases of smaller volumes of new
    licenses consistent with their near term needs during the
    periods presented, as well as for the items discussed above
    under “Financial Results and Trends.”

License revenue decreased slightly for fiscal 2009, as compared
    to fiscal 2008, primarily due to a decrease in revenue related
    to our Security and Compliance products, offset by an increase
    in revenue related to our Storage and Server Management
    products. The decreases in Security and Compliance license
    revenue was primarily a result of the challenging economic
    environment and a decline in demand from small and medium
    businesses. The offsetting increases in Storage and Server
    Management license revenue are a result of increased demand for
    storage solutions driven by the proliferation of structured and
    unstructured data.

Consumer revenue increased for fiscal 2010, as compared to
    fiscal 2009, primarily due to increases in revenue from acquired
    security products, our core consumer products in the electronic
    channel, and the items discussed above under “Financial
    Results and Trends.”

Our electronic channel sales are derived from OEMs,
    subscriptions, upgrades, online sales, and renewals. Electronic
    channel revenue has increased

year-over-year

since fiscal 2008. Electronic sales accounted for approximately
    81%, 78%, and 73% of Consumer revenue for fiscal 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively.

Operating income for the Consumer segment decreased for fiscal
    2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as expense growth outpaced
    revenue growth. Total expenses for the segment increased
    primarily as a result of the higher OEM placement fees and costs
    associated with our development and operation of our new
    proprietary eCommerce platform, both discussed above under
    “Financial Results and Trends.”

Consumer revenue increased for fiscal 2009, as compared to
    fiscal 2008, primarily due to an increase from our core consumer
    security products in our electronic channels, partially offset
    by a decrease in our retail channels. In addition, Consumer
    revenue increased from the sale of our consumer services and
    acquired security products.

Operating income for this segment increased for fiscal 2009, as
    compared to fiscal 2008, as the increase in revenue more than
    offset the increase in expenses. Total expenses for fiscal 2009
    increased primarily as a result of the PC Tools acquisition.

Operating income for the Security and Compliance segment
    increased for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, as
    expenses decreased while revenue growth remained relatively

Operating income for the Storage and Server Management segment
    increased for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as the
    decrease in expenses more than offset the decrease in revenue
    due to our ongoing focus on cost efficiency.

Storage and Server Management revenue increased for fiscal 2009,
    as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to increased sales of
    products related to storage management, data protection,
    disaster recovery and products supporting high availability. The
    demand for these products was driven by the increase in the
    proliferation of structured and unstructured data, as well as
    the increasing demand for optimization of storage systems.

Operating income for the Storage and Server Management segment
    increased for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, as the
    growth in revenue was coupled with a decrease in expenses. Total
    expenses for fiscal 2009 decreased partly as a result of fiscal
    2008 divestiture of a business.

Operating income for the Services segment increased for fiscal
    2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, as various cost control
    initiatives led to better margins.

Services revenue increased for fiscal 2009, as compared to
    fiscal 2008, primarily due to an increase in revenue in our
    consulting services and Business Critical Services, as a result
    of increased demand for more comprehensive software
    implementation assistance and increased demand for our Business
    Critical Services. Customers purchased our service offerings in
    conjunction with the purchase of our products and augmented the
    capabilities of their own IT staff with our onsite consultants.

The operating loss for the Services segment decreased for fiscal
    2009, as compared to fiscal 2008, as revenue growth exceeded
    expense growth for the segment. Our focus on margin improvement
    contributed to the decrease in operating loss.

Americas revenue decreased for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal
    2009 primarily due to decreased revenue related to our Storage
    and Server Management, Security and Compliance and Services
    segments, partially offset by increased revenue related to our
    Consumer segment.

EMEA revenue decreased for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal
    2009 primarily due to decreased revenue across all of our
    segments, particularly Storage and Server Management.

Asia Pacific Japan revenue increased for fiscal 2010 as compared
    to fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased revenue related to our
    Consumer and Security and Compliance segments, partially offset
    by decreased revenue in our Storage and Server Management
    segment.

Americas revenue increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal
    2008 primarily due to increased revenue related to our Storage
    and Server Management and Services segments. In addition, for
    fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, Americas revenue related
    to our Consumer segment increased driven by demand for our
    Consumer segment products suites.

EMEA revenue decreased slightly for fiscal 2009 as compared to
    fiscal 2008 primarily due to decreased revenue related to our
    Consumer and Security and Compliance segments as a result of a
    strengthening U.S. dollar and a decrease in endpoint
    security product sales to small and medium sized businesses.
    This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue
    related to our Storage and Server Management and Services
    segments.

Asia Pacific Japan revenue increased for fiscal 2009 as compared
    to fiscal 2008 primarily due to increased revenue related to our
    Storage and Server Management segment.

Our international sales are and will continue to be a
    significant portion of our net revenue. As a result, net revenue
    will continue to be affected by foreign currency exchange rates
    as compared to the U.S. dollar. We are



unable to predict the extent to which revenue in future periods
    will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
    If international sales become a greater portion of our total
    sales in the future, changes in foreign currency exchange rates
    may have a potentially greater impact on our revenue and
    operating results.

Acquired product rights are comprised of developed technologies
    and patents from acquired companies. The decrease in
    amortization for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, was
    primarily due to certain acquired product rights from our
    acquisition of Veritas becoming fully amortized during the first
    quarter of our fiscal 2010. This decrease was partially offset
    by additional amortization from product rights acquired from
    SwapDrive, PC Tools and MessageLabs during fiscal 2009.

The increase in amortization for fiscal 2009, as compared to
    fiscal 2008, was primarily due to amortization associated with
    our SwapDrive, PC Tools and MessageLabs acquisitions during
    fiscal 2009, offset in part by the APM business divestiture in
    fiscal 2008.

Operating
    Expenses

Operating
    expenses overview

As discussed above under “Financial Results and
    Trends,” our operating expenses for fiscal 2010 include
    52 weeks of activity as compared to 53 weeks for
    fiscal 2009, which had a favorable impact on the

year-over-year

comparison of our operating expenses. Our operating expenses for
    fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, were not materially
    impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates.

Our operating expenses for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal
    2008, increased as a result of an additional week during fiscal
    2009, which was partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar
    in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008.

Our operating expenses for Fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were
    favorably impacted by the restructuring plans discussed below.

Sales and marketing expense remained relatively flat during

    marketing expense reflects the impact of our prior year
    restructuring plan, partially offset by increases in headcount
    related expenses from our fiscal 2009 acquisitions and increases
    in Consumer OEM fees and costs associated with the development
    and operations of our new proprietary eCommerce platform. As a

The restructuring charges for fiscal 2010 primarily consisted of

    (“2010 Plan”) and 2008 Restructuring Plan (“2008
    Plan”), and transition and transformation costs related to
    the outsourcing of certain back office functions. The
    restructuring charges for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, primarily
    consisted of severance charges related to the 2008 Plan and
    prior plans and acquisition-related plans.

Total remaining severance charges are estimated to range from
    $50 million to $80 million, primarily for the 2010
    Plan. Total remaining facilities charges are estimated to range
    from $35 million to $45 million related to the 2010
    Plan. Total remaining costs for the transition and
    transformation activities associated with outsourcing back
    office functions are estimated to be approximately
    $10 million to $20 million. For further information on
    restructuring, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated

In accordance with the authoritative guidance on goodwill and
    other intangibles, we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least
    annually and any time business conditions indicate a potential
    change in recoverability. During the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2010, we performed our annual impairment analysis and determined
    that goodwill was not impaired. During the third quarter of
    fiscal 2009, we concluded that there were impairment indicators,
    including the challenging economic environment and a decline in
    our market capitalization, which required us to perform an
    interim goodwill impairment analysis. The analysis was not
    completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and an
    estimated impairment charge of $7.0 billion was recorded.
    The analysis was subsequently finalized and an additional
    impairment charge of $413 million was included in our
    results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. As a result, we
    incurred a total impairment charge of $7.4 billion for
    fiscal 2009. We also performed our annual impairment analysis
    during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and determined that no
    additional impairment charge was necessary.

For the purposes of this analysis, our estimates of fair value
    are based on a combination of the income approach, and the
    market approach. The income approach estimates the fair value of
    our reporting units based on the future discounted cash flows.
    We also consider the market approach, which estimates the fair
    value of our reporting units based on comparable market prices.

During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized impairments of
    $20 million, $46 million, and $93 million,
    respectively, on certain land and buildings classified as held
    for sale. The impairments were recorded in accordance with the
    authoritative guidance that requires a long-lived asset
    classified as held for sale to be measured at the lower of its
    carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. Also, in
    fiscal 2010 and 2008, we sold assets for $42 million and
    $98 million, which resulted in losses of $10 million
    and $2 million, respectively. We sold properties in fiscal
    2009 for $40 million with an immaterial loss.

The decrease in interest income during fiscal 2010, as compared
    to fiscal 2009, is due to a lower average yield on our invested
    cash and short-term investment balances. Interest expense for
    fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, remained relatively
    consistent. Other income, net for fiscal 2010 includes net gains
    of $47 million from the liquidation of certain foreign
    legal entities. The liquidations resulted in the release of
    cumulative translation adjustments from accumulated other
    comprehensive income related to these entities.



Interest income decreased during fiscal 2009 and 2008 primarily
    due to lower average cash balances outstanding and lower average
    yields on our invested cash and short-term investment balances.
    Interest expense for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2010,
    remained relatively consistent. Other income, net for fiscal
    2008 includes a net gain from settlements of litigation of
    approximately $59 million.

Effective tax rate on earnings


%

(3

)%


%

Our effective tax rate was approximately 13%, (3)% and 34% in
    fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

The tax expense in fiscal 2010 was significantly reduced by the
    following benefits recognized in the year:
    (1) $78.5 million tax benefit arising from the

Veritas v. Commissioner

Tax Court decision (see
    further discussion below), (2) $11 million tax benefit
    from the reduction of our valuation allowance for certain
    deferred tax assets, (3) $17 million tax benefit from
    lapses of statutes of limitation, (4) $9 million tax
    benefit from the conclusion of U.S. and foreign audits,
    (5) $7 million tax benefit to adjust taxes provided in
    prior periods, and (6) $6.5 million tax benefit from
    current year discrete events. The change in the valuation
    allowance follows discussions with Irish Revenue in the third
    quarter of fiscal 2010, the result of which accelerates the
    timing of the use of certain Irish tax loss carryforwards in the
    future. The tax expense in fiscal 2009 was materially impacted
    by the inclusion of a $56 million tax benefit associated
    with the $7.0 billion impairment of goodwill in the third
    quarter of fiscal 2009.

The effective tax rates for all periods presented otherwise
    reflects the benefits of lower-taxed foreign earnings and losses
    from our joint venture with Huawei (“joint venture”)
    (fiscal 2010 and 2009 only), domestic manufacturing incentives,
    and research and development credits, partially offset by state
    income taxes.

As a result of the impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2009, we
    have cumulative pre-tax book losses, as measured by the current
    and prior two years. We considered the negative evidence of this
    cumulative pre-tax book loss position on our ability to continue
    to recognize deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future
    taxable income for realization. Levels of future taxable income
    are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in
    Part I, Item 1A,

Risk Factors,

set forth in
    this annual report. We considered the following as positive
    evidence: the vast majority of the goodwill impairment is not
    deductible for tax purposes and thus will not result in tax
    losses; we have a strong, consistent taxpaying history; we have
    substantial U.S. federal income tax carryback potential;
    and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of
    taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities.
    We have concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the
    negative evidence and, thus, that the deferred tax assets as of
    April 2, 2010 of $519 million, after application of
    the valuation allowances, are realizable on a “more likely
    than not” basis.

On May 27, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    Ninth Circuit overturned a 2005 U.S. Tax Court ruling in

Xilinx v. Commissioner

, holding that stock-based
    compensation related R&D must be shared by the participants
    of a R&D cost sharing arrangement. The Ninth Circuit held
    that related parties to such an arrangement must share stock
    option costs, notwithstanding the U.S. Tax Court’s
    finding that unrelated parties in such an arrangement would not
    share such costs. Symantec has a similar R&D cost sharing
    arrangement in place. The Ninth Circuit’s reversal of the
    U.S. Tax Court’s decision changed our estimate of
    stock option related tax benefits previously recognized under
    the authoritative guidance on income taxes. As a result of the
    Ninth Circuit’s ruling, we increased our liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits, recording a tax expense of
    approximately $7 million and a reduction of additional
    paid-in capital of approximately $30 million in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2010. On January 13, 2010, the Ninth
    Circuit Court of Appeals withdrew its issued opinion. On
    March 22, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a
    revised decision affirming the decision of the Tax Court. The
    Ninth Circuit’s decision agreed with the Tax Court’s
    finding that related companies are not required to share such
    costs. As a result of the Ninth Circuit’s revised ruling,
    we released the liability established in our first quarter of
    fiscal 2010, which resulted in a $7 million tax benefit and
    increase of additional paid-in capital of approximately
    $30 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. For
    fiscal 2010, there was no net income tax expense impact.



On March 29, 2006, we received a Notice of Deficiency from
    the IRS claiming that we owe $867 million of additional
    taxes, excluding interest and penalties, for the 2000 and 2001
    tax years based on an audit of Veritas. On June 26, 2006,
    we filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court protesting the
    IRS claim for such additional taxes. During July 2008, we
    completed the trial phase of the Tax Court case, which dealt
    with the remaining issue covered in the assessment. At trial,
    the IRS changed its position with respect to this remaining
    issue, which decreased the remaining amount at issue from
    $832 million to $545 million, excluding interest. We
    filed our post-trial briefs in October 2008 and rebuttal briefs
    in November 2008 with the U.S. Tax Court.

On December 10, 2009, the U.S. Tax Court issued its
    opinion, finding that our transfer pricing methodology, with
    appropriate adjustments, was the best method for assessing the
    value of the transaction at issue between Veritas and its
    offshore subsidiary. The Tax Court judge provided guidance as to
    how adjustments would be made to correct the application of the
    method used by Veritas. We remeasured and decreased our
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits accordingly, resulting
    in a $78.5 million tax benefit in the third quarter of
    fiscal 2010. Final computations as directed by the Ruling are
    not complete and, accordingly, we may make further adjustments
    to our tax liability in the future. The Tax Court ruling is
    subject to appeal. We have $110 million on deposit with the
    IRS pertaining to this matter. We do not anticipate making any
    further federal tax payments for these years.

On December 2, 2009, we received a Revenue Agent’s
    Report from the IRS for the Veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years
    assessing additional taxes due. We agree with $30 million
    of the tax assessment, excluding interest, but will contest the
    other $80 million of tax assessed and all penalties. The
    unagreed issues concern transfer pricing matters comparable to
    the one that was resolved in our favor in the

Veritas v.
    Commissioner

Tax Court decision. On January 15, 2010 we
    filed a protest with the IRS in connection with the
    $80 million of tax assessed.

We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing tax controversies
    and the impact, if any, of the expected tolling of the statute
    of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.

On February 5, 2008, Symantec formed a joint venture with a
    subsidiary of Huawei Technologies Co., Limited
    (“Huawei”). The joint venture is domiciled in Hong
    Kong with principal operations in Chengdu, China. The joint
    venture develops, manufactures, markets and supports security
    and storage appliances for global telecommunications carriers
    and enterprise customers.

As described in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in this annual report, the joint venture
    adopted new authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with
    multiple deliverables during its period ended December 31,
    2009, which was applied to the beginning of its fiscal year. As
    a result of the joint venture’s adoption of the guidance,
    our net income was $12 million higher for fiscal 2010 than
    it would have been under the pre-existing accounting guidance.
    We account for our investment in the joint venture under the
    equity method of accounting. Under this method, we record our
    proportionate share of the joint venture’s net income or
    loss based on the quarterly financial statements of the joint
    venture. We record our proportionate share of net income or loss
    one quarter in arrears.

For fiscal 2010, we recorded a loss of approximately
    $39 million related to our share of the joint
    venture’s net loss incurred for the period from
    January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009. For fiscal 2009,
    we recorded a loss of approximately $53 million related to
    our share of the joint venture’s net loss incurred for the
    period from February 5, 2008 (its date of inception) to
    December 31, 2008.



LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Sources
    of Cash

We have historically relied on cash flow from operations,
    borrowings under a credit facility and issuances of convertible
    notes and equity securities for our liquidity needs.

In fiscal 2007, we entered into a five-year $1 billion
    senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in July
    2011. In order to be able to draw on the credit facility, we
    must maintain certain covenants, including a specified ratio of
    debt to earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation,
    amortization and impairment) as well as certain other
    non-financial covenants. As of April 2, 2010, we were in
    compliance with all required covenants and there was no
    outstanding balance on the credit facility.

As of April 2, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of
    $3.0 billion and short-term investments of $15 million
    resulting in a net liquidity position of approximately
    $4.0 billion, which is defined as unused availability of
    the credit facility, cash and cash equivalents and short-term
    investments.

We believe that our existing cash and investment balances, our
    borrowing capacity, our ability to issue new debt instruments,
    and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet
    our working capital and capital expenditures requirements for at
    least the next 12 months.

Uses of
    Cash

Our principal cash requirements include working capital, capital
    expenditures, payments of principal and interest on our debt and
    payments of taxes. In addition, we regularly evaluate our
    ability to repurchase stock, pay debts and acquire other
    businesses.

Line of Credit.

There were no borrowings under
    our credit facility for the fiscal year ended April 2,
    2010. For the fiscal year ended April 3, 2009, we repaid
    the entire $200 million principal amount, plus
    $3 million of accrued interest, that we borrowed during
    fiscal 2008 under the credit facility.

Acquisition-related.

For fiscal 2010, we
    acquired two companies for an aggregate payment of
    $31 million, net of cash acquired. For fiscal 2009, we
    acquired MessageLabs, PC Tools, SwapDrive and several other
    companies for an aggregate payment of $1.1 billion, net of
    cash acquired. For fiscal 2008, we acquired Altiris and two
    other companies for an aggregate payment of $1.2 billion,
    net of cash acquired. Also, in fiscal 2008, we entered into a
    joint venture with Huawei Technologies Co., Limited and
    contributed $150 million in cash.

Convertible Senior Notes.

In June 2006, we
    issued $1.1 billion principal amount of
    0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2011, and
    $1.0 billion principal amount of 1.00% Convertible
    Senior Notes (collectively the “Senior Notes”) due
    June 15, 2013. Concurrently with the issuance of the Senior
    Notes, we entered into note hedge transactions for
    $592 million with affiliates of certain of the initial
    purchasers whereby we have the option to purchase up to
    110 million shares of our common stock at a price of $19.12
    per share. For the fiscal years ended April 2, 2010,
    April 3, 2009 and March 28, 2008, we have not repaid
    any of this debt other than the related interest costs.

Stock Repurchases.

We repurchased
    34 million, 42 million and 81 million shares for
    $553 million, $700 million and $1.5 billion
    during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of
    April 2, 2010, we had $747 million remaining under the
    plan authorized for future repurchases.

Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion
    for fiscal 2010, which resulted from net income of
    $714 million adjusted for non-cash items, including
    depreciation and amortization charges of $837 million and
    stock-based compensation expense of $155 million. These
    amounts were partially offset by a decrease in income taxes
    payable of $105 million primarily related to the outcome of
    the

Veritas v. Commissioner

Tax Court decision (see
    Note 13).

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion
    for fiscal 2009, which resulted from non-cash charges related to
    depreciation and amortization expenses of $933 million and
    the $7.4 billion goodwill impairment charge offset by the
    net loss of $6.8 billion.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion
    for fiscal 2008, which resulted from net income of
    $410 million adjusted for non-cash items, including
    depreciation and amortization charges of $915 million,
    stock-based compensation expense of $164 million, income
    taxes payable of $196 million and an increase in deferred
    revenue of $127 million. These amounts were partially
    offset by a decrease in non-cash deferred income taxes of
    $216 million.

Investing
    Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $65 million for
    fiscal 2010 and was primarily due to $248 million paid for
    capital expenditures, partially offset by net proceeds from the
    sale of

available-for-sale

securities of $190 million.

Net cash used in investing activities was $1.0 billion for
    fiscal 2009 and was primarily due to an aggregate payment of
    $1.1 billion in cash payments for acquisitions, net of cash
    acquired, and $272 million paid for capital expenditures,
    partially offset by net proceeds of $336 million from the
    sale of short-term investments which were used to partially fund
    acquisitions.

Net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion for
    fiscal 2008 and was primarily due to an aggregate payment of
    $1.3 billion in cash paid for acquisitions and the joint
    venture, net of cash acquired.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash used in financing activities of $441 million for
    fiscal 2010 was due to repurchases of common stock of
    $553 million, partially offset by net proceeds from sales
    of common stock through employee stock plans of
    $124 million.

Net cash used in financing activities was $677 million for
    fiscal 2009 and was primarily due to repurchases of common stock
    of $700 million and the repayment of $200 million on
    our revolving credit facility, partially offset by net proceeds
    from sales of common stock through employee stock plans of
    $229 million.

Net cash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion for
    fiscal 2008 and was primarily due to repurchases of common stock
    of $1.5 billion, partially offset by the net proceeds from
    sales of common stock through employee stock plans of
    $224 million and a borrowing on our revolving credit
    facility of $200 million.

Indemnifications

As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we
    indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or
    occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at
    our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of
    future payments we could be required to make under these
    indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have
    directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage that
    reduces our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of
    any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of
    these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable
    insurance coverage is minimal.

We provide limited product warranties and the majority of our
    software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify
    licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from
    claims alleging that our software



infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party.
    Historically, payments made under these provisions have been
    immaterial. We monitor the conditions that are subject to
    indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred.

Recently
    Adopted Authoritative Guidance

In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted new
    authoritative guidance on convertible debt instruments that
    requires the issuer of convertible debt instruments with cash
    settlement features to separately account for the liability and
    equity components of the instrument. The debt is recognized at
    the present value of its cash flows discounted using the
    issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of
    issuance. The equity component is recognized as the difference
    between the proceeds from the issuance of the note and the fair
    value of the liability. This guidance also requires interest to
    be accreted as interest expense of the resultant debt discount
    over the expected life of the debt. This guidance applies to the
    0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2011 and
    the 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2013,
    collectively referred to as the Senior Notes. Prior to the
    adoption of this guidance, the liability of the Senior Notes was
    carried at its principal value and only the contractual interest
    expense was recognized in our Consolidated Statements of
    Operations. Because this guidance requires retrospective
    adoption, we were required to adjust all periods for which the
    Senior Notes were outstanding before the date of adoption. See
    Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
    this annual report for additional information on the adoption.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted new
    authoritative guidance on business combinations that requires an
    acquiring entity to measure and recognize identifiable assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair
    value with limited exceptions. The changes include the treatment
    of acquisition related transaction costs, the valuation of any
    noncontrolling interest at acquisition date fair value, the
    recording of acquired contingent liabilities at acquisition date
    fair value and the subsequent re-measurement of such liabilities
    after the acquisition date, the recognition of capitalized
    in-process research and development, the accounting for
    acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals subsequent to
    the acquisition date, and the recognition of changes in the
    acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance. Our acquisitions
    during fiscal 2010 have been accounted for using this new
    authoritative guidance. See Note 4 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report for
    information on our business combinations. The adoption of this
    guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial statements, however, it could have a material impact
    on future periods.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted new
    authoritative guidance on the recognition and measurement of

other-than-temporary

impairments for debt securities that replaced the pre-existing
    “intent and ability” indicator. This guidance
    specifies that if the fair value of a debt security is less than
    its amortized cost basis, an

other-than-temporary

impairment is triggered in circumstances in which (1) an
    entity has an intent to sell the security, (2) it is more
    likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the
    security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or
    (3) the entity does not expect to recover the entire
    amortized cost basis of the security (that is, a credit loss
    exists).

Other-than-temporary

impairments are separated into amounts representing credit
    losses, which are recognized in earnings, and amounts related to
    all other factors, which are recognized in other comprehensive
    income (loss). The adoption of this guidance did not have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted new
    authoritative guidance on noncontrolling (minority) interests in
    consolidated financial statements, which includes requiring
    noncontrolling interests be classified as a component of
    consolidated stockholders’ equity and to identify earnings
    attributable to noncontrolling interests reported as part of
    consolidated earnings. The guidance also requires the gain or
    loss on the deconsolidated subsidiary be measured using the fair
    value of the noncontrolling equity investment. The adoption of
    this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial statements.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted new
    authoritative guidance that specifies the way in which fair
    value measurements should be made for non-financial assets and
    liabilities that are not measured and recorded at fair value on
    a recurring basis, and specifies additional disclosures related
    to these fair value measurements. The adoption of this guidance
    did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    statements.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted new
    authoritative guidance on revenue recognition for
    multiple-element arrangements. The new standard changes the
    requirements for establishing separate units of



accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the
    allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to
    be based on the relative selling price. The new standard
    establishes a selling price hierarchy that allows for the use of
    an estimated selling price to determine the allocation of
    arrangement consideration to a deliverable in a multiple element
    arrangement where neither VSOE nor TPE is available for that
    deliverable. Concurrently to issuing the new standard, the FASB
    also issued new authoritative guidance that excludes tangible
    products that contain software and non-software elements that
    function together to provide the tangible products’
    essential functionality from the scope of software revenue
    guidance. We have elected to adopt the new accounting standards
    as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 for applicable transactions
    originating from or materially modified after April 2,
    2009. Our adoption did not have a material impact on our
    financial statements. Our joint venture also adopted the
    accounting standards during its period ended December 31,
    2009, which was applied to the beginning of its fiscal year. As
    a result of the joint venture’s adoption of the accounting
    standards, our Loss from joint venture decreased by
    $12 million during our fiscal 2010. See Note 6 for
    further details regarding the impact of this guidance on our
    joint venture.

Recently
    Issued Authoritative Guidance

In June 2009, the FASB issued revised guidance which changes the
    model for determining whether an entity should consolidate a
    variable interest entity (“VIE”). The standard
    replaces the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation
    for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial
    interest in a VIE with an approach focused on identifying which
    enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a VIE and
    the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to
    receive the entity’s residual returns. The statement is
    effective as of the first quarter of our fiscal 2011, and early
    adoption is prohibited. We do not expect the adoption of this
    new authoritative guidance to have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations
    in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity
    prices. We may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate
    certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign
    exchange policies. We do not use derivatives or other financial
    instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our
    short-term investment portfolio and the potential losses arising
    from changes in interest rates. Our investment objective is to
    achieve the maximum return compatible with capital preservation
    and our liquidity requirements. Our strategy is to invest our
    cash in a manner that preserves capital, maintains sufficient
    liquidity to meet our cash requirements, maximizes yields
    consistent with approved credit risk, and limits inappropriate
    concentrations of investment by sector, credit, or issuer. We
    classify our cash equivalents and short-term investments in
    accordance with the authoritative guidance on investments. We
    consider investments in instruments purchased with an original
    maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. We
    classify our short-term investments as

available-for-sale.

Short-term investments consist of marketable debt or equity
    securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days.
    Our cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolios
    consist primarily of money market funds, commercial paper,
    corporate debt securities, and U.S. government and
    government-sponsored debt securities. Our short-term investments
    do not include equity investments in privately held companies.
    Our short-term investments are reported at fair value with
    unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in Accumulated
    other comprehensive income within Stockholders’ equity in
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of premiums
    and discounts on the investments, realized gains and losses, and
    declines in value judged to be

other-than-temporary

on

available-for-sale

securities are included in Other income, net in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. We use the specific identification
    method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and
    losses upon sale of short-term investments.

    100 bps, plus 50 bps, minus 25 bps, and minus
    75 bps.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We conduct business in 44 currencies through our worldwide
    operations and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency
    risk. Foreign currency risks are associated with our cash and
    cash equivalents, investments, receivables, and payables
    denominated in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in exchange
    rates will result in foreign exchange gains and losses on these
    foreign currency assets and liabilities and are included in
    Other income, net. Our objective in managing foreign exchange
    activity is to preserve stockholder value by minimizing the risk
    of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Our strategy is to
    primarily utilize forward contracts to hedge foreign currency
    exposures. Under our program, gains and losses in our foreign
    currency exposures are offset by losses and gains on our forward
    contracts. Our forward contracts generally have terms of one to
    six months. At the end of the reporting period, open contracts
    are

marked-to-market

with unrealized gains and losses included in Other income, net.

The following table presents a sensitivity analysis on our
    foreign forward exchange contract portfolio using a statistical

Equity
    Price Risk

In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion principal amount of
    0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 and
    $1.0 billion of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due
    2013. Holders may convert their Senior Notes prior to maturity
    upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion,
    we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number
    of shares of Symantec common stock, up to the principal amount
    of the note. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any,
    may be paid in cash or in stock at our option. Concurrent with
    the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered into convertible
    note hedge transactions and separately, warrant transactions, to
    reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the Senior
    Notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may
    have on the price of our common stock.

For business and strategic purposes, we also hold equity
    interests in several privately held companies, many of which can
    be considered to be in the

start-up

or
    development stages. These investments are inherently risky and
    we could lose a substantial part or our entire investment in
    these companies. These investments are recorded at cost and



classified as Other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. As of April 2, 2010, these investments had an
    aggregate carrying value of $22 million.

Controls
    and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The SEC defines the term “disclosure controls and
    procedures” to mean a company’s controls and other
    procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
    to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under
    the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and
    reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms. “Disclosure controls and procedures”
    include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in
    the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management,
    including its principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded, based on an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Exchange Act) by our management, with the participation of
    our Chief Executive Officer and our



Chief Financial Officer, that our disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by
    this report.

(b)

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Exchange Act) for Symantec. Our management, with the
    participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
    Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of April 2, 2010, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Our management has concluded that, as of April 2, 2010, our
    internal control over financial reporting was effective based on
    these criteria.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
    has issued an attestation report regarding its assessment of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    April 2, 2010, which is included in Part IV,
    Item 15 of this annual report.

(c)

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting during the quarter ended April 2, 2010 that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(d)

Limitations
    on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors
    and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
    and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
    assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
    Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
    that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
    controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of
    the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
    of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
    issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have
    been detected.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements




REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Symantec Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
    as of April 2, 2010 and April 3, 2009, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
    and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
    ended April 2, 2010. In connection with our audits of the
    consolidated financial statements we have also audited the
    related financial statement schedule listed in Item 15.
    These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    April 2, 2010 and April 3, 2009, and the results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended April 2, 2010, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in
    our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective April 4, 2009, Symantec Corporation
    changed its method of accounting for convertible debt
    instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion
    (including partial cash settlement) by retrospectively adopting
    new accounting requirements issued by the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Symantec Corporation’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of April 2, 2010, based on criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and
    our report dated May 21, 2010 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Symantec Corporation:

We have audited Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the
    “Company”) internal control over financial reporting
    as of April 2, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (“COSO”). The Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A(b). Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of April 2, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Symantec Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of April 2, 2010 and April 3, 2009,
    and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended April 2, 2010, and our
    report dated May 21, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion
    on those consolidated financial statements.

SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Symantec Corporation (“we,” “us,”
    “our,” and “the Company” refer to Symantec
    Corporation and all of its subsidiaries) is a provider of
    security, storage and systems management solutions that help
    businesses and consumers secure and manage their information. We
    provide customers worldwide with software and services that
    protect, manage and control information risks related to
    security, data protection, storage, compliance, and systems
    management. We help our customers manage cost, complexity and
    compliance by protecting their IT infrastructure as they seek to
    maximize value from their IT investments.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Symantec
    Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are prepared in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
    United States. All significant intercompany accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior year amounts
    have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation
    with no impact on previously reported net income.

Fiscal
    Calendar

We have a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to
    March 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in
    this report relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years.

Fiscal Year

Ended

Weeks


April 2, 2010



April 3, 2009



March 28, 2008


Our 2011 fiscal year will consist of 52 weeks and will end
    on April 1, 2011.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
    United States requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
    financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based
    upon historical factors, current circumstances and the
    experience and judgment of management. Management evaluates its
    assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may engage
    outside subject matter experts to assist in its valuations.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant
    items subject to such estimates and assumptions include those
    related to the allocation of revenue between recognized and
    deferred amounts, fair value of financial instruments, valuation
    of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets, valuation
    of stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation, and
    the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally
    the local currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in
    foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate on the
    balance sheet dates. Revenues and expenses are translated using
    monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the year. The
    translation adjustments resulting from this process are included
    as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income. In
    event of liquidation of a foreign subsidiary, the accumulated
    translation adjustment attributable to that foreign subsidiary
    is reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income and
    included in Other Income, net. As a result of such liquidations
    in fiscal 2010 and 2009, we recorded a net gain of
    $47 million and a net loss of $5 million,
    respectively. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
    also included in Other income, net, in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. Foreign currency transaction losses
    were $3 million and $8 million for



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

fiscal 2010 and 2008, respectively. We had a foreign currency
    transaction gain in fiscal 2009 of $11 million. Deferred
    tax assets (liabilities) are established on the cumulative
    translation adjustment attributable to unremitted foreign
    earnings that are not intended to be indefinitely reinvested.

Revenue
    Recognition

We market and distribute our software products both as
    stand-alone products and as integrated product suites. We
    recognize revenue when 1) persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists, 2) delivery has occurred or services
    have been rendered, 3) fees are fixed or determinable and
    4) collectability is probable. If we determine that any one
    of the four criteria is not met, we will defer recognition of
    revenue until all the criteria are met.

We derive revenue primarily from sales of content,
    subscriptions, and maintenance and licenses. We present revenue
    net of sales taxes and any similar assessments.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue includes
    arrangements for software maintenance and technical support for
    our products, content and subscription services primarily
    related to our security products, revenue from arrangements
    where vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of
    the fair value of undelivered elements does not exist,
    arrangements for managed security services, and
    Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) offerings. These
    arrangements are generally offered to our customers over a
    specified period of time, and we recognize the related revenue
    ratably over the maintenance, subscription, or service period.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue also includes
    professional services revenue, which consists primarily of the
    fees we earn related to consulting and educational services. We
    generally recognize revenue from professional services as the
    services are performed or upon written acceptance from
    customers, if applicable, assuming all other conditions for
    revenue recognition noted above have been met.

License revenue is derived primarily from the licensing of our
    various products and technology. We generally recognize license
    revenue upon delivery of the product, assuming all other
    conditions for revenue recognition noted above have been met.

We enter into perpetual software license agreements through
    direct sales to customers and indirect sales with distributors
    and resellers. The license agreements generally include product
    maintenance agreements, for which the related revenue is
    included with Content, subscriptions, and maintenance and is
    deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the
    agreements.

For arrangements that include multiple elements, including
    perpetual software licenses, maintenance, services, and packaged
    products with content updates, managed security services, and
    subscriptions, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered
    items based on VSOE of the fair value of the undelivered
    elements, and recognize the difference between the total
    arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered
    items as license revenue. VSOE of each element is based on
    historical evidence of our stand-alone sales of these elements
    to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the
    undelivered elements. When VSOE does not exist for undelivered
    items, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the
    performance period. Our deferred revenue consists primarily of
    the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance,
    consumer product content update subscriptions, and arrangements
    where VSOE does not exist for an undelivered element.

For arrangements that include both software and non-software
    elements that are within the scope of the newly adopted
    accounting standards, further described below under
    “Recently Adopted Authoritative Guidance”, we allocate
    revenue to the software deliverables as a group and non-software
    deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such
    circumstances, the new accounting principles establish a
    hierarchy to determine the selling price used for allocating
    revenue to the deliverables as follows: (i) VSOE,
    (ii) third-party evidence of selling price
    (“TPE”) and (iii) best estimate of the selling
    price (“ESP”). Our appliance products, SaaS and
    certain other services are considered to be non-software
    elements in our arrangements.



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE,
    we use ESP in the allocation of arrangement consideration. The
    objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would
    transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a
    stand-alone basis. The determination of ESP is made through
    consultation with and formal approval by our management, taking
    into consideration the go-to-market strategy and pricing
    factors. ESP applies to a small portion of our arrangements with
    multiple deliverables.

Indirect
    channel sales

For our Consumer segment, we sell packaged software products
    through a multi-tiered distribution channel. We also sell
    electronic download and packaged products via the Internet. We
    separately sell annual content update subscriptions directly to
    end-users primarily via the Internet. For our consumer products
    that include content updates, we recognize revenue ratably over
    the term of the subscription upon sell-through to end-users, as
    the subscription period commences on the date of sale to the
    end-user. For most other consumer products, we recognize
    packaged product revenue on distributor and reseller channel
    inventory that is not in excess of specified inventory levels in
    these channels. We offer the right of return of our products
    under various policies and programs with our distributors,
    resellers, and end-user customers. We estimate and record
    reserves for product returns as an offset to revenue. We fully
    reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channel as an
    offset to deferred revenue for products with content updates and
    to revenue for all other products.

For our Security and Compliance and Storage and Server
    Management segments, we generally recognize revenue from the
    licensing of software products through our indirect sales
    channel upon sell-through or with evidence of an end-user. For
    licensing of our software to OEMs, royalty revenue is recognized
    when the OEM reports the sale of the software products to an
    end-user, generally on a quarterly basis. In addition to license
    royalties, some OEMs pay an annual flat fee

and/or

support royalties for the right to sell maintenance and
    technical support to the end-user. We recognize revenue from OEM
    support royalties and fees ratably over the term of the support
    agreement.

We offer channel and end-user rebates for our products. Our
    estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are
    based on distributors’ and resellers’ actual
    performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive
    rebate programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our
    reserves for end-user rebates are estimated based on the terms
    and conditions of the promotional program, actual sales during
    the promotion, amount of actual redemptions received, historical
    redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program,
    and the value of the rebate. We estimate and record reserves for
    channel and end-user rebates as an offset to revenue. For
    consumer products that include content updates, rebates are
    recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the term of the
    subscription.

Financial
    Instruments

The following methods were used to estimate the fair value of
    each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable
    to estimate that value:

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

We consider all
    highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
    months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are
    recognized at fair value. As of April 2, 2010, our cash
    equivalents consisted of $2 billion in money market funds,
    $216 million in bank securities and deposits, and
    $116 million in government securities. As of April 3,
    2009, our cash equivalents consisted of $389 million in
    money market funds, $474 million in bank securities and
    deposits, and $479 million in government securities.

Short-Term Investments.

Short-term investments
    consist of marketable debt or equity securities that are
    classified as available-for-sale and recognized at fair value.
    The determination of fair value is further detailed in
    Note 2. Our portfolios generally consist of (1) debt
    securities which include asset-backed securities, corporate
    securities and government securities, and (2) marketable
    equity securities. As of April 2, 2010, our asset-backed
    securities have contractual maturity dates in excess of
    10 years and corporate securities have contractual maturity



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

dates of less than two years. We regularly review our investment
    portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have
    indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in
    determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include: the
    length of time and extent to which the fair market value has
    been lower than the cost basis, the financial condition and
    near-term prospects of the investee, credit quality, likelihood
    of recovery, and our ability to hold the investment for a period
    of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair
    market value.

Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, and
    other-than-temporary impairments for all reasons other than
    credit worthiness are included in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income. The amortization of premiums and discounts
    on the investments, realized gains and losses, and declines in
    value due to credit worthiness judged to be other-than-temporary
    on available-for-sale debt securities are included in Other
    income, net. We use the specific-identification method to
    determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon
    sale of short-term investments.

Equity Investments.

During fiscal 2010, we
    made equity investments in privately held companies whose
    businesses are complementary to our business. These investments
    are accounted for under the cost method of accounting, as we
    hold less than 20% of the voting stock outstanding and do not
    exert significant influence over these companies. The
    investments are included in Other long-term assets. We assess
    the recoverability of these investments by reviewing various
    indicators of impairment and determine the fair value of these
    investments by performing a discounted cash flow analysis of
    estimated future cash flows if there are indicators of
    impairment. If a decline in value is determined to be
    other-than-temporary, impairment would be recognized and
    included in Other income, net. As of April 2, 2010 and
    April 3, 2009, we held equity investments in privately-held
    companies of $22 million and $3 million, respectively.
    Other-than-temporary impairments related to these investments
    were not material for the periods presented.

Derivative Instruments.

We transact business
    in various foreign currencies and have foreign currency risks
    associated with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
    foreign currencies. We utilize foreign currency forward
    contracts to reduce the risks associated with changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates. Our forward contracts generally have
    terms of one to six months. We do not use forward contracts for
    trading purposes. The gains and losses on the contracts are
    intended to offset the gains and losses on the underlying
    transactions. Both the changes in fair value of outstanding
    forward contracts and realized foreign exchange gains and losses
    are included in Other income, net. Contract fair values are
    determined based on quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities in active markets using inputs such as LIBOR,
    currency rates, forward points, and commonly quoted credit risk
    data. For each fiscal period presented in this report,
    outstanding derivative contracts and the related gains or losses
    were not material.

Convertible Senior Notes, Note Hedges and Revolving Credit
    Facility.

Our convertible senior notes are
    recorded at cost based upon par value at issuance less a
    discount for the estimated value of the equity component of the
    notes, which is amortized through maturity as additional
    non-cash interest expense. See Note 7 for further details.
    Debt issuance costs were recorded in Other long-term assets and
    are being amortized to Interest expense using the effective
    interest method over five years for the 0.75% Notes and
    seven years for the 1.00% Notes. In conjunction with the
    issuance of the notes, we entered into note hedge transactions
    which provide us with the option to purchase additional common
    shares at a fixed price after conversion. The cost incurred in
    connection with the note hedge transactions, net of the related
    tax benefit, and the proceeds from the sale of warrants, was
    included as a net reduction in Additional paid-in capital.
    Borrowings under our $1 billion senior unsecured revolving
    credit facility are recognized at cost plus accrued interest
    based upon stated interest rates.

Trade
    Accounts Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
    and are not interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for
    doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible trade
    receivables. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts
    are recorded as General and administrative expenses. We review
    our trade receivables by aging category to identify specific
    customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In
    addition, we maintain an allowance for all other receivables not
    included in the specific reserve by applying specific
    percentages of projected uncollectible receivables to the
    various aging categories. In determining these percentages, we
    analyze our historical collection experience and current
    economic trends. We exercise judgment when



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

determining the adequacy of these reserves as we evaluate
    historical bad debt trends, general economic conditions in the
    U.S. and internationally, and changes in customer financial
    conditions. We also offset deferred revenue against accounts
    receivable when channel inventories are in excess of specified
    levels and for transactions where collection of a receivable is
    not considered probable. The following table summarizes trade
    accounts receivable, net of allowances and reserves, for the

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
    principally determined using the

first-in,

first-out method. Inventory predominantly consists of deferred
    costs of revenue and finished goods. Deferred costs of revenue
    were $23 million as of April 2, 2010 and
    $24 million as of April 3, 2009, of which
    $17 million in both periods was related to consumer
    products that include content updates and will be recognized
    ratably over the term of the subscription.

Property
    and Equipment

Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements are stated at
    cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. We also
    capitalize certain costs incurred related to the development of
    internal use software. We capitalize costs incurred during the
    application development stage related to the development of
    internal use software. We expense costs incurred related to the
    planning and post-implementation phases of development as
    incurred. Depreciation and amortization is provided on a
    straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
    related assets. Buildings are depreciated over 20 to
    30 years, and leasehold improvements are depreciated over
    the lesser of the life of the improvement or the initial lease
    term. Computer hardware and software is depreciated over three
    to five years and office furniture and equipment is depreciated
    over a three to five-year period. The following table summarizes
    property and equipment by categories for the periods presented:

Depreciation expense was $247 million, $250 million
    and $255 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Business
    Combinations

We use the acquisition method of accounting under the
    authoritative guidance on business combinations. Each acquired
    company’s operating results are included in our
    consolidated financial statements starting on the date of
    acquisition. The purchase price is equivalent to the fair value
    of consideration transferred. Tangible and identifiable
    intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the
    date of acquisition are recorded at the acquisition date fair
    value. Goodwill is recognized for the excess of purchase price
    over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed.

Amounts allocated to assets and liabilities are based upon fair
    values. Such valuations require management to make significant
    estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to the
    identifiable intangible assets. Management makes estimates of
    fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable and
    that of a market participant. These estimates are based on
    historical experience and information obtained from the
    management of the acquired companies and are inherently
    uncertain. The separately identifiable intangible assets
    generally include acquired product rights, developed technology,
    customer lists and tradenames. We did not acquire in-process
    research and development (“IPR&D”) in the fiscal
    years 2010, 2009 and 2008. We estimate the fair value of
    deferred revenue related to product support assumed in
    connection with acquisitions. The estimated fair value of
    deferred revenue is determined by estimating the costs related
    to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The
    estimated costs to fulfill the support contracts are based on
    the historical direct costs related to providing the support.

For any given acquisition, we may identify certain
    pre-acquisition contingencies. We estimate the fair value of
    such contingencies, which are included under the acquisition
    method as part of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed, as
    appropriate. Differences from these estimates are recorded in
    the period in which they are identified.

Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

Goodwill.

Our methodology for allocating the
    purchase price relating to acquisitions is determined through
    established valuation techniques. Goodwill is measured as the
    excess of the cost of the acquisition over the sum of the
    amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets
    acquired less liabilities assumed. We review goodwill for
    impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of the
    fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. In
    testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we determine the
    carrying value (book value) of the assets and liabilities for
    each reporting unit, which requires the allocation of goodwill
    to each reporting unit. We then estimate the fair value of each
    reporting unit, which are the same as our operating segments.
    The first step in evaluating goodwill for impairment is to
    determine if the estimated fair value of equity is greater than
    the carrying value of equity of each reporting unit. If step one
    indicates that impairment potentially exists, the second step is
    performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. Goodwill
    impairment exists when the estimated fair value of goodwill is
    less than its carrying value.

To determine the reporting units’ fair values in the
    current year analysis, we use the income approach which is based
    on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that reporting
    unit. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the
    income approach is corroborated with the market approach which
    measures the value of an asset through an analysis of recent
    sales or offerings of comparable property. We also consider our
    market capitalization on the date of the analysis. The
    methodology applied in the current year analysis was consistent
    with the methodology applied in the prior year analysis, but was
    based on updated assumptions, as appropriate.

Our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted
    revenue, operating costs and other relevant factors. To
    determine the reporting units’ carrying values, we
    allocated assets and liabilities based on either specific



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

identification or by using judgment for the remaining assets and
    liabilities that are not specific to a reporting unit. Goodwill
    was allocated to the reporting units based on a combination of
    specific identification and relative fair values, which is
    consistent with the methodology utilized in the prior year
    impairment analysis. The use of relative fair values was
    necessary for certain reporting units due to impairment charges
    and changes in our operating structure in prior years.

Prior to performing our second step in the goodwill impairment
    analysis, we perform an assessment of long-lived assets,
    including intangible assets, for impairment.

Intangible Assets.

In connection with our
    acquisitions, we generally recognize assets for customer
    relationships, developed technology, acquired product rights
    (purchased product rights, technologies, databases, patents, and
    contracts) and tradenames. Intangible assets are recognized at
    cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization of intangible
    assets is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated
    useful lives of the respective assets, generally from one to
    eleven years. Amortization for developed technology and acquired
    product rights is recognized in Cost of revenue. Amortization
    for customer lists and tradenames is recognized in Operating
    expenses.

On an interim basis, we determine if triggering events for
    impairment of intangible assets are present, and if so assess
    recoverability of those intangible assets. To determine the
    recoverability of our definite-lived intangible assets, when
    indicators of impairment are identified, we compare the carrying
    amounts against the estimated future cash flows related to the
    underlying group of assets. These estimates are based on company
    forecasts and are subject to change. In addition, for intangible
    assets with indefinite lives, we review such assets for
    impairment on an annual basis consistent with the timing of the
    annual evaluation for goodwill.

We record impairment charges on developed technology or acquired
    product rights when we determine that the net realizable value
    of the assets may not be recoverable. To determine the net
    realizable value of the assets, we use the estimated future
    gross revenue from each product. Our estimated future gross
    revenue of each product is based on forecasts and is subject to
    change.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and
    liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for
    operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in each jurisdiction
    in which we operate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to
    taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets
    are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation
    allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is
    believed more likely than not to be realized.

We are required to compute our income taxes in each federal,
    state, and international jurisdiction in which we operate. This
    process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as
    well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and
    tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as
    accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax
    purposes. The income tax effects of the differences we identify
    are classified as current or long-term deferred tax assets and
    liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our judgments,
    assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for
    income tax take into account current tax laws, our
    interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of
    current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax
    authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax
    laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could
    significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of
    Operations. We must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax
    assets will be realized from future taxable income and, based on
    this assessment, establish a valuation allowance, if required.
    Our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a
    number of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including
    forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and the relative
    proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various
    domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. To
    the extent we establish a



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a
    period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or
    decrease to our tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

We adopted authoritative guidance on income taxes, effective
    March 31, 2007, that clarifies the accounting for income
    taxes, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax
    position is required to meet before being recognized in the
    financial statements. It also provides guidance on
    derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
    transition.

This guidance prescribes a two-step process to determine the
    amount of tax benefit to be recognized. The first step is to
    evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
    weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely
    than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including
    resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
    The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax
    benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be
    realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult
    and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to
    determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We
    reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis.
    This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited
    to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law,
    effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity.
    Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the
    recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax
    provision in the period.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on
    the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over
    the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting
    period of the respective award. No compensation cost is
    ultimately recognized for awards for which employees do not
    render the requisite service and are forfeited.

Fair Value of Stock-Based Awards.

We use the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value
    of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value
    of options using an option-pricing model is affected by our
    stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex
    and subjective variables. These variables include our expected
    stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and
    projected employee stock option exercise and cancellation
    behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. We
    estimate the expected life of options granted based on an
    analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and
    post-vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the
    contractual life of the option. Expected volatility is based on
    the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate
    with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility
    of traded options. The risk free interest rate is equal to the
    U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal
    to the expected life. We do not currently pay cash dividends on
    our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the
    foreseeable future. Accordingly, our expected dividend yield is
    zero. The fair value of each RSU is equal to the market value of
    Symantec’s common stock on the date of grant. The fair
    value of each ESPP purchase right is equal to the 15% discount
    on shares purchased.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

A significant portion of our revenue and net income (loss) is
    derived from international sales and independent agents and
    distributors. Fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against
    foreign currencies, changes in local regulatory or economic
    conditions, piracy, or nonperformance by independent agents or
    distributors could adversely affect operating results.

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and
    cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade accounts
    receivable, and forward foreign exchange contracts. Our
    investment portfolio is diversified and consists of investment
    grade securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of
    credit risk exposure to any one issuer and in any one country.
    We are exposed to credit risks in the event of default by the
    issuers to the extent of the amount recorded in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. The credit risk in our



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

trade accounts receivable is substantially mitigated by our
    credit evaluation process, reasonably short collection terms,
    and the geographical dispersion of sales transactions. We
    maintain reserves for potential credit losses and such losses
    have been within management’s expectations. See
    Note 11 for details of significant customers.

Advertising
    costs

Advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred and
    include electronic and print advertising, trade shows,
    collateral production, and all forms of direct marketing.
    Starting in January 2007, certain advertising contracts contain
    placement fee arrangements with escalation clauses which are
    expensed on an estimated average cost basis over the term of the
    arrangement. The difference between the actual placement fee
    paid and the estimated average placement fee cost was
    $47 million and $82 million for fiscal 2010 and fiscal
    2009, respectively. Advertising costs included in Sales and
    marketing expense for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008 were
    $615 million, $572 million, and $555 million,
    respectively.

Recently
    Adopted Authoritative Guidance

In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted new
    authoritative guidance on convertible debt instruments that
    requires the issuer of convertible debt instruments with cash
    settlement features to separately account for the liability and
    equity components of the instrument. The debt is recognized at
    the present value of its cash flows discounted using the
    issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of
    issuance. The equity component is recognized as the difference
    between the proceeds from the issuance of the note and the fair
    value of the liability. This guidance also requires interest to
    be accreted as interest expense of the resultant debt discount
    over the expected life of the debt. This guidance applies to the
    0.75% Convertible Senior Notes
    (“0.75% Notes”) due June 15, 2011 and the
    1.00% Convertible Senior Notes
    (“1.00% Notes”) due June 15, 2013,
    collectively referred to as the Senior Notes. Prior to the
    adoption of this guidance, the liability of the Senior Notes was
    carried at its principal value and only the contractual interest
    expense was recognized in our Consolidated Statements of
    Operations. Because this guidance requires retrospective
    adoption, we were required to adjust all periods for which the
    Senior Notes were outstanding before the date of adoption.

Upon adoption of this guidance and effective as of the issuance
    date of the Senior Notes in June 2006, we recorded
    $586 million of the principal amount to equity,
    representing the debt discount for the difference between our
    estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of 6.78% at the
    time of issuance and the coupon rate of the Senior Notes. This
    debt discount, recorded in additional paid-in capital, is
    amortized as additional non-cash interest expense over the
    contractual terms of the Senior Notes using the effective
    interest method. In addition, we allocated $9 million of
    the issuance costs to the equity component of the Senior Notes
    and the remaining $24 million of the issuance costs to the
    debt component of the Senior Notes. The issuance costs were
    allocated pro rata based on the relative carrying amounts of the
    debt and equity components. The debt issuance costs associated
    with the debt component are amortized as interest expense over
    the respective contractual terms of the Senior Notes using the
    effective interest method.

Upon adoption of this guidance and effective as of the issuance

    between the carrying value and tax basis that resulted from
    allocating $586 million of the principal amount of the
    Senior Notes and $9 million of the associated issuance
    costs to equity. In subsequent periods, we recorded adjustments
    to deferred taxes to reflect the tax effect of the amortization
    of the debt discount and debt issuance costs.

Other
    Recently Adopted Authoritative Guidance

In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted new
    authoritative guidance on business combinations that requires an
    acquiring entity to measure and recognize identifiable assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair
    value with limited exceptions. The changes include the treatment
    of acquisition related transaction costs, the valuation of any
    noncontrolling interest at acquisition date fair value, the
    recording of acquired contingent liabilities at acquisition date
    fair value and the subsequent re-measurement of such liabilities
    after the acquisition date, the recognition of capitalized
    in-process research and development, the accounting for
    acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals subsequent to
    the acquisition date, and the recognition of changes in the
    acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance. Our acquisitions
    during fiscal 2010 have been accounted for using this new
    authoritative guidance. See Note 4. The adoption of this
    guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial statements, however, it could have a material impact
    on future periods.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted new
    authoritative guidance on the recognition and measurement of
    other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities that
    replaced the pre-existing “intent and ability”
    indicator.



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

This guidance specifies that if the fair value of a debt
    security is less than its amortized cost basis, an
    other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances in
    which (1) an entity has an intent to sell the security,
    (2) it is more likely than not that the entity will be
    required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized
    cost basis, or (3) the entity does not expect to recover
    the entire amortized cost basis of the security (that is, a
    credit loss exists). Other-than-temporary impairments are
    separated into amounts representing credit losses, which are
    recognized in earnings, and amounts related to all other
    factors, which are recognized in other comprehensive income
    (loss). The adoption of this guidance did not have a material
    impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted new
    authoritative guidance on noncontrolling (minority) interests in
    consolidated financial statements, which includes requiring
    noncontrolling interests be classified as a component of
    consolidated stockholders’ equity and to identify earnings
    attributable to noncontrolling interests reported as part of
    consolidated earnings. The guidance also requires the gain or
    loss on the deconsolidated subsidiary be measured using the fair
    value of the noncontrolling equity investment. The adoption of
    this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial statements.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted new
    authoritative guidance that specifies the way in which fair
    value measurements should be made for non-financial assets and
    liabilities that are not measured and recorded at fair value on
    a recurring basis, and specifies additional disclosures related
    to these fair value measurements. The adoption of this guidance
    did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    statements.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we adopted new
    authoritative guidance on revenue recognition for
    multiple-element arrangements. The new standard changes the
    requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a
    multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of
    arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the
    relative selling price. The new standard establishes a selling
    price hierarchy that allows for the use of an estimated selling
    price to determine the allocation of arrangement consideration
    to a deliverable in a multiple element arrangement where neither
    VSOE nor TPE is available for that deliverable. Concurrently to
    issuing the new standard, the FASB also issued new authoritative
    guidance that excludes tangible products that contain software
    and non-software elements that function together to provide the
    tangible products’ essential functionality from the scope
    of software revenue guidance. We have elected to adopt the new
    accounting standards as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 for
    applicable transactions originating from or materially modified
    after April 2, 2009. Our adoption did not have a material
    impact on our financial statements. Our joint venture also
    adopted the accounting standards during its period ended
    December 31, 2009, which was applied to the beginning of
    its fiscal year. As a result of the joint venture’s
    adoption of the accounting standards, our Loss from joint
    venture decreased by $12 million during our fiscal 2010.
    See Note 6 for further details regarding the impact of this
    guidance on our joint venture.

Recently
    Issued Authoritative Guidance

In June 2009, the FASB issued revised guidance which changes the
    model for determining whether an entity should consolidate a
    variable interest entity (“VIE”). The standard
    replaces the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation
    for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial
    interest in a VIE with an approach focused on identifying which
    enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a VIE and
    the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to
    receive the entity’s residual returns. The statement is
    effective as of the first quarter of our fiscal 2011, and early
    adoption is prohibited. We do not expect the adoption of this
    new authoritative guidance to have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements.

Note 2.

Fair
    Value Measurements

We measure assets and liabilities at fair value based on an
    expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on
    fair value measurements, which represents the amount that would
    be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability, as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between
    market participants. As such, fair value may be based on
    assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an
    asset or liability. The



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a
    consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a
    recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in
    valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The
    following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair
    value:

•

Level 1:

Observable inputs that reflect
    quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities
    in active markets.

•

Level 2:

Inputs reflect: quoted prices
    for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not

In fiscal 2010 and 2009, as part of our ongoing review of real
    estate holdings, we determined that certain properties were
    underutilized. As a result, we committed to sell properties with
    a total estimated fair value, less costs to sell, of
    approximately $34 million and $59 million as of
    April 2, 2010 and April 3, 2009, respectively. Assets
    held for sale are included in Other current assets. We expect
    the sale of the remaining properties to be completed during
    fiscal 2011.

The fair value measurements were based on recent offers made by
    third parties to purchase the properties or on valuation
    appraisals. To reflect the fair value less costs to sell, assets
    held for sale were written down during fiscal 2010, 2009 and
    2008. As a result, we recorded impairments of $20 million,
    $46 million, and $93 million, respectively. We sold
    assets for $42 million and $98 million, which resulted
    in losses of $10 million and $2 million in fiscal 2010
    and 2008, respectively. We also sold properties in fiscal 2009
    for $40 million, which resulted in an immaterial loss.

Fiscal
    2010 acquisitions

During fiscal 2010, we completed two acquisitions of nonpublic
    companies for an aggregate of $42 million in cash. No
    equity interests were issued. We recorded goodwill in connection
    with each of these acquisitions, which resulted primarily from
    our expectation of synergies from the integration of the
    acquired company’s technology with our technology. The
    goodwill for these acquisitions is only partially tax
    deductible, if at all. The results of operations for the
    acquired companies have been included in our results of

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, in accordance with our
    accounting policy as described in Note 1, we performed our
    annual impairment analysis and determined that goodwill was not
    impaired. Based on the impairment analysis performed, we
    determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units
    exceeded its carrying value by more than 20% of the carrying
    value.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, based on a combination
    of factors, including the current economic environment and a
    decline in our market capitalization, we concluded that there
    were sufficient potential impairment indicators that required us
    to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis. The analysis
    was not completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and an
    estimated impairment charge of $7.0 billion was recorded.
    The analysis was subsequently finalized and an additional
    impairment charge of $413 million was included in our
    results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. As a result, we
    recorded a total non-cash goodwill impairment charge based on
    the interim impairment analysis of $7.4 billion for fiscal
    2009. We also performed our annual impairment analysis during
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and determined that no
    additional impairment charge was required.

The calculation of potential goodwill impairment requires
    significant judgment at many points during the analysis. In
    determining the carrying value of equity of the reporting units,
    we applied judgment to allocate assets and liabilities, such as
    accounts receivable and property and equipment, based on the
    specific identification or relevant driver, as they are not held
    by those reporting units but by functional departments.
    Furthermore, we utilize the income approach, under which we
    calculate fair value based on the estimated discounted future
    cash flows of that specific reporting unit. The income approach
    was determined to be the most representative valuation technique
    that would be utilized by a market participant in an assumed
    transaction, but we also considered the market approach which
    measures the value of an asset through an analysis of recent
    sales or offerings of comparable property. We also consider our
    market capitalization on the date we perform our analysis as
    compared to the sum of the fair values of our reporting units to
    assess the reasonableness of the values of the reporting units
    determined under the income approach.

The income approach requires us to make estimates and judgments
    about the future cash flows of each reporting unit as well as
    discount rates to be applied. Although our cash flow forecasts
    are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and
    estimates we are using to manage the underlying reporting units,
    there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows
    attributable to these reporting units. For the fiscal 2010
    analysis, due to the improving overall economic environment and
    its impact on our long-term estimates, our estimated future



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

cash flows are somewhat higher than those used in the prior year
    analysis. Similarly, the discount rates utilized were decreased
    to reflect the decreased risk of volatility in the current
    economic environment. For the fiscal 2009 analysis, as a result
    of the downturn in the economic environment during the second
    half of calendar 2008, determining the fair value of the
    individual reporting units was even more judgmental than in the
    past. In particular, the global economic recession reduced our
    visibility into long-term trends, and consequently, estimates of
    future cash flows used in the analysis were lower than those
    used in the prior year analysis. The discount rates utilized in
    the fiscal 2009 analysis also reflected market-based estimates
    of the risks associated with the projected cash flows of
    individual reporting units and were increased from the previous
    year’s analysis to reflect increased risk due to volatility
    in the economic environment during the period.

Our reporting units are identified in accordance with the
    applicable authoritative guidance and are either equivalent to,
    or represent one level below, an operating segment, which
    constitute a business for which discrete financial information
    is available and for which segment management regularly reviews
    the operating results. Our operating segments are significant
    strategic business units that offer different products and
    services, distinguished by customer needs. Our reporting units
    are consistent with our operating segments.

Investment
    in Joint Venture

On February 5, 2008, Symantec formed Huawei-Symantec, Inc.
    (“joint venture”) with a subsidiary of Huawei
    Technologies Co., Limited (“Huawei”). The joint
    venture is domiciled in Hong Kong with principal operations in
    Chengdu, China. We contributed cash of $150 million,
    licenses related to certain intellectual property and intangible
    assets in exchange for 49% of the outstanding common shares of
    the joint venture. The joint venture develops, manufactures,
    markets and supports security and storage appliances to global
    telecommunications carriers and enterprise customers. Huawei
    contributed its telecommunications storage and security business
    assets, engineering, sales and marketing resources, personnel,
    and licenses related to intellectual property in exchange for a
    51% ownership interest in the joint venture.

The contribution of assets to the joint venture was accounted
    for at its carrying value. The historical carrying value of the
    assets contributed by Symantec comprised a significant portion
    of the net assets of the joint venture. As a result, our
    carrying value of the investment in the joint venture exceeded
    our proportionate share in the book value of the joint venture
    by approximately $75 million upon formation of the joint
    venture. As the contributions for both Symantec and Huawei were
    recorded at historical carrying value by the joint venture, this
    basis difference is attributable to the contributed identified
    intangible assets. The basis difference is being amortized over
    a weighted-average period of 9 years, the estimated useful
    lives of the underlying identified intangible assets to which
    the basis difference is attributed.

On February 5, 2011, we have a one-time option to purchase
    an additional two percent ownership interest from Huawei for
    $28 million. We determined the value of the option using
    the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The value of the option
    is not considered material to the financial statements. We have
    concluded that the option does not meet the definition of a
    derivative under the authoritative guidance. Symantec and Huawei
    each have the right to purchase all of the other partner’s
    ownership interest through a bid process upon certain triggering
    events set to occur as early as February 5, 2011.

We account for our investment in the joint venture under the
    equity method of accounting. Under this method, we record our
    proportionate share of the joint venture’s net income or
    loss based on the quarterly financial statements of the joint
    venture. We record our proportionate share of net income or loss
    one quarter in arrears. In determining our share of the joint
    venture’s net income or loss, we adjust the joint
    venture’s reported results to recognize the amortization
    expense associated with the basis difference described above.

As described in Note 1, the joint venture adopted new
    authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple
    deliverables during its period ended December 31, 2009,
    which was applied to the beginning of its fiscal year. The
    impact of the adoption decreased our proportionate share of net
    loss by $12 million during our fiscal 2010.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

As of April 2, 2010, the remaining weighted-average
    amortization period of the discount and debt issuance costs is
    approximately 2.6 years and the if-converted value of the
    Senior Notes does not exceed the principal amount of the Senior
    Notes.

Each $1,000 of principal of the Senior Notes will initially be
    convertible into 52.2951 shares of Symantec common stock,
    which is the equivalent of $19.12 per share, subject to
    adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of
    the Senior Notes may convert their Senior Notes prior to
    maturity during specified periods as follows: (1) during
    any calendar quarter, beginning after June 30, 2006, if the
    closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days
    in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
    day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than
    130% of the applicable conversion price per share; (2) if
    specified corporate transactions, including a change in control,
    occur; (3) with respect to the 0.75% Notes, at any
    time on or after April 5, 2011, and with respect to the
    1.00% Notes, at any time on or after April 5, 2013; or
    (4) during the five

business-day

period after any five consecutive

trading-day

period during which the trading price of the Senior Notes falls
    below a certain threshold. Upon conversion, we would pay the
    holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of
    Symantec common stock, up to the principal amount of the note.
    Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid
    in cash or in stock at our option. Holders who convert their
    Senior Notes in connection with a change in control may be
    entitled to a “make whole” premium in the form of an
    increase in the conversion rate. As of April 2, 2010, none
    of the conditions allowing holders of the Senior Notes to
    convert had been met. In addition, upon a change in control of
    Symantec, the holders of the Senior Notes may require us to
    repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Senior Notes for
    100% of the principal amount.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered
    into note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain initial
    purchasers whereby we have the option to purchase up to
    110 million shares of our common stock at a price of $19.12
    per share. The options as to 58 million shares expire on
    June 15, 2011 and the options as to 52 million shares
    expire on June 15, 2013. The options must be settled in net
    shares. The cost of the note hedge transactions to us was
    approximately $592 million. In addition, we sold warrants
    to affiliates of certain initial purchasers whereby they have
    the option to purchase up to 110 million shares of our
    common stock at a price of $27.3175 per share. The warrants
    expire on various dates from July 2011 through August 2013 and
    must be settled in net shares. We received approximately
    $326 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these
    warrants.

The Senior Notes will have no impact on diluted earnings per
    share (“EPS”) until the price of our common stock
    exceeds the conversion price of $19.12 per share because the
    principal amount of the Senior Notes will be settled in cash
    upon conversion. Prior to conversion, we will include the effect
    of the additional shares that may be issued if our common stock
    price exceeds $19.12 per share using the treasury stock method.
    As a result, for the first $1.00 by which the average price of
    our common stock for a quarterly period exceeds $19.12 per share
    there would be dilution of approximately 5.4 million
    shares. As the share price continues to increase, additional
    dilution would occur at a declining rate such that an average
    price of $27.3175 per share would yield cumulative dilution of
    approximately 32.9 million shares. If the average price of
    our common stock exceeds $27.3175 per share for a quarterly
    period we will also include the effect of the additional
    potential shares that may be issued related to the warrants
    using the treasury stock method. The Senior Notes along with the
    warrants have a combined dilutive effect such that for the first
    $1.00 by which the average price exceeds $27.3175 per share
    there would be cumulative dilution of approximately
    39.5 million shares prior to conversion. As the share price
    continues to increase, additional dilution would occur but at a
    declining rate.

Prior to conversion, the note hedge transactions are not
    considered for purposes of the EPS calculation, as their effect
    would be anti-dilutive. Upon conversion, the note hedge will
    automatically serve to neutralize the dilutive effect of the
    Senior Notes when the stock price is above $19.12 per share. For
    example, if upon conversion the price of our common stock was
    $28.3175 per share, the cumulative effect of approximately
    39.5 million shares in the example above would be reduced
    to approximately 3.9 million shares.

The preceding calculations assume that the average price of our
    common stock exceeds the respective conversion prices during the
    period for which EPS is calculated and excludes any potential
    adjustments to the

conversion ratio provided under the terms of the Senior Notes.
    See Note 14 for information regarding the impact on EPS of
    the Senior Notes and warrants in the current period.

Revolving
    credit facility

In July 2006, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior
    unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in July 2011.
    Borrowings under the facility bear interest, at our option, at
    either a rate equal to the bank’s base rate or a rate equal
    to LIBOR plus a margin based on our leverage ratio, as defined
    in the credit facility agreement. In connection with the credit
    facility, we must maintain certain covenants, including a
    specified ratio of debt to earnings (before interest, taxes,
    depreciation, amortization and impairments) as well as various
    other non-financial covenants. As of April 2, 2010, we were
    in compliance with all required covenants, and there was no
    outstanding balance on the credit facility.

Note 8.

Restructuring

Upon approval of a restructuring plan by management with the
    appropriate level of authority, we record restructuring
    liabilities in accordance with the authoritative guidance.
    Liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal
    activity are recognized when the liability is incurred, as
    opposed to when management commits to an exit plan. In addition,
    (i) liabilities associated with exit and disposal
    activities are measured at fair value; (ii) one-time
    termination benefits are expensed at the date the entity
    notifies the employee, unless the employee must provide future
    service, in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over
    the future service period; and (iii) costs to terminate a
    contract before the end of its term are recognized when the
    entity terminates the contract in accordance with the contract
    terms. In addition, a portion of the restructuring costs related
    to international employees whose termination benefits are
    recognized when the amount of such termination benefits becomes
    estimable and payment is probable. We record other costs
    associated with exit activities as they are incurred.

Our restructuring costs and liabilities consist of severance,
    benefits, facilities and other costs. Severance and benefits
    generally include severance, outplacement services, health
    insurance coverage, effects of foreign currency exchange and
    legal costs. Facilities costs generally include rent expense,
    less expected sublease income and lease termination costs. Other
    costs generally include the effects of foreign currency exchange
    and consulting services. Also included in Restructuring in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations are transition and
    transformation fees, consulting services, and other costs
    related to the outsourcing of back office functions.
    Restructuring expenses are included in the Other reporting
    segment.

Charges for restructuring costs were $94 million,
    $96 million, and $74 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. These amounts include transition,
    transformation, consulting costs and related other costs of
    $28 million and $21 million for fiscal 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. There were no transition, transformation,
    consulting costs and related other costs in fiscal 2008.
    Transition and transformation related activities are expected to
    be substantially completed in fiscal 2011. Total remaining costs
    for transition and transformation activities are estimated to
    range from approximately $10 million to $20 million.

Restructuring
    Plans

The following details restructuring plans that management has
    committed to and are not substantially completed:

    Restructuring Plan (“2010 Plan”)

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, management approved and
    initiated the following restructuring events to:

•

Reduce operating costs through a workforce
    realignment

.  This action was initiated to more
    appropriately allocate resources to the Company’s key
    strategic initiatives. Charges related to this action are for
    severance



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

and benefits. These actions are expected to be substantially
    completed in fiscal 2011. Total remaining costs for severance
    and benefits are estimated to range from $45 million to
    $65 million.

•

Reduce operating costs through a facilities
    consolidation.

This action was initiated to
    streamline our operations and deliver better and more efficient
    support to our customers and employees. Charges related to this
    action are for consolidating certain facilities in North America
    and Europe. These actions are expected to be substantially
    completed in fiscal 2011. Total remaining costs for facilities
    are estimated to range from $35 million to $45 million.

    Restructuring Plan (“2008 Plan”)

In the third quarter of fiscal 2008, management approved and
    initiated the following restructuring events to:

•

Reduce operating costs through a worldwide headcount
    reduction

.  This action was initiated in the third
    quarter of fiscal 2008 and was substantially completed in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Charges related to this action
    are for severance and benefits. Total remaining costs are not
    expected to be significant.

•

Reduce operating costs, implement management structure
    changes, optimize the business structure and discontinue certain
    products.

Charges related to these actions are
    for severance and benefits. These actions were initiated in the
    third quarter of fiscal 2008 and are expected to be completed by
    the end of the second quarter in fiscal 2011. Total remaining
    costs for the severance and benefits are estimated to be up to
    $5 million.

•

Outsource certain back office functions
    worldwide.

Charges related to these actions are
    primarily for severance and benefits. These actions were
    initiated in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and are expected
    to be substantially completed in fiscal 2011. Total remaining
    costs for severance and benefits are expected to range from
    $5 million to $10 million.

Prior
    and Acquisition-related Plans

Prior
    Restructuring Plan

In fiscal 2009, management approved and initiated a plan to
    reduce operating costs through a worldwide headcount reduction.
    This action was initiated and substantially completed in fiscal
    2010. Charges related to this action were for severance and
    benefits. Total remaining costs are not expected to be
    significant.

Acquisition-related
    Plan

As a result of business acquisitions, management may deem
    certain job functions to be redundant and facilities to be in
    excess either at the time of acquisition or for a period of time
    after the acquisition in conjunction with our integration
    efforts. For acquisitions made prior to fiscal 2010, such
    restructuring-related costs have generally been adjusted to
    goodwill to reflect changes in the purchase price of the
    respective acquisition. With the adoption of new authoritative
    guidance on business combinations, restructuring charges related
    to our business acquisitions starting in fiscal 2010 are
    expensed in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of
    April 2, 2010, acquisition-related restructuring
    liabilities, primarily related to excess facility obligations at
    several locations around the world, are expected to be paid over
    the respective lease terms, the longest of which extends through
    fiscal 2018.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Lease
    Commitments

We lease certain of our facilities and related equipment under
    operating leases that expire at various dates through 2029. We
    currently sublease some space under various operating leases
    that will expire on various dates through 2018. Some of our
    leases contain renewal options, escalation clauses, rent
    concessions, and leasehold improvement incentives. Rent expense
    was $88 million, $88 million, and $87 million in
    fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

As of April 2, 2010, our future commitments and sublease

Purchase
    Obligations

We have purchase obligations of $421 million as of
    April 2, 2010 that are associated with agreements for
    purchases of goods or services. Management believes that
    cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and we expect to
    make future cash payments according to the contract terms.

Indemnification

As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we
    indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or
    occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at
    our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of
    future payments we could be required to make under these
    indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have
    directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage that
    reduces our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of
    any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of
    these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable
    insurance coverage is minimal.

We provide limited product warranties and the majority of our
    software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify
    licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from
    claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual
    property rights of a third party. Historically, payments made
    under these provisions have been immaterial. We monitor the
    conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a
    loss has occurred.

Litigation
    Contingencies

For a discussion of our pending tax litigation with the Internal
    Revenue Service relating to the 2000 and 2001 tax years of
    Veritas, see Note 13.

On July 7, 2004, a purported class action complaint
    entitled Paul Kuck, et al. v. Veritas Software Corporation,
    et al. was filed in the United States District Court for the
    District of Delaware. The lawsuit alleges violations of federal
    securities laws in connection with Veritas’ announcement on
    July 6, 2004 that it expected results of operations for the
    fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2004 to fall below earlier
    estimates. The complaint generally seeks an unspecified amount
    of damages. Subsequently, additional purported class action
    complaints have been filed in Delaware federal court, and, on
    March 3, 2005, the Court entered an order consolidating
    these actions and appointing lead plaintiffs and counsel. A
    consolidated amended complaint (“CAC”), was filed on
    May 27, 2005, expanding the class period from
    April 23, 2004 through July 6, 2004. The CAC also
    named another officer as a defendant and added allegations that
    Veritas and the named officers made false or misleading
    statements in press releases and SEC filings regarding the
    company’s financial results, which allegedly contained
    revenue recognized from contracts that were unsigned or lacked
    essential terms. The defendants to this matter filed a motion to
    dismiss the CAC in July 2005; the motion was denied in May 2006.
    In April 2008, the parties filed a stipulation of settlement. On
    July 31, 2008, the Court held a final approval hearing and,
    on August 5, 2008, the Court entered an order approving the
    settlement. An objector to the fees portion of the settlement
    has lodged an appeal. In fiscal 2008, we recorded an accrual in
    the amount of $21.5 million for this matter and, pursuant
    to the terms of the settlement, we established a settlement fund
    of $21.5 million on May 1, 2008.

We are also involved in a number of other judicial and
    administrative proceedings that are incidental to our business.
    Although adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur in one or
    more of the cases, it is not possible to estimate the possible
    loss or losses from each of these cases. The final resolution of
    these lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, is not
    expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition or results of operations.

Note 11.

Segment
    Information

During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we modified our segment
    reporting structure to more readily match our operating
    structure. The following modifications were made to our segment
    reporting structure: (i) Enterprise Vault products moved to
    the Storage and Server Management segment from the Security and
    Compliance segment; and (ii) Software-as-a-Service
    (“SaaS”) offerings moved to either the Security and
    Compliance segment or the Storage and Server Management segment
    from the Services segment, based on the nature of the service
    delivered. There were no changes to the Consumer or Other
    segments. The new reporting structure more directly aligns the
    operating segments with our markets and customers, and we
    believe it will establish more direct lines of reporting
    responsibilities, expedite decision making, and enhance the
    ability to pursue product integration and strategic growth
    opportunities. Data shown from the prior periods has been
    reclassified to match the current reporting structure. As of
    April 2, 2010, our five operating segments are:

•

Consumer.

Our Consumer segment focuses on
    delivering our Internet security, PC

tune-up,

and
    backup products to individual users and home offices.

•

Security and Compliance.

Our Security and
    Compliance segment focuses on providing large, medium, and
    small-sized businesses with solutions for endpoint security and
    management, compliance, messaging management, and data loss
    prevention solutions. These products allow our customers to
    secure, provision, and remotely access their laptops, PCs,
    mobile devices, and servers. We also provide our customers with
    services delivered through our SaaS security offerings.

•

Storage and Server Management.

Our Storage and
    Server Management segment focuses on providing large, medium and
    small-sized businesses with storage and server management,
    backup, archiving, and data protection solutions across
    heterogeneous storage and server platforms, as well as services
    delivered through our SaaS offerings.

•

Services.

Our Services segment provides
    customers with implementation services and solutions designed to
    assist them in maximizing the value of their Symantec software.
    Our offerings include consulting, business critical services,
    education, and managed security services.

•

Other.

Our Other segment is comprised of
    sunset products and products nearing the end of their life
    cycle. It also includes general and administrative expenses;
    amortization of acquired product rights, intangible assets, and
    other assets; goodwill impairment charges; charges such as
    stock-based compensation and restructuring; and certain indirect
    costs that are not charged to the other operating segments. Our
    provision for income taxes, loss from joint venture, and
    non-operating items, such as interest income and interest
    expense, are also allocated to this segment.



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
    described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
    There are no intersegment sales. Our chief operating decision
    maker evaluates performance primarily based on net revenue.
    Except for goodwill, as disclosed in Note 5, the majority
    of our assets are not discretely identified by segment. The
    depreciation and amortization of our property, equipment, and
    leasehold improvements are allocated based on headcount, unless
    specifically identified by segment.

    Revenue from Ingram Micro is included in our Security and
    Compliance, Storage and Server Management and Services segments.
    Our distributor arrangements with Ingram Micro consist of
    several non-exclusive, independently negotiated agreements with
    its subsidiaries, each of which cover different countries or
    regions. Each of these agreements is separately negotiated and
    is independent of any other contract (such as a master
    distribution agreement), and these agreements are not based on
    the same form of contract. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, one
    reseller, Digital River accounted for 10% and 11% of our total
    net revenues, respectively. Revenue from Digital River is
    included in our Consumer segment. In fiscal 2010, we launched a
    new, internally-developed eCommerce platform, which will reduce
    our reliance on Digital River.

401(k)
    plan

We maintain a salary deferral 401(k) plan for all of our
    domestic employees. This plan allows employees to contribute up
    to 50% of their pretax salary up to the maximum dollar
    limitation prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. We match 50%
    of the employee’s contribution. The maximum match in any
    given plan year is 3% of the employees’ eligible
    compensation, up to $6,000. Our contributions under the plan
    were $22 million, $20 million, and $24 million,
    in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

    purchase plans

    Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In September 2008, our stockholders approved the 2008 Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (“2008 ESPP”) and reserved
    20 million shares of common stock for issuance thereunder.
    As of April 2, 2010, 16 million shares remain
    available for issuance under the 2008 ESPP.

Subject to certain limitations, our employees may elect to have
    2% to 10% of their compensation withheld through payroll
    deductions to purchase shares of common stock under the 2008
    ESPP. Employees purchase shares of common stock at a price per
    share equal to 85% of the fair market value on the purchase date
    at the end of each six-month purchase period.

    Executive Officers’ Stock Purchase Plan

In September 2002, our stockholders approved the 2002 Executive
    Officers’ Stock Purchase Plan and reserved
    250,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder,
    which was amended by our Board of Directors in January 2008. The
    purpose of the plan is to provide executive officers with a
    means to acquire an equity interest in Symantec at fair market
    value by applying a portion or all of their respective bonus
    payments towards the purchase price. As of April 2, 2010,
    40,401 shares have been issued under the plan and
    209,599 shares remain available for future issuance. Shares
    reserved for issuance under this plan have not been adjusted for
    the stock dividends.

2000 Director
    Equity Incentive Plan

In September 2000, our stockholders approved the
    2000 Director Equity Incentive Plan and reserved
    50,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder.
    Stockholders increased the number of shares of stock that may be
    issued by 50,000 in both September 2004 and September 2007. The
    purpose of this plan is to provide the members of the Board of
    Directors with an opportunity to receive common stock for all or
    a portion of the retainer payable to each director for serving
    as a member. Each director may elect any portion up to 100% of
    the retainer to be paid in the form of stock. As of
    April 2, 2010, a total of 109,881 shares had been
    issued under this plan and 40,119 shares remained available
    for future issuance.

    Equity Incentive Plan

Under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, (“2004 Plan”)
    our Board of Directors, or a committee of the Board of
    Directors, may grant incentive and nonqualified stock options,
    stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units
    (“RSUs”), or restricted stock awards
    (“RSAs”) to employees, officers, directors,
    consultants, independent contractors, and advisors to us, or to
    any parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of ours. The purpose of the
    2004 Plan is to attract, retain, and motivate eligible persons
    whose present and potential contributions are important to our
    success by offering them an opportunity to participate in our
    future performance through equity awards of stock options and
    stock bonuses. Under the terms of the 2004 Plan, the exercise
    price of stock options may not be less than 100% of the fair
    market value on the date of grant. Options generally vest over a
    four-year period. Options granted prior to October 2005
    generally have a maximum term of ten years and options granted
    thereafter generally have a maximum term of seven years.

As of April 2, 2010, we have reserved 132 million
    shares for issuance under the 2004 Plan. These shares include
    18 million shares originally reserved for issuance under
    the 2004 Plan upon its adoption by our stockholders in September
    2004, 24 million shares that were transferred to the 2004
    Plan from the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan, (“1996
    Plan”), and 40 million and 50 million shares that
    were approved for issuance on the amendment and restatement of
    the 2004 Plan at our 2006 and 2008 annual meeting of
    stockholders, respectively. In addition to the shares currently
    reserved under the 2004 Plan, any shares reacquired by us from
    options outstanding under the 1996

Plan upon their cancellation will also be added to the 2004 Plan
    reserve. As of April 2, 2010, 59 million shares remain
    available for future grant under the 2004 Plan.

Assumed
    Vontu stock options

In connection with our fiscal 2008 acquisition of Vontu, we
    assumed all unexercised, outstanding options to purchase Vontu
    common stock. Each unexercised, outstanding option assumed was
    converted into an option to purchase Symantec common stock after
    applying the exchange ratio of 0.5351 shares of Symantec
    common stock for each share of Vontu common stock. In total, all
    unexercised, outstanding Vontu options were converted into
    options to purchase approximately 2.2 million shares of
    Symantec common stock. As of April 2, 2010, total
    unrecognized compensation cost adjusted for estimated
    forfeitures related to unexercised, outstanding Vontu stock
    options was approximately $2 million.

Furthermore, all shares obtained upon exercise of unvested Vontu
    options were converted into the right to receive cash of $9.33
    per share upon vesting. The total value of the assumed
    exercised, unvested Vontu options on the date of acquisition was
    approximately $7 million, assuming no options are forfeited
    prior to vesting. As of April 2, 2010, total unrecognized
    compensation cost adjusted for estimated forfeitures related to
    exercised, unvested Vontu stock options was immaterial.

The assumed options retained all applicable terms and vesting
    periods, except for certain options that were accelerated
    according to a change in control provision and will generally
    vest within a twelve month period from the date of acquisition
    and certain other options that vested in full as of the
    acquisition date. In general, the assumed options typically vest
    over a period of four years from the original date of grant of
    the option and have a maximum term of ten years.

Other
    stock option plans

Options remain outstanding under several other stock option
    plans, including the 2001 Non-Qualified Equity Incentive Plan,
    the 1999 Acquisition Plan, the 1996 Plan, and various plans
    assumed in connection with acquisitions. No further options may
    be granted under any of these plans.

Valuation
    of stock-based awards

The fair value of each stock option granted under our equity
    incentive plans is estimated on the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
    weighted-average assumptions:

Changes in the Black-Scholes valuation assumptions and our

    compensation expense due to changes in our valuation assumptions
    of stock-based awards.

Of the $67 million total valuation allowance provided
    against our deferred tax assets, approximately $55 million
    is attributable to acquisition-related assets. The valuation
    allowance decreased by $35 million in fiscal 2010, of which
    $34 million was attributable to the release of Irish
    deferred tax assets related to our Veritas

2000-2001

court case decision, current year utilization, and a favorable
    change in our ability to use deferred tax assets on our tax
    returns; and $2 million was attributable to
    acquisition-related assets, offset by a $1 million increase
    attributable to capital losses.

As of April 2, 2010, we have U.S. federal net
    operating losses attributable to various acquired companies of
    approximately $137 million, which, if not used, will expire
    between fiscal 2011 and 2029. These net operating loss
    carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Internal
    Revenue Code § 382, but are expected to be fully
    realized. Furthermore, we have U.S. state net operating
    loss and credit carryforwards attributable to various acquired
    companies of approximately $233 million and
    $14 million, respectively, which will expire in various
    fiscal years. In addition, we have foreign net operating loss
    carryforwards attributable to various acquired foreign companies
    of approximately $374 million net of valuation allowances,
    which, under current applicable foreign tax law, can be carried
    forward indefinitely.

As a result of the impairment of goodwill in fiscal year 2009,
    we have cumulative pre-tax book losses, as measured by the
    current and prior two years. We considered the negative evidence
    of this cumulative pre-tax book loss position on our ability to
    continue to recognize deferred tax assets that are dependent
    upon future taxable income for realization. We considered the
    following as positive evidence: the vast majority of the
    goodwill impairment is not deductible for tax purposes and thus
    will not result in tax losses; we have a strong, consistent
    taxpaying history; we have substantial U.S. federal income
    tax carryback potential; and we have substantial amounts of
    scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from
    our deferred tax liabilities. We have concluded that this
    positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and, thus,
    that the deferred tax assets as of April 2, 2010 of
    $519 million, after application of the valuation
    allowances, are realizable on a “more likely than not”
    basis.

As of April 2, 2010, no provision has been made for federal
    or state income taxes on $1.8 billion of cumulative
    unremitted earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries since
    we plan to indefinitely reinvest these earnings. As of
    April 2, 2010, the unrecognized deferred tax liability for
    these earnings was $524 million.

The Company adopted the provisions of new authoritative guidance
    on income taxes, effective March 31, 2007. The cumulative
    effect of adopting this new guidance was a decrease in tax
    reserves of $16 million, resulting in a decrease to Veritas
    goodwill of $10 million, an increase of $5 million to
    the March 31, 2007 Accumulated earnings balance, and a
    $1 million increase in Additional paid-in capital. Upon
    adoption, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits as
    of March 31, 2007 was $456 million, exclusive of
    interest and penalties.

Of the $90 million of changes in gross unrecognized tax
    benefits during the fiscal year as disclosed above,
    approximately $1 million was provided through purchase
    accounting in connection with acquisitions during fiscal 2010.
    This gross liability is reduced by offsetting tax benefits
    associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer
    pricing adjustments, interest deductions, and state income
    taxes, as well as payments made to date.

Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at April 2, 2010,
    $535 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the
    Company’s effective tax rate, while $8 million would
    affect the cumulative translation adjustments. However, one or
    more of these unrecognized tax benefits could be subject to a
    valuation allowance if and when recognized in a future period,
    which could impact the timing of any related effective tax rate
    benefit.

Our policy to include interest and penalties related to gross
    unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes
    did not change upon the adoption of the new authoritative
    guidance on income taxes. At April 2, 2010, before any tax
    benefits, we had $102 million of accrued interest and
    accrued penalties on unrecognized tax benefits. Interest
    included in our provision for income taxes was a benefit of
    approximately $34 million for the year ended April 2,
    2010. If the accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately
    become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced in the period
    that such determination is made, and reflected as a reduction of
    the overall income tax provision.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. on a federal basis
    and in many U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two
    most significant tax jurisdictions are the U.S. and
    Ireland. Our tax filings remain subject to examination by
    applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time
    following the tax year to which those filings relate. Our 2000
    through 2009 tax years remain subject to examination by the
    Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for U.S. federal
    tax purposes, and our 2006 through 2009 fiscal years remain
    subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies
    for Irish tax purposes. Other significant jurisdictions include
    California, Japan, the UK and India. As of

April 2, 2010, we are under examination by the IRS,
    regarding Veritas U.S. federal income taxes for the 2002
    through 2005 tax years and Symantec U.S. federal income
    taxes for the fiscal years 2005 through 2008 tax years. In
    addition, we are under examination by the California Franchise
    Tax Board for the Symantec California income taxes for the 2004
    through 2005 tax years. We are also under audit by the Indian
    income tax authorities for fiscal years 2006 through 2007,
    respectively.

We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing income tax
    controversies and the impact, if any, of the expected tolling of
    the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.
    Considering these facts, we believe there is a reasonable
    possibility of significant changes to our total unrecognized tax
    benefits within the next twelve months.

On May 27, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    Ninth Circuit overturned a 2005 U.S. Tax Court ruling in

Xilinx v. Commissioner

, holding that stock-based
    compensation related to research and development
    (“R&D”) must be shared by the participants of a
    R&D cost sharing arrangement. The Ninth Circuit held that
    related parties to such an arrangement must share stock option
    costs, notwithstanding the U.S. Tax Court’s finding
    that unrelated parties in such an arrangement would not share
    such costs. Symantec has a similar R&D cost sharing
    arrangement in place. The Ninth Circuit’s reversal of the
    U.S. Tax Court’s decision changed our estimate of
    stock option related tax benefits previously recognized under
    the authoritative guidance on income taxes. As a result of the
    Ninth Circuit’s ruling, we increased our liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits, recording a tax expense of
    approximately $7 million and a reduction of additional
    paid-in capital of approximately $30 million in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2010. On January 13, 2010, the Ninth
    Circuit Court of Appeals withdrew its issued opinion. On
    March 22, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a
    revised decision affirming the decision of the Tax Court. The
    Ninth Circuit’s revised decision agreed with the Tax
    Court’s finding that related companies are not required to
    share such costs. As a result of the Ninth Circuit’s
    revised ruling, we released the liability established in the
    first quarter of fiscal 2010, which resulted in a
    $7 million tax benefit and increase of additional paid-in
    capital of approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2010. For fiscal 2010, there was no net income tax
    expense impact.

On March 29, 2006, we received a Notice of Deficiency from
    the IRS claiming that we owe $867 million of additional
    taxes, excluding interest and penalties, for the 2000 and 2001
    tax years based on an audit of Veritas. On June 26, 2006,
    we filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court protesting the
    IRS claim for such additional taxes. During July 2008, we
    completed the trial phase of the Tax Court case, which dealt
    with the remaining issue covered in the assessment. At trial,
    the IRS changed its position with respect to this remaining
    issue, which decreased the remaining amount at issue from
    $832 million to $545 million, excluding interest. We
    filed our post-trial briefs in October 2008 and rebuttal briefs
    in November 2008 with the U.S. Tax Court.

On December 10, 2009, the U.S. Tax Court issued its
    opinion, finding that our transfer pricing methodology, with
    appropriate adjustments, was the best method for assessing the
    value of the transaction at issue between Veritas and its
    offshore subsidiary. The Tax Court judge provided guidance as to
    how adjustments would be made to correct the application of the
    method used by Veritas. We remeasured and decreased our
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits accordingly, resulting
    in a $78.5 million tax benefit in the third quarter of
    fiscal 2010. Final computations as directed by the Ruling are
    not complete and, accordingly, we may make further adjustments
    to our tax liability in the future. The Tax Court ruling is
    subject to appeal. We have $110 million on deposit with the
    IRS pertaining to this matter.

On December 2, 2009, we received a Revenue Agent’s
    Report from the IRS for the Veritas 2002 through 2005 tax years
    assessing additional taxes due. We agree with $30 million
    of the tax assessment, excluding interest, but will contest the
    other $80 million of tax assessed and all penalties. The
    unagreed issues concern transfer pricing matters comparable to
    the one that was resolved in our favor in the

Veritas v.
    Commissioner

Tax Court decision. On January 15, 2010,
    we filed a protest with the IRS in connection with the
    $80 million of tax assessed.

In July 2008, we reached an agreement with the IRS concerning
    our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made
    from a Veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the July 2005
    acquisition. The distribution was intended to be made pursuant
    to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and therefore
    eligible for a 5.25% effective

    rate. The final impact of this agreement is not yet known since
    this relates to the taxability of earnings that are otherwise
    the subject of the tax years

transfer pricing dispute, which in turn is being addressed in
    the U.S. Tax Court. To the extent that we owe taxes as a
    result of the transfer pricing dispute, we anticipate that the
    incremental tax due from this negotiated agreement will
    decrease. We currently estimate that the most probable outcome
    from this negotiated agreement will be that we will owe
    $13 million or less, for which an accrual has already been
    made. We made a payment of $130 million to the IRS for this
    matter in May 2006. We applied $110 million of this payment
    as a deposit on the outstanding transfer pricing matter for the
    tax years

2000-2004.

Note 14.

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed on the basis
    of the weighted average number of shares of common stock
    outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share also
    includes the incremental effect of dilutive potential common
    shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock
    method. Dilutive potential common shares include shares
    underlying outstanding stock options, stock awards, warrants,
    and convertible notes.

The components of earnings per share are as follows:

For these fiscal years, the effects of the warrants issued and

    Notes were excluded because, as discussed in Note 8, they
    have no impact on diluted earnings per share until our average
    stock price for the applicable period reaches $27.3175 per share
    and $19.12 per share, respectively.

Subsequent
    Events

In April 2010, we signed definitive agreements to acquire PGP
    Corporation (“PGP”) and GuardianEdge Technologies,
    Inc. (“GuardianEdge”), privately-held US-based
    providers of email and data encryption services. We expect to
    acquire PGP and GuardianEdge for a purchase price of
    approximately $300 million and $70 million in cash,
    respectively. The acquisitions are expected to close by the end
    of the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and therefore a disclosure
    of the purchase price allocation cannot be made at this time.

In April 2010, we announced our strategy for the Consulting
    Services business to expand our partner eco-system to better
    leverage their customer reach and operational scale. As a result
    of this change in strategy, we expect to take a restructuring
    charge in the range of $40 million to $50 million
    during fiscal 2011. The Consulting Services business is included
    in the Services segment in this annual report.

On May 19, 2010, we signed a definitive agreement to
    acquire certain assets of VeriSign, Inc. (“VeriSign”),
    a publicly-held US-based provider of internet authentication and
    domain naming services. The acquired assets relate to the
    authentication business of VeriSign. As part of the agreement,
    we will also acquire VeriSign’s 54% interest in VeriSign
    Japan KK. We anticipate a purchase price of approximately
    $1.28 billion to be paid in cash related to this
    acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approvals and other
    closing conditions. We expect the acquisition to close during
    the second quarter of our fiscal 2011.
