PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Symantec is a global leader of security, storage and systems
    management solutions to help businesses and consumers secure and
    manage their information. We conduct our business in three
    geographic regions: Americas, which includes United States,
    Canada, and Latin America; EMEA, which includes Europe, the
    Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific Japan (“APJ”).

Our delivery network includes direct, inside, and channel sales
    resources that support our ecosystem of more than 40,000
    partners worldwide, as well as various relationships with
    original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), Internet
    service providers (“ISPs”), and retail and online
    stores. We provide customers worldwide with software and
    services that protect, manage and control information risks
    related to security, backup and recovery, storage, compliance,
    and systems management.

Founded in 1982, Symantec has operations in more than 40
    countries and our principal executive offices are located at
    20330 Stevens Creek Blvd., Cupertino, California 95014. Our
    telephone number at that location is

(408) 517-8000.

Our home page on the Internet is

www.symantec.com.

Other
    than the information expressly set forth in this annual report,
    the information contained, or referred to, on our website is not
    part of this annual report.

Strategy

Symantec’s strategy is to provide software and services to
    secure and manage the connected, information-driven world of our
    customers against more risks at more points, more completely and
    efficiently than any other company. We help individuals, small
    businesses, and global organizations ensure that their
    information, technology infrastructures and related processes
    are protected, managed easily and controlled automatically,
    independent of devices, platforms or locations.

We operate primarily in three diversified markets within the
    software sector: security, storage and systems management. The
    security market includes mission-critical products that protect
    consumers and enterprises from threats to electronic
    information, endpoint devices, and computer networks. Over the
    past year, we have seen a continued rise in the volume of
    security threats. Whereas attackers used to mass-distribute a
    threat to thousands or millions of targeted machines,
    today’s attackers often send individually crafted attacks
    to each victim. Attackers are also targeting users with
    social-engineering attacks, such as phishing websites that steal
    financial information, passwords and other personal data. The
    Internet has become the primary conduit for attack activity with
    hackers funneling threats through legitimate websites, placing a
    much larger percentage of the population at risk than in the
    past. Security continues to be a top priority for enterprises as
    information security is increasingly linked to regulatory
    compliance.

The storage software market includes products that manage,
    archive, backup, and recover business-critical data. Key drivers
    of demand in this market include the increasing volume of
    information that organizations of all sizes must manage, which
    is doubling every two years, the need for data to be protected
    and accessible at all times, and the need for a growing number
    of critical applications to be continuously available. Other
    factors driving demand in this market include the increasing
    pressure on companies to lower storage and server management
    costs while simultaneously increasing the utilization,
    availability levels, and performance of their existing
    information technology (“IT”) infrastructure.

The systems management market includes products that control the
    IT environment by streamlining efforts associated with
    deploying, managing, patching and remediating enterprise client
    and server assets. The drivers for demand in this market include
    customers’ desire to automate management tasks, to ensure
    business productivity and to reduce IT costs and complexity.

We believe that the security, storage and systems management
    software markets are converging as customers increasingly
    require our help in mitigating their risk profiles and managing
    their storage solutions in order to secure and manage their most
    valuable asset — their information. As the tools and
    processes from these formerly discrete



domains become more integrated, we have taken a more proactive
    and policy-driven approach to protecting and managing
    information throughout its lifetime.

Business
    Developments and Highlights

During fiscal 2009, we took the following actions to support our
    business:

•

We launched several new products and integrated new features
    into our products. Some of the new offerings in our enterprise
    business include: advanced electronic discovery and data
    de-duplication capabilities in our industry leading archiving
    platform; increased ability to discover, monitor and protect
    confidential information wherever it is stored or used through
    our data loss prevention solution; end-to-end coverage for the
    IT compliance lifecycle, including policy management, technical
    and procedural controls assessment in our compliance solution;
    support for VMware and
    Microsoft

®

Hyper-V in our backup and recovery solution; offering better
    visibility into IT assets, simplified day-to-day manageability
    and improved end-user productivity in our systems management
    solutions; and workspace management in our endpoint
    virtualization solution. In our consumer business, we delivered
    more than 300 performance improvements to our 2009 security
    products while providing even stronger protection against
    web-based attacks and other security threats. In addition, we
    expanded our consumer portfolio to include new web-based
    offerings for

back-up

and
    family safety, and we launched a remote PC Help service.

•

We completed six acquisitions during fiscal 2009. We expanded
    our portfolio in the emerging and high growth areas of
    Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) and endpoint
    virtualization. In the SaaS space, we acquired MessageLabs Group
    Limited (“MessageLabs”). We also invested in our
    Consumer business by acquiring PC Tools Pty Ltd. (“PC
    Tools”) and SwapDrive, Inc. (“SwapDrive”). The PC
    Tools and SwapDrive acquisitions add new products, enhance our
    product portfolio with additional features and capabilities as
    well as help us acquire new customers.

•

We reduced our cost structure in order to better align expenses
    with our revenue expectations. Some of the actions we took were:
    outsourcing certain IT and back-office finance functions;
    tightly managing our headcount costs; consolidating real-estate
    facilities; and reducing travel and entertainment expenses and
    other discretionary items.

•

We made the following key changes to our executive management
    team: we announced John Thompson’s retirement as Chief
    Executive Officer and announced the appointment of Enrique Salem
    as President and Chief Executive Officer, each effective
    April 4, 2009, the first day of our fiscal 2010. As of that
    date, Enrique Salem also joined our Board of Directors and John
    Thompson remains the Chairman of the Board.

•

We repurchased 42 million shares of our common stock for an
    aggregate amount of $700 million.

Operating
    Segments and Products

Our operating segments are significant strategic business units
    that offer different products and services, distinguished by
    customer needs. During fiscal 2009, we had five operating
    segments: Consumer, Security and Compliance, Storage and Server
    Management, Services, and Other.

Consumer

Our Consumer segment provides suites and services that include
    Internet security, PC tuneup, and backup for individual users
    and home offices. Our
    Norton

tm

brand of consumer security software products provides protection
    for
    Windows

®

,

    Macintosh

®

,

    Windows-Mobile

®

,

    and
    Symbian

tm

platforms.

New customer acquisition is driven by increased threats, the
    need for identity protection, the growth of online transactions
    and the rapid increase of consumer data, such as photos, music
    libraries and video. Our award-winning Norton 2009 releases set
    a new standard for speed and performance. We continue to acquire
    customers through a diversified channel strategy that places our
    products where customers want to buy, including most of the top
    OEMs and through our number one position in retail. With the
    acquisition of PC Tools, Symantec reaches more segments, such as
    emerging markets, price sensitive consumers and new

e-commerce

channels.



Norton retains and leverages its strong existing customer base
    through auto-renewal subscriptions, migrating customers from
    point products to multi-product suites such as Norton Internet
    Security and Norton 360 and selling them additional products or
    services such as NortonLive services or the new Norton Online
    Backup. Through Norton 360, various partnerships and online
    channels, we are the market leader for online backup. Symantec
    hosts over 30 petabytes of consumers’ data and we have more
    than 7 million customers.

Symantec continued improving its consumer customer experience,
    satisfaction and loyalty during fiscal 2009. Our primary
    consumer products are: Norton

tm

,

    Norton Internet
    Security

tm

,

    and Norton AntiVirus.

Security
    and Compliance

Our Security and Compliance segment helps our customers
    standardize, automate and reduce the costs of day-to-day
    security activities in order to secure and manage their
    information.

Our primary solutions in this segment address the following
    areas:

Enterprise
    Security

Enterprise security customer demand is driven by the quickly
    evolving threat environment, compliance regulations, and the
    need to keep confidential information from exposure outside the
    organization. Our solutions are built on market-leading policy
    management, data loss prevention, endpoint security, antispam,
    and content filtering technologies, allowing IT professionals to
    proactively mitigate information security risks and policy
    violations. We also help customers define, control, and govern
    their IT policies from a central location. This enables
    customers to protect critical assets and reduce business risk.
    Products include Symantec Endpoint Protection, Symantec Data
    Loss Prevention, Control Compliance Suite and Symantec
    Brightmail Gateway.

Endpoint
    Management

Our Endpoint Management business consisting of our systems
    management products is driven by the need for automated asset
    management, patch management and remediation. Our solutions
    offer better visibility into IT assets, simplified day-to-day
    manageability and improved end-user productivity, helping
    customers realize cost savings and value from their existing IT
    investments. Another key demand driver is endpoint
    virtualization, which frees up critical information from the
    myriad of operating system functions and devices so it can be
    secured and managed. Our products include the Altiris Client
    Management Suite, Altiris Server Management Suite, Altiris Total
    Management Suite, and Symantec Endpoint Virtualization Suite.

Archiving

Growth in our archiving business is driven by increased

e-discovery

requirements and the growth of unstructured data such as email
    and instant messaging (“IM”). Symantec Enterprise
    Vault

tm

optimizes storage by reducing expensive long-term storage of
    this data in an easy to access format.

Storage
    and Server Management

Our Storage and Server Management segment focuses on providing
    enterprise customers with storage management, high availability,
    and backup and recovery solutions across heterogeneous storage
    and server platforms. These solutions enable companies to
    standardize on a single layer of infrastructure software that
    works on every major distributed operating system and supports
    every major storage device, database, and application.

Our primary storage and server management solutions address the
    following areas:

Storage
    Management and High Availability

Our Storage Management and High Availability business is driven
    by our customers’ need to reduce overall storage costs
    through improved utilization of existing systems and
    virtualization. The business is also driven by customer
    migration to x86 based servers, which provides a reliance on
    management and availability tools to manage complexity and
    provide business continuity. Our products help customers
    simplify their data centers by



standardizing storage management across their environment for
    more efficient use of their existing storage investment. They
    also enable enterprises to manage large storage environments and
    ensure the availability of critical applications. Products
    include Veritas Storage
    Foundation

tm

,

    Veritas CommandCentral Storage, and
    Veritas

tm

Cluster Server.

Backup
    and Recovery

Growth in the backup and recovery business is driven by
    migration from tape to disk-based backup, support for
    virtualization, de-duplication, and continuous data protection.
    The transition of NetBackup to a platform-based architecture
    enables our customers to take advantage of these drivers.
    Products include Veritas
    NetBackup

tm

,

    Veritas NetBackup
    PureDisk

tm

,

    Symantec Backup
    Exec

tm

,

    and Symantec Backup Exec System Recovery.

Services

Symantec Global Services help customers address information
    security, availability, storage, and compliance challenges at
    the endpoint and in complex, multi-vendor data center
    environments. Our Services segment delivers Consulting,
    Education and Business Critical Services that help our customers
    maximize the value of their investment in our products and
    solutions. Managed Services and SaaS offerings provide customers
    the additional choice of on-demand services to meet their IT
    requirements.

Consulting,
    Education and Business Critical Services

Symantec Consulting provides advisory, product enablement and
    residency services to enable customers to assess, design,
    transform and operate their infrastructure, leveraging Symantec
    products and solutions. Education Services provides a full range
    of programs, including technical training and security awareness
    training, to help customers optimize their Symantec solutions.
    Business Critical Services, our highest level of support,
    provides personalized, proactive support from technical experts
    for enterprises that require secure, uninterrupted access to
    their data and applications.

Managed
    Services and SaaS

Symantec Managed Services and SaaS offerings enable customers to
    place resource-intensive IT operations under the management of
    experienced Symantec specialists in order to optimize existing
    resources and focus on strategic IT projects. This helps
    customers by reducing IT complexity, managing IT risk, and
    lowering the cost of operations. Recently acquired SaaS
    offerings from MessageLabs, combined with our Symantec
    Protection Network backup and recovery offerings provide our
    customers the flexibility to manage their business using online
    services or hybrid onsite and in-the-cloud solutions. These
    services include Symantec Managed Security Services, Symantec
    Managed Backup and MessageLabs Email Security Solutions.

Sales and
    Go-To-Market Strategy

Consumer

We sell our consumer products and services to individuals and
    home offices globally through a multi-tiered network of
    distribution partners and through

e-commerce

channels. Our products are available to customers through
    distributors, retailers, direct marketers, Internet-based
    resellers, OEMs, system builders, and ISPs.



Sales in the Consumer business through our electronic
    distribution channel, which includes sales derived from OEMs,
    subscriptions, upgrades, online sales, and renewals, grew by
    $143 million in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008. During fiscal
    2009, approximately 79 percent of revenue in the Consumer
    segment came from our electronic channels.

Enterprise

We sell and market our products and related services to
    enterprise customers through our direct sales force of more than
    3,500 and through a variety of indirect sales channels, which
    include value-added resellers, large account resellers,
    distributors, and system integrators. We also sell our products
    through authorized distributors in more than 40 countries and
    OEM partners who incorporate our technologies into their
    products, bundle our products with their offerings, or serve as
    authorized resellers of our products. Our sales efforts are
    primarily targeted to senior executives and IT department
    personnel responsible for managing a company’s IT
    initiatives.

During fiscal 2009, we added a SaaS delivery model offering a
    pay-as-you-go model that meets the needs of enterprise and small
    and medium business with evolving storage and security
    requirements.

Marketing
    and Advertising

Our marketing expenditure relates primarily to advertising and
    promotion, which includes demand generation and brand
    recognition of our consumer and enterprise products. Our
    advertising and promotion efforts include, but are not limited
    to, electronic and print advertising, trade shows, collateral
    production, and all forms of direct marketing. We also invest in
    cooperative marketing campaigns with distributors, resellers,
    retailers, OEMs, and industry partners.

We invest in various retention marketing and customer loyalty
    programs to help drive renewals and encourage customer advocacy
    and referrals. We also provide focused vertical marketing
    programs in targeted industries and countries.

We typically offer two types of rebate programs within most
    countries: volume incentive rebates to channel partners and
    promotional rebates to distributors and end-users. Distributors
    and resellers earn volume incentive rebates primarily based upon
    product sales to end-users. We also offer rebates to individual
    users who purchase products through various resale channels. We
    regularly offer upgrade rebates to consumers purchasing a new
    version of a product. Both volume incentive rebates and end-user
    rebates are accrued as an offset to revenue.

Support

Symantec has centralized support facilities throughout the world
    that provide rapid, around-the-clock response, and are staffed
    by technical product experts knowledgeable in the operating
    environments in which our products are deployed. Our technical
    support experts assist customers with product implementation and
    usage, issue resolution and countermeasures, and threat
    detection.

Symantec provides customers various levels of enterprise support
    offerings. Our enterprise security support program offers annual
    maintenance support contracts, including content, upgrades, and
    technical support. Our standard technical support includes:
    unlimited hotline service delivered by telephone, fax, email,
    and over the Internet; immediate patches for severe problems;
    periodic software updates; and access to our technical knowledge
    base and frequently asked questions.

Our Consumer product support program provides self-help online
    services, phone, chat, email support and fee-based premium
    support and diagnostic services to consumers worldwide.
    Customers that subscribe to LiveUpdate receive automatic
    downloads of the latest virus definitions, application bug
    fixes, and patches for most of our consumer products.

Customers

In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, one reseller, Digital River
    accounted for 10%, 11% and 12%, respectively, of our total net
    revenues. Digital River represented the only customer that
    accounted for 10 percent or more of



revenues in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2008 and 2007, one
    distributor, Ingram Micro accounted for 10% and 11%,
    respectively, of our total net revenues. Our distributor
    arrangements with Ingram Micro consist of several non-exclusive,
    independently negotiated agreements with its subsidiaries, each
    of which cover different countries or regions. Each of these
    agreements is separately negotiated and is independent of any
    other contract (such as a master distribution agreement), and
    these agreements are not based on the same form of contract.
    None of these contracts were individually responsible for over
    10 percent of our total net revenues in fiscal 2008 and
    2007.

Research
    and Development

Research and development expenses, exclusive of in-process
    research and development associated with acquisitions, were
    $880 million, $894 million and $867 million in
    fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, representing
    approximately 14%, 15% and 17% of revenue in the respective
    periods. We believe that technical leadership is essential to
    our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial
    resources to research and development.

Symantec embraces a global R&D strategy to drive organic
    innovation across the company. Engineers throughout the company
    pursue advanced projects and work with our engineering centers,
    research labs, global services teams, and new business incubator
    to translate R&D into next-generation security, storage and
    systems management technologies. Symantec focuses on short,
    medium, and long-term applied research, develops new products in
    emerging areas, participates in government-funded research
    projects, and partners with universities to conduct research to
    support Symantec’s vision. Symantec holds more than 600
    global patents.

Our Security Response experts, located at research centers
    throughout the world, are focused on collecting and analyzing
    the latest malware threats, ranging from network security
    threats and vulnerabilities to viruses and worms. All this data
    is collected through the Symantec Global Intelligence Network,
    which provides insight into emerging trends in attacks,
    malicious code activity, phishing, spam, and other threats. This
    hands-on expertise is further leveraged in developing new
    technologies and approaches to protecting customers’
    information and systems.

Acquisitions

Our strategic technology acquisitions are designed to enhance
    the features and functionality of our existing products, and
    extend our product leadership, as well as to expand into
    emerging businesses such as SaaS and endpoint virtualization. We
    consider time to market, synergies with existing products, and
    potential market share gains when evaluating acquisitions of
    technologies, product lines, or companies. We may acquire

and/or

dispose of other technologies, products and companies in the
    future.

Competition

Our markets are consolidating, highly competitive, and subject
    to rapid changes in technology. We are focused on integrating
    next generation technology capabilities into our solution set in
    order to differentiate ourselves from the competition. We
    believe that the principal competitive factors necessary to be
    successful in our industry also include, time to market, price,
    reputation, financial stability, breadth of product offerings,
    customer support, brand recognition, and effective sales and
    marketing efforts.

In addition to the competition we face from direct competitors,
    we face indirect or potential competition from retail,
    application providers, operating system providers, network
    equipment manufacturers, and other OEMs, who may provide various
    solutions and functions in their current and future products. We
    also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for
    the attention of customers at the retail level and in corporate
    accounts. In addition, we compete with other software companies,
    operating system providers, network equipment manufacturers and
    other OEMs to acquire technologies, products, or companies and
    to publish software developed by third parties. We also compete
    with other software companies in our effort to place our
    products on the computer equipment sold to consumers by OEMs.

The competitive environments in which each segment operates are
    described below.

Consumer

Some of the channels in which our consumer products are offered
    are highly competitive. Our competitors are intensely focused on
    customer acquisition, which has led such competitors to offer
    their technology for free, engage in aggressive marketing, or
    enter into competitive partnerships. Our primary competitors in
    the Consumer segment are Kaspersky Lab, McAfee, Inc.
    (“McAfee”), Microsoft Corporation
    (“Microsoft”), and Trend Micro Inc. (“Trend
    Micro”). There are also several smaller regional security
    companies that we compete against primarily in the EMEA and APJ
    regions. For our consumer backup offerings, our primary
    competitors are Mozy, Inc. (“Mozy”), acquired by EMC
    Corporation, and Carbonite, Inc.

Security
    and Compliance

In the security and management markets, we compete against many
    companies that offer competing products to our technology
    solutions. Our primary competitors in the security and
    management market are LANDesk Software, Inc., McAfee, Microsoft,
    and Trend Micro. There are also several smaller regional
    security companies that we compete against primarily in the EMEA
    and APJ regions.

Storage
    and Server Management

The markets for storage and backup are intensely competitive.
    Our primary competitors are CA, Inc., CommVault Systems, Inc.,
    EMC Corporation (“EMC”), Hewlett-Packard Company
    (“HP”), IBM Corp. (“IBM”), Microsoft, Sun
    Microsystems, Inc., and VMware, Inc.

Services

We believe that the principal competitive factors for our
    services segment include technical capability, customer
    responsiveness, and our ability to hire and retain talented and
    experienced services personnel. Our primary competitors in the
    services segment are EMC, HP, IBM, and regional specialized
    consulting firms. In the managed security services business, our
    primary competitors are IBM, SecureWorks, Inc., and VeriSign,
    Inc.

In the SaaS business, which includes the MessageLabs offerings,
    our primary competitors are Postini, acquired by Google, Inc.,
    and Mozy.



Intellectual
    Property

Protective
    Measures

We regard some of the features of our internal operations,
    software, and documentation as proprietary and rely on
    copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws,
    confidentiality procedures, contractual arrangements, and other
    measures to protect our proprietary information. Our
    intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that
    enables us to gain recognition for our products, services, and
    technology and enhance our competitive position.

As part of our confidentiality procedures, we generally enter
    into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, distributors,
    and corporate partners, and we enter into license agreements
    with respect to our software, documentation, and other
    proprietary information. These license agreements are generally
    non-transferable and have a perpetual term. We also educate our
    employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to
    protect our facilities, equipment, and networks.

Trademarks,
    Patents, Copyrights, and Licenses

Symantec and the Symantec logo are trademarks or registered
    trademarks in the U.S. and other countries. In addition to
    Symantec and the Symantec logo, we have used, registered,

and/or

applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks
    to help distinguish our products, technologies, and services
    from those of our competitors in the U.S. and foreign
    countries and jurisdictions. We enforce our trademark, service
    mark, and trade name rights in the U.S. and abroad. The
    duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to
    country, and in the U.S. we generally are able to maintain
    our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for
    as long as the trademarks are in use.

We have a number of U.S. and foreign issued patents and
    pending patent applications, including patents and rights to
    patent applications acquired through strategic transactions,
    which relate to various aspects of our products and technology.
    The duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the
    country of issuance and for the U.S. is typically
    17 years from the date of issuance of the patent or
    20 years from the date of filing of the patent application
    resulting in the patent, which we believe is adequate relative
    to the expected lives of our products.

Our products are protected under U.S. and international
    copyright laws and laws related to the protection of
    intellectual property and proprietary information. We take
    measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary
    rights notices, and we actively enforce such rights in the
    U.S. and abroad. However, these measures may not provide
    sufficient protection, and our intellectual property rights may
    be challenged. In addition, we license some intellectual
    property from third parties for use in our products, and
    generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed
    intellectual property rights. While we believe that our ability
    to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is
    important to our success, we also believe that our business as a
    whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent,
    trademark, license, or other intellectual property right.

Seasonality

As is typical for many large software companies, our business is
    seasonal. Software license and maintenance orders are generally
    higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our
    first and second fiscal quarters. A significant decline in
    license and maintenance orders is typical in the first quarter
    of our fiscal year as compared to license and maintenance orders
    in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. In addition, we
    generally receive a higher volume of software license and
    maintenance orders in the last month of a quarter, with orders
    concentrated in the later part of that month. We believe that
    this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns
    and budget cycles, as well as the impact of compensation
    incentive plans for our sales personnel. Revenue generally
    reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than
    orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is
    shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition
    criteria are met, and because a significant portion of our
    in-period revenue is provided by the ratable recognition of our
    deferred revenue balance.



Employees

As of April 3, 2009, we employed more than
    17,400 people worldwide, approximately 48 percent of
    whom reside in the U.S. Approximately 6,300 employees
    work in sales and marketing; 5,600 in research and development;
    4,000 in support and services; and 1,500 in management,
    manufacturing, and administration.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

A description of the risk factors associated with our business
    is set forth below. The list is not exhaustive and you should
    carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before
    investing in our common stock.

The
    recent global economic crisis may harm our business, operating
    results and financial condition.

The recent global economic crisis has caused a tightening in the
    credit markets, increases in the rates of default and
    bankruptcy, and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed
    income markets. These macroeconomic developments could
    negatively affect our business, operating results or financial
    condition under a number of different scenarios. For example,
    current or potential customers may delay or forgo decisions to
    license new products or additional instances of existing
    products, upgrade their existing hardware or operating
    environments (which upgrades are often a catalyst for new
    purchases of our software), or purchase services. Customers may
    also have difficulties in obtaining the requisite third-party
    financing to complete the purchase of our products and services.
    The current economic environment could also subject us to
    increased credit risk should customers be unable to pay us, or
    delay paying us, for previously purchased products and services.
    Accordingly, reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of
    accounts receivable may increase. In addition, weakness in the
    market for end users of our products could harm the cash flow of
    our distributors and resellers who could then delay paying their
    obligations to us or experience other financial difficulties.
    This would further increase our credit risk exposure and,
    potentially, cause delays in our recognition of revenue on sales
    to these customers.

In addition, financial institution difficulties

and/or

failures may make it more difficult either to utilize our
    existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our
    operations, investing activities (including potential
    acquisitions) or financing activities. Specific economic trends,
    such as declines in the demand for PCs, servers, and other
    computing devices, or softness in corporate information
    technology spending, could have an even more direct, and
    harmful, impact on our business. Finally, our cash and our
    investment portfolio, which includes short-term debt securities,
    is subject to general credit, liquidity, counterparty, market
    and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by the recent
    global financial crisis. Our investment in our joint venture
    with Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. could also become impaired. If
    the banking system or the fixed income, credit or equity markets
    continue to deteriorate or remain volatile, our cash and our
    investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and
    liquidity of our investments could be harmed.



Fluctuations
    in demand for our products and services are driven by many
    factors, and a decrease in demand for our products could
    adversely affect our financial results.

We are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and
    services due to a variety of factors, including general economic
    conditions, competition, product obsolescence, technological
    change, shifts in buying patterns, financial difficulties and
    budget constraints of our actual and potential customers, levels
    of broadband usage, awareness of security threats to IT systems,
    and other factors. While such factors may, in some periods,
    increase product sales, fluctuations in demand can also
    negatively impact our product sales. If demand for our products
    declines because of general economic conditions or for other
    reasons, our revenues and gross margin could be adversely
    affected.

If we
    are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services
    that achieve widespread market acceptance, or if we are unable
    to continually improve the performance, features, and
    reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our
    business model to keep pace with industry trends, our business
    and operating results could be adversely affected.

Our future success depends on our ability to respond to the
    rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or
    introducing new products, product upgrades, and services on a
    timely basis. We have in the past incurred, and will continue to
    incur, significant research and development expenses as we
    strive to remain competitive. New product development and
    introduction involves a significant commitment of time and
    resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges
    including:

•

Managing the length of the development cycle for new products
    and product enhancements, which has frequently been longer than
    we originally expected

•

Adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to
    technological developments by our competitors and customers

•

Extending the operation of our products and services to new and
    evolving platforms, operating systems and hardware products,
    such as netbooks

•

Entering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited
    experience

•

Managing new product and service strategies, including
    integrating our various security and storage technologies,
    management solutions, customer service, and support into unified
    enterprise security and storage solutions

•

Incorporating acquired products and technologies

•

Trade compliance issues affecting our ability to ship new or
    acquired products

•

Developing or expanding efficient sales channels

•

Obtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access
    from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to
    enable the development and deployment of interoperable products,
    including source code licenses for certain products with deep
    technical integration into operating systems

In addition, if we cannot adapt our business models to keep pace
    with industry trends, our revenue could be negatively impacted.
    In connection with our enterprise software offerings, we license
    our applications on a variety of bases, such as per server, per
    processor, or based on performance criteria such as per amount
    of data processed or stored. If enterprises continue to migrate
    towards solutions, such as virtualization, which allow
    enterprises to run multiple applications and operating systems
    on a single server and thereby reduce the number of servers they
    are required to own and operate, we may experience lower license
    revenues unless we are able to successfully change our
    enterprise licensing model or sell additional software to take
    into account the impact of these new solutions.

If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges,
    or if our new products, product upgrades, and services are not
    technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance,
    our business and operating results could be adversely affected.



We
    operate in a highly competitive environment, and our competitors
    may gain market share in the markets for our products that could
    adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to
    decline.

We operate in intensely competitive markets that experience
    rapid technological developments, changes in industry standards,
    changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product
    introductions and improvements. If we are unable to anticipate
    or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new
    competitors gain market share in any of our markets, our
    competitive position could weaken and we could experience a drop
    in revenue that could adversely affect our business and
    operating results. To compete successfully, we must maintain a
    successful research and development effort to develop new
    products and services and enhance existing products and
    services, effectively adapt to changes in the technology or
    product rights held by our competitors, appropriately respond to
    competitive strategies, and effectively adapt to technological
    changes and changes in the ways that our information is
    accessed, used, and stored within our enterprise and consumer
    markets. If we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors
    or to changing technological and customer demands, we could
    experience a negative effect on our competitive position and our
    financial results.

Our traditional competitors include independent software vendors
    that offer software products that directly compete with our
    product offerings. In addition to competing with these vendors
    directly for sales to end-users of our products, we compete with
    them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the
    product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer
    hardware OEMs and ISPs. Our competitors could gain market share
    from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products
    with the products of our competitors or if they more actively
    promote our competitors’ products than our products. In
    addition, software vendors who have bundled our products with
    theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or
    other vendors’ software or may limit our access to standard
    product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products
    for their platform.

We face growing competition from network equipment and computer
    hardware manufacturers and large operating system providers.
    These firms are increasingly developing and incorporating into
    their products data protection and storage and server management
    software that competes at some levels with our product
    offerings. Our competitive position could be adversely affected
    to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality
    incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our
    products.

Another growing industry trend is the SaaS business model,
    whereby software vendors develop and host their applications for
    use by customers over the Internet. This allows enterprises to
    obtain the benefits of commercially licensed, internally
    operated software without the associated complexity or high
    initial

set-up

and
    operational costs. Advances in the SaaS business model could
    enable the growth of our competitors and could affect the
    success of our traditional software licensing models. We have
    released our own SaaS offerings and we recently acquired Message
    Labs, a provider of SaaS offerings, and we continue to
    incorporate these offerings into our licensing model. However,
    it is uncertain whether our SaaS strategy will prove successful
    or whether we will be able to successfully incorporate our SaaS
    offerings into our current licensing models. Our inability to
    successfully develop and market SaaS product offerings could
    cause us to lose business to competitors.

Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical,
    sales, marketing, or other resources than we do and consequently
    may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their
    products instead of ours. We also face competition from many
    smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the
    markets in which we compete.

If we
    fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively
    or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to
    their customers, our operating results could be adversely
    affected.

We sell our products to customers around the world through
    multi-tiered sales and distribution networks. Sales through
    these different channels involve distinct risks, including the
    following:

Direct Sales.

A significant portion of our
    revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our
    direct sales force to end-users. Special risks associated with
    this sales channel include:

•

Longer sales cycles associated with direct sales efforts

•

Difficulty in hiring, retaining, and motivating our direct sales
    force



•

Substantial amounts of training for sales representatives to
    become productive, including regular updates to cover new and
    revised products

Indirect Sales Channels.

A significant portion
    of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels,
    including distributors that sell our products to end-users and
    other resellers. This channel involves a number of risks,
    including:

•

Our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products
    to end-users

•

Our resellers and distributors are not subject to minimum sales
    requirements or any obligation to market our products to their
    customers

•

Our reseller and distributor agreements are generally
    nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause

•

Our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute
    competing products and may, from time to time, place greater
    emphasis on the sale of these products due to pricing,
    promotions, and other terms offered by our competitors

•

Recent consolidation of electronics retailers has increased
    their negotiating power with respect to hardware and software
    providers

OEM Sales Channels.

A significant portion of
    our revenues is derived from sales through our OEM partners that
    incorporate our products into, or bundle our products with,
    their products. Our reliance on this sales channel involves many
    risks, including:

•

Our lack of control over the shipping dates or volume of systems
    shipped

•

Our OEM partners are generally not subject to minimum sales
    requirements or any obligation to market our products to their
    customers

•

Our OEM partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements
    with us and new terms may be less favorable due, among other
    things, to an increasingly competitive relationship with certain
    partners

•

Sales through our OEM partners are subject to changes in general
    economic conditions, strategic direction, competitive risks, and
    other issues that could result in a reduction of OEM sales

•

The development work that we must generally undertake under our
    agreements with our OEM partners may require us to invest
    significant resources and incur significant costs with little or
    no associated revenues

•

The time and expense required for the sales and marketing
    organizations of our OEM partners to become familiar with our
    products may make it more difficult to introduce those products
    to the market

•

Our OEM partners may develop, market, and distribute their own
    products and market and distribute products of our competitors,
    which could reduce our sales

As noted above, the amount of our sales through our OEM channels
    is significantly affected by our partners’ sales of new
    products into which our products are bundled. The adverse
    developments in global economic conditions are, among other
    things, adversely affecting personal computer sales, and if this
    trend continues our Consumer segment could continue to be
    adversely affected.

If we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels
    successfully, these channels may conflict with one another or
    otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate, which could reduce
    our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our
    competitive position. Some of our distribution partners have
    experienced financial difficulties in the past, and if our
    partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of
    general economic conditions or for other reasons, these partners
    may delay paying their obligations to us and we may have reduced
    sales or increased bad debt expense that could adversely affect
    our operating results. In addition, reliance on multiple
    channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability
    in demand, which could increase the risk that we may be unable
    to plan effectively for the future, and could result in adverse
    operating results in future periods.



We
    have grown, and may continue to grow, through acquisitions that
    give rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect
    our future financial results.

We have in the past acquired, and we expect to acquire in the
    future, other businesses, business units, and technologies.
    Acquisitions can involve a number of special risks and
    challenges, including:

•

Complexity, time, and costs associated with the integration of
    acquired business operations, workforce, products, and
    technologies into our existing business, sales force, employee
    base, product lines, and technology

•

Diversion of management time and attention from our existing
    business and other business opportunities

•

Loss or termination of employees, including costs associated
    with the termination or replacement of those employees

•

Assumption of debt or other liabilities of the acquired
    business, including litigation related to the acquired business

•

The addition of acquisition-related debt as well as increased
    expenses and working capital requirements

•

Dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders

•

Increased costs and efforts in connection with compliance with
    Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

•

Substantial accounting charges for restructuring and related
    expenses, write-off of in-process research and development,
    impairment of goodwill, amortization of intangible assets, and
    stock-based compensation expense, such as the $7.4 billion
    goodwill write-down we recorded during fiscal 2009

Integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be
    a complex, time consuming, and expensive process, and can impact
    the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting.

If integration of our acquired businesses is not successful, we
    may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or
    suffer other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee.
    To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our
    technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and
    manage the personnel of the acquired operations. We also must
    effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired
    business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various
    interests, and may need to enter new markets in which we have no
    or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have
    stronger market positions.

Any of the foregoing, and other factors, could harm our ability
    to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired
    businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of
    acquisitions. In addition, because acquisitions of high
    technology companies are inherently risky, no assurance can be
    given that our previous or future acquisitions will be
    successful and will not adversely affect our business, operating
    results, or financial condition.

We
    have not historically maintained substantial levels of
    indebtedness, and our financial condition and results of
    operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively
    manage our liabilities.

In June 2006, we sold $2.1 billion in aggregate principal
    amount of convertible senior notes. As a result of the sale of
    the notes, we have a substantially greater amount of long-term
    debt than we have maintained in the past. In addition, we have
    entered into a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of
    $1 billion. As of April 3, 2009, we had no borrowings
    under our credit facility. From time to time in the future, we
    may also incur indebtedness in addition to the amount available
    under our credit facility. Our maintenance of substantial levels
    of debt could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage
    of certain corporate opportunities and could adversely affect
    our financial condition and results of operations. Of our
    outstanding convertible notes, $1.1 billion matures and is
    repayable in June 2011 and the balance is due in June 2013. We
    may be required to use all or a substantial portion of our cash
    balance to repay these notes on maturity unless we can obtain
    new financing.



Our
    international operations involve risks that could increase our
    expenses, adversely affect our operating results, and require
    increased time and attention of our management.

We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers
    located outside of the U.S. and we have significant
    operations outside of the U.S., including engineering, sales,
    customer support, and production. We plan to expand our
    international operations, but such expansion is contingent upon
    the financial performance of our existing international
    operations as well as our identification of growth
    opportunities. Our international operations are subject to risks
    in addition to those faced by our domestic operations, including:

•

Potential loss of proprietary information due to
    misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our
    intellectual property rights than U.S. laws or may not be
    adequately enforced

•

Requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls,
    including trade and labor restrictions and related laws that
    reduce the flexibility of our business operations

•

Regulations or restrictions on the use, import, or export of
    encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the
    acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks
    for secure communications

•

Central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate
    cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in
    international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the
    U.S.

•

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability
    such as higher interest rates in the U.S. and inflation
    that could reduce our customers’ ability to obtain
    financing for software products or that could make our products
    more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in
    certain countries

•

Limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current
    levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest
    sufficiently in our international operations

•

Longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and
    difficulties in collecting accounts receivable

•

Difficulties in staffing, managing, and operating our
    international operations, including difficulties related to
    administering our stock plans in some foreign countries

•

Difficulties in coordinating the activities of our
    geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations

•

Seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in
    Europe and in other periods in other countries

•

Reduced sales due to the failure to obtain any required export
    approval of our technologies, particularly our encryption
    technologies

•

Costs and delays associated with developing software and
    providing support in multiple languages

•

Political unrest, war, or terrorism, particularly in areas in
    which we have facilities

A significant portion of our transactions outside of the
    U.S. are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly,
    our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to
    fluctuations in foreign currency rates. We expect to be affected
    by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future,
    especially if international sales continue to grow as a
    percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the
    United States continue to increase.

The level of corporate tax from sales to our

non-U.S. customers

is less than the level of tax from sales to our
    U.S. customers. This benefit is contingent upon existing
    tax regulations in the U.S. and in the countries in which
    our international operations are located. Future changes in
    domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect
    our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits.

Our
    products are complex and operate in a wide variety of computer
    configurations, which could result in errors or product
    failures.

Because we offer very complex products, undetected errors,
    failures, or bugs may occur, especially when products are first
    introduced or when new versions are released. Our products are
    often installed and used in large-scale computing environments
    with different operating systems, system management software,
    and equipment and



networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures in
    our products or may expose undetected errors, failures, or bugs
    in our products. Our customers’ computing environments are
    often characterized by a wide variety of standard and
    non-standard configurations that make pre-release testing for
    programming or compatibility errors very difficult and
    time-consuming. In addition, despite testing by us and others,
    errors, failures, or bugs may not be found in new products or
    releases until after commencement of commercial shipments. In
    the past, we have discovered software errors, failures, and bugs
    in certain of our product offerings after their introduction
    and, in some cases, may have experienced delayed or lost
    revenues as a result of these errors.

Errors, failures, or bugs in products released by us could
    result in negative publicity, damage to our brand, product
    returns, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products,
    loss of competitive position, or claims by customers or others.
    Many of our end-user customers use our products in applications
    that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater
    sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other,
    less critical, software products. In addition, if an actual or
    perceived breach of information integrity or availability occurs
    in one of our end-user customer’s systems, regardless of
    whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market
    perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed.
    Alleviating any of these problems could require significant
    expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause
    interruptions, delays, or cessation of our product licensing,
    which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and
    could adversely affect our operating results.

If we
    are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, lose key
    personnel, fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully,
    or fail to manage our employee base effectively, we may be
    unable to develop new and enhanced products and services,
    effectively manage or expand our business, or increase our
    revenues.

Our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and
    retain our key management, technical, sales, marketing, finance,
    and other critical personnel. Our officers and other key
    personnel are

employees-at-will,

and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them.
    Competition for people with the specific skills that we require
    is significant. In order to attract and retain personnel in a
    competitive marketplace, we believe that we must provide a
    competitive compensation package, including cash and
    equity-based compensation. The volatility in our stock price may
    from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or
    retain employees. In addition, we may be unable to obtain
    required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number
    of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation
    plans, and accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of
    employee stock options and other forms of equity-based
    compensation as compensation expense. As a result, we may decide
    to issue fewer equity-based incentives and may be impaired in
    our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. If we are
    unable to hire and retain qualified employees, or conversely, if
    we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels
    when required by market conditions, our business and operating
    results could be adversely affected.

From time to time, key personnel leave our company. While we
    strive to reduce the negative impact of such changes, the loss
    of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to
    our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of
    product releases, the successful implementation and completion
    of company initiatives, the effectiveness of our disclosure
    controls and procedures and our internal control over financial
    reporting, and the results of our operations. In addition,
    hiring, training, and successfully integrating replacement sales
    and other personnel could be time consuming, may cause
    additional disruptions to our operations, and may be
    unsuccessful, which could negatively impact future revenues.

We are
    regularly a party to class action lawsuits, which often require
    significant management time and attention and result in
    significant legal expenses, and which could, if not determined
    favorably, negatively impact our business, financial condition,
    results of operations, and cash flows.

We have been named as a party to class action lawsuits, and we
    may be named in additional litigation. The expense of defending
    such litigation may be costly and divert management’s
    attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which
    could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and
    cash flows. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in such
    litigation could negatively impact our business, results of
    operations, and cash flows.



Third
    parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could
    cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from
    selling our products.

From time to time, we receive claims that we have infringed the
    intellectual property rights of others, including claims
    regarding patents, copyrights, and trademarks. In addition,
    former employers of our former, current, or future employees may
    assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to
    us the confidential or proprietary information of these former
    employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result
    in costly litigation and distract management from day-to-day
    operations. If we are not successful in defending such claims,
    we could be required to stop selling, delay shipments of, or
    redesign our products, pay monetary amounts as damages, enter
    into royalty or licensing arrangements, or satisfy
    indemnification obligations that we have with some of our
    customers. We cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing
    arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be
    available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

In addition, we license and use software from third parties in
    our business. These third party software licenses may not
    continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all,
    and may expose us to additional liability. This liability, or
    our inability to use any of this third party software, could
    result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business
    that could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

If we
    do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third
    parties from making unauthorized use of our products and
    technology, our financial results could be harmed.

Most of our software and underlying technology is proprietary.
    We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination
    of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through
    copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws. However,
    all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be
    challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. Third
    parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise
    obtain, use, distribute, and sell our proprietary information
    without authorization. Third parties may also develop similar or
    superior technology independently by designing around our
    patents. Our shrink-wrap license agreements are not signed by
    licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of
    some jurisdictions. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign
    countries do not offer the same level of protection of our
    proprietary rights as the laws of the U.S., and we may be
    subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries.
    The unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary
    information could result in reduced sales of our products. Any
    legal action to protect proprietary information that we may
    bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could
    adversely affect our ability to access software, operating
    system, and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor, or
    cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products
    to their customers. In addition, any legal action to protect
    proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in,
    alone or through our alliances with the Business Software
    Alliance (“BSA”), or the Software &
    Information Industry Association (“SIIA”), could be
    costly, may distract management from day-to-day operations, and
    may lead to additional claims against us, which could adversely
    affect our operating results.

Some
    of our products contain “open source” software, and
    any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these
    open source licenses could negatively affect our
    business.

Certain of our products are distributed with software licensed
    by its authors or other third parties under so-called “open
    source” licenses, which may include, by way of example, the
    GNU General Public License (“GPL”), GNU Lesser General
    Public License (“LGPL”), the Mozilla Public License,
    the BSD License, and the Apache License. Some of these licenses
    contain requirements that we make available source code for
    modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open
    source software, and that we license such modifications or
    derivative works under the terms of a particular open source
    license or other license granting third parties certain rights
    of further use. If we combine our proprietary software with open
    source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of
    the open source licenses, be required to release the source code
    of our proprietary software. In addition to risks related to
    license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to
    greater risks than use of third party commercial software, as
    open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or
    controls on origin of the software. We have established
    processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review
    process for screening requests from our development
    organizations for the use of open source, but we cannot be sure
    that all



open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our
    products. In addition, many of the risks associated with usage
    of open source cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly
    addressed, negatively affect our business.

Our
    software products and website may be subject to intentional
    disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future
    sales.

Although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to
    prevent intentional disruptions, we expect to be an ongoing
    target of attacks specifically designed to impede the
    performance of our products. Similarly, experienced computer
    programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the
    security of our website and misappropriate proprietary
    information or cause interruptions of our services. Because the
    techniques used by such computer programmers to access or
    sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized
    until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate
    these techniques. Our activities could be adversely affected and
    our reputation, brand and future sales harmed if these
    intentionally disruptive efforts are successful.

Increased
    customer demands on our technical support services may adversely
    affect our relationships with our customers and our financial
    results.

We offer technical support services with many of our products.
    We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate
    short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We
    also may be unable to modify the format of our support services
    to compete with changes in support services provided by
    competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers.
    Further customer demand for these services, without
    corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely
    affect our operating results.

We have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide
    consumer support functions to third party service providers. If
    these companies experience financial difficulties, do not
    maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy
    our contracts, or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient
    level under these contracts, the level of support services to
    our customers may be significantly disrupted, which could
    materially harm our relationships with these customers.

Accounting
    charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial
    results.

Our financial results have been in the past, and may continue to
    be in the future, materially affected by non-cash and other
    accounting charges, including:

•

Amortization of intangible assets, including acquired product
    rights

•

Impairment of goodwill

•

Stock-based compensation expense

•

Restructuring charges

•

Impairment of long-lived assets

•

Loss on sale of a business and similar write-downs of assets
    held for sale

For example, during fiscal 2009, we recorded a non-cash goodwill
    impairment charge of $7.4 billion, resulting in a
    significant net loss for the year. Goodwill is evaluated
    annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal
    year or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant as
    we determined they did in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, and
    our evaluation depends to a large degree on estimates and
    assumptions made by our management. Our assessment of any
    impairment of goodwill is based on a comparison of the fair
    value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of
    that reporting unit. Our determination of fair value relies on
    management’s assumptions of our future revenues, operating
    costs, and other relevant factors. If management’s
    estimates of future operating results change, or if there are
    changes to other key assumptions such as the discount rate
    applied to future operating results, the estimate of the fair
    value of our reporting units could change significantly, which
    could result in a goodwill impairment charge. In addition, we
    evaluate our other long-lived assets, including intangible
    assets whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate
    that the value of these assets might be impaired. If we
    determine that impairment has occurred, we could incur an
    impairment charge against the value of these assets.



The foregoing types of accounting charges may also be incurred
    in connection with or as a result of other business
    acquisitions. The price of our common stock could decline to the
    extent that our financial results are materially affected by the
    foregoing accounting charges.

Our
    effective tax rate may increase, which could increase our income
    tax expense and reduce our net (loss) income.

Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several
    factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:

•

Changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income
    before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate
    that have differing statutory tax rates

•

Changing tax laws, regulations, and interpretations in multiple
    jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the requirements of
    certain tax rulings

•

The tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and
    restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between
    reporting periods

•

Tax assessments, or any related tax interest or penalties, could
    significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in
    which the settlements take place.

The price of our common stock could decline if our financial
    results are materially affected by an adverse change in our
    effective tax rate.

We report our results of operations based on our determinations
    of the amount of taxes owed in the various tax jurisdictions in
    which we operate. From time to time, we receive notices that a
    tax authority in a particular jurisdiction in which we are
    subject to taxes has determined that we owe a greater amount of
    tax than we have reported to such authority. We are regularly
    engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax
    authorities. We are engaged in disputes of this nature at this
    time. If the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of
    these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax
    provision we have recorded or reserved for, our operating
    results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely
    affected.

Fluctuations
    in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of
    our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in
    the future.

Our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and
    are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number
    of factors, many of which are outside of our control and which
    could adversely affect our operations and operating results. If
    our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future
    financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities
    analysts and investors, our stock price could be negatively
    affected. Any volatility in our quarterly financial results may
    make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or
    pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock. Our
    operating results for prior periods may not be effective
    predictors of our future performance.

Factors associated with our industry, the operation of our
    business, and the markets for our products may cause our
    quarterly financial results to fluctuate, including:

•

Reduced demand for any of our products

•

Entry of new competition into our markets

•

Competitive pricing pressure for one or more of our classes of
    products

•

Our ability to timely complete the release of new or enhanced
    versions of our products

•

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

•

The number, severity, and timing of threat outbreaks (e.g. worms
    and viruses)

•

Our resellers making a substantial portion of their purchases
    near the end of each quarter



•

Enterprise customers’ tendency to negotiate site licenses
    near the end of each quarter

•

Cancellation, deferral, or limitation of orders by customers

•

Movement in interest rates

•

The rate of adoption of new product technologies and new
    releases of operating systems

•

Weakness or uncertainty in general economic or industry
    conditions in any of the multiple markets in which we operate
    that could reduce customer demand and ability to pay for our
    products and services

•

Political and military instability, which could slow spending
    within our target markets, delay sales cycles, and otherwise
    adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and operate
    effectively

•

Budgetary constraints of customers, which are influenced by
    corporate earnings and government budget cycles and spending
    objectives

•

Disruptions in our business operations or target markets caused
    by, among other things,

•

Earthquakes, floods, or other natural disasters affecting our
    headquarters located in Silicon Valley, California, an area
    known for seismic activity, or our other locations worldwide

•

Acts of war or terrorism

•

Intentional disruptions by third parties

•

Health or similar issues, such as a pandemic

Any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of
    our common stock to fluctuate significantly.

Our
    stock price may be volatile in the future, and you could lose
    the value of your investment.

The market price of our common stock has experienced significant
    fluctuations in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the
    future, and as a result you could lose the value of your
    investment. The market price of our common stock may be affected
    by a number of factors, including:

•

Announcements of quarterly operating results and revenue and
    earnings forecasts by us that fail to meet or be consistent with
    our earlier projections or the expectations of our investors or
    securities analysts

•

Announcements by either our competitors or customers that fail
    to meet or be consistent with their earlier projections or the
    expectations of our investors or securities analysts

•

Rumors, announcements, or press articles regarding our
    competitors’ operations, management, organization,
    financial condition, or financial statements

•

Changes in revenue and earnings estimates by us, our investors,
    or securities analysts

•

Accounting charges, including charges relating to the impairment
    of goodwill

•

Announcements of planned acquisitions or dispositions by us or
    by our competitors

•

Announcements of new or planned products by us, our competitors,
    or our customers

•

Gain or loss of a significant customer

•

Inquiries by the SEC, NASDAQ, law enforcement, or other
    regulatory bodies

•

Acts of terrorism, the threat of war, and other crises or
    emergency situations

•

Economic slowdowns or the perception of an oncoming economic
    slowdown in any of the major markets in which we operate

The stock market in general, and the market prices of stocks of
    technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme
    price volatility that has adversely affected, and may continue
    to adversely affect, the market price of our common stock for
    reasons unrelated to our business or operating results.

Comparison
    of cumulative total return — June 23, 1989 to
    March 31, 2009

The graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return
    on Symantec common stock from June 23, 1989 (the date of
    Symantec’s initial public offering) to March 31, 2009
    with the cumulative total return on the S&P 500 Composite
    Index and the S&P Information Technology Index over the
    same period (assuming the investment of $100 in Symantec common
    stock and in each of the other indices on June 30, 1989,
    and reinvestment of all dividends, although no dividends other
    than stock dividends have been declared on Symantec common
    stock). Symantec has provided this additional data to provide
    the perspective of a longer time period which is consistent with
    Symantec’s history as a public company. The comparisons in
    the graph below are based on historical data and are not
    intended to forecast the possible future performance of Symantec
    common stock.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

OVERVIEW

Our
    Business

Symantec is a global leader in providing security, storage and
    systems management solutions to help businesses and consumers
    secure and manage their information. We provide customers
    worldwide with software and services that protect, manage and
    control information risks related to security, data protection,
    storage, compliance, and systems management. We help our
    customers manage cost, complexity and compliance by protecting
    their IT infrastructure as they seek to maximize value from
    their IT investments.

We have a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to
    March 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to fiscal
    years in this report relate to fiscal year and periods ended
    April 3, 2009, March 28, 2008 and March 30, 2007.
    Fiscal 2008 and 2007 each consisted of 52 weeks while
    fiscal 2009 consisted of 53 weeks. Our 2010 fiscal year
    will consist of 52 weeks and will end on April 2, 2010.

Our
    Operating Segments

Our operating segments are significant strategic business units
    that offer different products and services, distinguished by
    customer needs. Since the March 2008 quarter, we have operated
    in five operating segments: Consumer, Security and Compliance,
    Storage and Server Management, Services, and Other. During the
    June 2008 quarter, we changed our reporting segments to better
    align our operating structure, resulting in the Altiris services
    that were formerly included in the Security and Compliance
    segment being moved to the Services segment. We revised the
    segment information for the prior year to conform to the new
    presentation.

For further descriptions of our operating segments, see
    Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    in this annual report. Our reportable segments are the same as
    our operating segments.

Financial
    Results and Trends

Revenue for fiscal 2009 was $6.1 billion, or 5% higher than
    revenue for fiscal 2008. For fiscal 2009, we realized revenue
    growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific Japan as compared to
    fiscal 2008 and experienced revenue growth in all of our
    segments. Revenue growth in our EMEA geography was relatively
    flat from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009. Foreign currency
    fluctuations had relatively little overall impact on our
    international revenue growth for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal
    2008. In fiscal 2008, foreign currency fluctuations positively
    impacted our revenue growth internationally compared to fiscal
    2007. We are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in
    future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates. If international sales become a greater portion
    of our total sales in the future, changes in foreign exchange
    rates may have a greater impact on our revenues and operating
    results.

In fiscal 2009 the global economic slowdown increased
    competitive pricing pressures and led to longer lead times in
    the sales of some of our products and may have otherwise
    adversely affected purchase decisions in our



markets. If the challenging economic conditions affecting global
    markets continue or deteriorate further, we may experience
    slower or negative revenue growth and our business and operating
    results might suffer. For example, our revenue declined slightly
    in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 relative to the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2008, although this was due in part to year
    over year changes in foreign exchange rates. In light of these
    economic conditions, we will continue to align our cost
    structure with our revenue expectations.

Employee-related costs have been the primary driver of our
    operating expenses, and we expect this trend to continue.
    Employee-related costs include items such as wages, commissions,
    bonuses, vacation, benefits, and stock-based compensation. We
    had 17,426, 17,648, and 17,131 employees as of the end of
    fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease during
    fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to the impact of our cost
    and expense discipline, partially offset by employees added
    through acquisitions.

During fiscal 2009, based on a combination of factors, including
    the current economic environment and a sustained decline in our
    market capitalization, we concluded that there were sufficient
    indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill
    impairment analysis. As a result of this interim analysis, we
    recorded a $7.4 billion non-cash goodwill impairment during
    fiscal 2009. Primarily as a result of this charge, our net loss
    was $6.7 billion for fiscal 2009 as compared to our net
    income of $464 million and $404 million for fiscal
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

On November 14, 2008, we acquired MessageLabs Group Limited
    (“MessageLabs”), a nonpublic United Kingdom-based
    provider of managed services to protect, control, encrypt, and
    archive electronic communications for $630 million, net of
    cash acquired. We believe this acquisition complements our SaaS
    business.

On October 6, 2008, we acquired PC Tools Pty Ltd. (“PC
    Tools”), a nonpublic Australia-based provider of security
    and systems software, for approximately $262 million in
    cash, net of cash acquired. We believe this acquisition
    complements our consumer security software business.

We completed four other acquisitions during fiscal 2009 for a
    combined cash consideration of $215 million. See
    Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
    this annual report for further details.

In the face of a challenging economic environment, cash flows
    remained strong in fiscal 2009 as we achieved $1.7 billion
    in operating cash flow. We ended fiscal 2009 with nearly
    $2.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
    investments. In addition, during fiscal 2009 we repurchased
    42 million shares of our common stock at an average price
    of $16.53, for total consideration of $700 million.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and
    related notes included in this annual report in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States,
    requires us to make estimates, which include judgments and
    assumptions, that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and related disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates
    on historical experience and on various assumptions that we
    believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate
    our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly.
    Historically, our critical accounting estimates have not
    differed materially from actual results; however, actual results
    may differ from these estimates under different conditions. If
    actual results differ from these estimates and other
    considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual
    report, the resulting changes could have a material adverse
    effect on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and in
    certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on
    liquidity and our financial condition.

A critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and
    assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the
    estimate is made. Different estimates that reasonably could have
    been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially
    impact the operating results or financial condition. We believe
    that the estimates described below represent our critical
    accounting estimates, as they have the greatest potential impact
    on our consolidated financial statements. See also Note 1
    of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
    in this annual report.



Revenue
    Recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software
    industry. We recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the
    requirements of Statement of Position

97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition

, and any applicable
    amendments or modifications. Revenue recognition requirements in
    the software industry are very complex and require us to make
    many estimates.

In arrangements that include multiple elements, including
    perpetual software licenses and maintenance

and/or

services, and packaged products with content updates, we
    allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on
    vendor specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of the
    fair value of the undelivered elements, and recognize the
    difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount
    deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. Our deferred
    revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of
    enterprise product maintenance, consumer product content
    updates, and arrangements where VSOE does not exist. Deferred
    revenue totaled approximately $3.1 billion as of
    April 3, 2009, of which $419 million was classified as
    “Long-term deferred revenue” in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. VSOE of each element is based on the price for
    which the undelivered element is sold separately. We determine
    fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical
    evidence of our stand-alone sales of these elements to third
    parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered
    elements. When VSOE does not exist for undelivered items, such
    as maintenance, then the entire arrangement fee is recognized
    ratably over the performance period. Changes to the elements in
    a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those
    elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and the
    degree of flexibility in contractual arrangements could
    materially impact the amount recognized in the current period
    and deferred over time.

For our consumer products that include content updates, we
    recognize revenue and the associated cost of revenue ratably
    over the term of the subscription upon sell-through to
    end-users, as the subscription period commences upon sale to an
    end-user. We defer revenue and cost of revenue amounts for
    unsold product held by our distributors and resellers.

We expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate
    inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer
    demand, which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand
    based on recent buying trends. We ship product to our
    distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid
    purchase orders. Our distributors and resellers base the
    quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer
    demand, which may exceed the expected level of a four or six
    week supply. We offer limited rights of return if the inventory
    held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected
    level of a four or six week supply. We estimate future returns
    under these limited rights of return in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”)
    No. 48,

Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists.

We typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory
    held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected
    level. Because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of
    excess inventory that will be returned, we primarily offset
    deferred revenue against trade accounts receivable for the
    amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels.

Reserves for product returns.

We reserve for
    estimated product returns as an offset to revenue based
    primarily on historical trends. We fully reserve for obsolete
    products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred
    revenue for products with content updates and to revenue for all
    other products. If we made different estimates, material
    differences could result in the amount and timing of our net
    revenues for any period presented. More or less product may be
    returned than what was estimated

and/or

the
    amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what
    was estimated. These factors and unanticipated changes in the
    economic and industry environment could make actual results
    differ from our return estimates.

Reserves for rebates.

We estimate and record
    reserves for channel and end-user rebates as an offset to
    revenue. For consumer products that include content updates,
    rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the
    term of the subscription. Our estimated reserves for channel
    volume incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and
    resellers’ actual performance against the terms and
    conditions of volume incentive rebate programs, which are
    typically entered into quarterly. Our reserves for end-user
    rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the
    promotional programs, actual sales during the promotion, amount
    of actual redemptions received, historical redemption trends by
    product and by type of promotional program, and the value of the
    rebate. We also consider current market conditions and economic
    trends when estimating our reserves for rebates. If actual
    redemptions



differ from our estimates, material differences may result in
    the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period
    presented.

Valuation
    of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived
    assets

When we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to
    tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible
    assets acquired. Any residual purchase price is recorded as
    goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires
    management to make significant estimates in determining the fair
    values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially
    with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based on
    historical experience and information obtained from the
    management of the acquired companies. These estimates can
    include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is
    expected to generate in the future, the appropriate
    weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected
    to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are
    inherently uncertain and unpredictable. In addition,
    unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may
    affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates.

Goodwill.

As of April 3, 2009, goodwill
    was $4.6 billion. We review goodwill for impairment on an
    annual basis and on an interim basis whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS No. 142”). The provisions of
    SFAS No. 142 require that a two-step impairment test
    be performed on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the
    estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its allocated
    carrying value (book value). If the carrying value of the
    reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the equity assigned to
    that unit, there is an indicator of impairment and we must
    perform the second step of the impairment test, which requires
    determining the implied fair value of that reporting unit’s
    goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for
    an acquired business. If the carrying value of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we
    would record an impairment loss equal to the excess.

Our reporting units are identified in accordance with
    SFAS No. 142 and are either equivalent to, or
    represent one level below, an operating segment. Each reporting
    unit constitutes a business for which discrete financial
    information is available and for which segment management
    regularly reviews the operating results. Our operating segments
    are significant strategic business units that offer different
    products and services, distinguished by customer needs. Our
    reporting units are consistent with our operating segments,
    except for the Services segment, which includes the SaaS and the
    Services reporting units. The SaaS reporting unit is new for
    fiscal 2009 and was primarily the result of an acquisition
    during the year.

Prior to performing our second step in the goodwill impairment
    analysis, we perform an assessment of long-lived assets for
    impairment. Such long-lived assets include tangible and
    intangible assets recorded in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

and SFAS No. 86,

Accounting for the Costs of Software to Be Sold, Leased of
    Otherwise Marketed

.

The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill
    requires significant judgment at many points during the
    analysis. In determining the carrying value of the reporting
    units, we had to apply judgment to allocate the assets and
    liabilities, such as accounts receivable and property and
    equipment, based on specific identification or relevant driver,
    as they are not held by those reporting units but by functional
    departments. Goodwill was allocated to the reporting units based
    on a combination of specific identification and relative fair
    values, which is consistent with the methodology utilized in the
    prior year impairment analysis. The use of relative fair values
    was necessary for certain reporting units due to changes in our
    operating structure in prior years. Furthermore, to determine
    the reporting units’ fair value, we use the income approach
    under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit
    based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that
    unit. The income approach was determined to be the most
    representative valuation technique that would be utilized by a
    market participant in an assumed transaction, but the results
    are corroborated with the market approach which measures the
    value of an asset through an analysis of recent sales or
    offerings of comparable property. When applied to the valuation
    of equity interests, consideration is given to the financial
    condition and operating performance of the company being
    appraised relative to those of publicly traded companies
    operating in the same or similar lines of business, potentially
    subject to corresponding economic, environmental, and political
    factors and considered to be reasonable investment alternatives.
    We also consider our market capitalization on the date we
    perform our analysis. Significant assumptions are based on



historical and forecasted amounts specific to each reporting
    unit, and consider estimates of cash flows, including revenues,
    operating costs, growth rates and other relevant factors, as
    well as discount rates to be applied. Although our cash flow
    forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the
    plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying
    reporting units, there is significant judgment in determining
    the cash flows attributable to these reporting units over their
    remaining useful lives.

Based on a combination of factors, including the current
    economic environment and a decline in our market capitalization,
    we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us
    to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis during the
    third quarter of fiscal 2009. The analysis was not completed
    during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and an estimated
    impairment charge of $7.0 billion was recorded. The
    analysis was subsequently finalized and an additional impairment
    charge of $413 million was included in our results for the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. As a result, we incurred a total
    impairment charge of $7.4 billion for fiscal 2009. We also
    performed our annual impairment analysis during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2009 and determined that no additional
    impairment charge was necessary.

The methodology applied in the current year analyses was
    consistent with the methodology applied in the prior year
    analysis, but was based on updated assumptions, as appropriate.
    As a result of the downturn in the economic environment during
    the second half of calendar 2008, determining the fair value of
    the individual reporting units was even more judgmental than in
    the past. In particular, the global economic recession has
    reduced our visibility into long-term trends and consequently,
    estimates of future cash flows used in the current year analyses
    are lower than those used in the prior year analysis. The
    discount rates utilized in the analysis also reflect
    market-based estimates of the risks associated with the
    projected cash flows of individual reporting units and were
    increased from the prior year analysis to reflect increased risk
    due to current volatility in the economic environment.

If there are changes to the methods used to allocate carrying
    values, if management’s estimates of future operating
    results change, if there are changes in the identified reporting
    units or if there are changes to other significant assumptions,
    the estimated carrying values for each reporting unit and the
    estimated fair value of our goodwill could change significantly,
    and could result in an impairment charge. Such changes could
    also result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods,
    which could have a significant impact on our operating results
    and financial condition therein.

Intangible Assets.

We assess the impairment of
    identifiable intangible assets according to SFAS Nos. 142
    or 144, as appropriate, whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying amount may
    not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when
    the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected
    to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition
    is less than its carrying amount. Such impairment loss would be
    measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the
    asset and its fair value. Our cash flow assumptions are based on
    historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs, and other
    relevant factors. If management’s estimates of future
    operating results change, or if there are changes to other
    assumptions, the estimate of the fair value of our acquired
    product rights and other identifiable intangible assets could
    change significantly. Such change could result in impairment
    charges in future periods, which could have a significant impact
    on our operating results and financial condition.

We account for developed technology or acquired product rights
    in accordance with SFAS No. 86

.

We record
    impairment charges on acquired product rights when we determine
    that the net realizable value of the assets may not be
    recoverable. To determine the net realizable value of the
    assets, we use the estimated future gross revenues from each
    product. Our estimated future gross revenues of each product are
    based on company forecasts and are subject to change.

Long-Lived Assets (including Assets Held for
    Sale).

We account for long-lived assets in
    accordance with SFAS No. 144.  We record
    impairment charges on long-lived assets to be held and used when
    we determine that the carrying value of the long-lived assets
    may not be recoverable. Based upon the existence of one or more
    indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment of
    long-lived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow
    method using assumptions determined by our management to be
    commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business
    model. Our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment
    based on our historical results and anticipated results and are
    subject to many triggering factors which could change and cause
    a material impact to our operating results or financial
    condition. We record impairment charges on long-lived assets to
    be held for sale when



we determine that the carrying value of the long-lived assets
    may not be recoverable. In determining our fair value, we obtain
    market value appraisal information from third-parties.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

Beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2009, the assessment of
    fair value for our financial instruments is based on the
    provisions of SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements

. SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair
    value hierarchy that is based on three levels of inputs and
    requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and
    minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
    value.

We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields,
    broker/dealer quotes and other similar data which are obtained
    from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices or other
    sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and
    liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input, to
    which we have not made any material adjustments, to make our
    assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of
    our investment portfolio, and we are ultimately responsible for
    the financial statements and underlying estimates. The fair
    value and inputs are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further
    validated by comparison to publicly available information and
    could be adjusted based on market indices or other information
    that management deems material to their estimate of fair value.

As of April 3, 2009, our financial instruments measured at
    fair value on a recurring basis included $1.5 billion of
    assets. Our cash equivalents primarily consist of money market
    funds, bank securities, and government notes and represent 98%
    of our total financial instruments measured at fair value on a
    recurring basis.

As of April 3, 2009, $392 million of investments were
    classified as Level 1, most of which represents investments
    in money market funds. These were classified as Level 1
    because their valuations were based on quoted prices for
    identical securities in active markets. Determining fair value
    for Level 1 instruments generally does not require
    significant management judgment.

As of April 3, 2009, $1.1 billion of investments were
    classified as Level 2, of which $474 million and
    $654 million (98% together of total financial instruments
    fair valued on a recurring basis) represent investments in
    corporate securities and government securities, respectively.
    These were classified as Level 2 because either
    (1) the estimated fair value is based on the fair value of
    similar securities or (2) their valuations were based on
    pricing models with all significant inputs derived from or
    corroborated by observable market prices for identical
    securities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent
    transactions (less active markets). Level 2 inputs
    generally are based on non-binding market consensus prices that
    are corroborated by observable market data; quoted prices for
    similar instruments;

and/or

model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are
    observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated
    with observable market data for substantially the full term of
    the assets or liabilities or quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities. While determining the fair value for Level 2
    instruments does not necessarily require significant management
    judgment, it generally involves the following level of judgment
    and subjectivity:

•

Determining whether a market is considered active. An assessment
    of an active market for marketable securities generally takes
    into consideration trading volume for each instrument type or
    whether a trading market exists for a given instrument. Our
    Level 2 financial instruments were so classified due to
    either low trading activity in active markets or no active
    market existing. For those securities where no active market
    existed, amortized cost was used and approximates fair value
    because of their short maturities. For these financial
    instruments classified as Level 2 as of April 3, 2009,
    we used identical securities for determining fair value.

•

Determining which model-derived valuations to use in determining
    fair value. When observable market prices for identical
    securities or similar securities are not available, we may price
    marketable securities using: non-binding market consensus prices
    that are corroborated with observable market data; or pricing
    models, such as discounted cash flow approaches, with all
    significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable
    market data. In addition, the credit ratings for issuers of debt
    instruments in which we are invested could change, which could
    lead to lower fair values. As of April 3, 2009, the fair
    value of



$12 million of fixed-income securities was determined using
    benchmark pricing models for identical or similar securities.

As of April 3, 2009, we have no financial instruments with
    unobservable inputs as classified in Level 3 under the
    SFAS No. 157 hierarchy. Level 3 instruments
    generally would include unobservable inputs to be used in the
    valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of
    fair value of assets or liabilities. The determination of fair
    value for Level 3 instruments requires the most management
    judgment and subjectivity.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

. Under the
    fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock-based
    compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair
    value of the award and is recognized as expense over the
    requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period
    of the respective award.

Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant
    date requires judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing
    model to determine the fair value of stock options. The
    determination of the fair value of stock-based awards on the
    date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our
    stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex
    and subjective variables. These variables include our expected
    stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and
    projected employee stock option exercise and cancellation
    behaviors, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends.

We estimate the expected life of options granted based on an
    analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and
    post-vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the
    contractual life of the option. Expected volatility is based on
    the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate
    with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility
    of traded options. The risk free interest rate is equal to the
    U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal
    to the expected life. We do not currently pay cash dividends on
    our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the
    foreseeable future. Accordingly, our expected dividend yield is
    zero.

In accordance with SFAS No. 123R, we only record
    stock-based compensation expense for awards that are expected to
    vest. As a result, judgment is also required in estimating the
    amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited.
    Although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience,
    actual forfeitures may differ. If actual results differ
    significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation
    expense and our results of operations could be materially
    impacted when we record a

true-up

for
    the difference in the period that the awards vest.

Contingencies
    and Litigation

We evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or
    pending litigation in accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies.

We assess the likelihood of
    any adverse judgments or outcomes from a potential claim or
    legal proceeding, as well as potential ranges of probable
    losses, when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are
    probable and reasonably estimable. A determination of the amount
    of accrued liabilities required, if any, for these contingencies
    is made after the analysis of each separate matter. Because of
    uncertainties related to these matters, we base our estimates on
    the information available at the time of our assessment. As
    additional information becomes available, we reassess the
    potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation
    and may revise our estimates. Any revisions in the estimates of
    potential liabilities could have a material impact on our
    operating results and financial position.

Income
    Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. The
    provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and
    liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for
    operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in each jurisdiction
    in which we operate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to
    taxable



income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are
    expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation
    allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is
    believed more likely than not to be realized.

We are required to compute our income taxes in each federal,
    state, and international jurisdiction in which we operate. This
    process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as
    well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and
    tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as
    accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax
    purposes. The income tax effects of the differences we identify
    are classified as current or long-term deferred tax assets and
    liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our judgments,
    assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for
    income tax take into account current tax laws, our
    interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of
    current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax
    authorities. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax
    laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could
    significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of
    Operations. We must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax
    assets will be realized from future taxable income and, based on
    this assessment, establish a valuation allowance, if required.
    Our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a
    number of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including
    forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and the relative
    proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various
    domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. To
    the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the
    valuation allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a
    corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations, or to goodwill to the
    extent that the valuation allowance related to tax attributes of
    the acquired entities.

In July 2008, we reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue
    Service (“IRS”) concerning our eligibility to claim a
    lower tax rate on a distribution made from a Veritas foreign
    subsidiary prior to the July 2005 acquisition. The distribution
    was intended to be made pursuant to the American Jobs Creation
    Act of 2004, and therefore eligible for a 5.25% effective
    U.S. federal rate of tax, in lieu of the 35% statutory
    rate. The final impact of this agreement is not yet known since
    this relates to the taxability of earnings that are otherwise
    the subject of the tax years

2000-2001

transfer pricing dispute which in turn is being addressed in the
    U.S. Tax Court. To the extent that we owe taxes as a result
    of the transfer pricing dispute, we anticipate that the
    incremental tax due from this negotiated agreement will
    decrease. We currently estimate that the most probable outcome
    from this negotiated agreement will be $13 million or less,
    for which an accrual has already been made. We made a payment of
    $130 million to the IRS for this matter in May 2006. We
    applied $110 million of this payment as a deposit on the
    outstanding transfer pricing matter for the tax years

2000-2001.

Net revenues increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal
    2008 primarily due to a $301 million increase in Content,
    subscriptions, and maintenance revenues. This increase was
    primarily related to increased revenues in our Storage and
    Server Management and Services segments. In addition, revenues
    for fiscal 2009 benefited from additional amortization of
    deferred revenue of approximately $75 million as a result
    of fiscal 2009 comprising 53 weeks as compared to
    52 weeks in fiscal 2008. The global economic slowdown has
    increased competitive pricing pressure and the lead time to
    close on sales for some of our products. While we cannot predict
    the intensity or duration of this slowdown, we believe the
    recurring nature of our business and the mission-critical nature
    of our products position us well in this challenging environment.

Net revenues increased for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal
    2007 primarily due to a $644 million increase in Content,
    subscriptions, and maintenance revenues coupled with a
    $31 million increase in Licenses revenues. These increases
    were primarily related to increased revenues in our Storage and
    Server Management, Security and Compliance, and Consumer
    segments as a result of higher beginning deferred revenue
    balances and increased sales.



Included in the increase noted above is $194 million due to
    the sales of new products and services from our Altiris
    acquisition for which there is no comparable revenue in the
    prior period. The increase is also due to a favorable foreign
    currency impact. We also benefited in fiscal 2008 from a higher
    deferred revenue balance compared to fiscal 2007.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues increased for
    fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to an
    aggregate increase in revenue from the Storage and Server
    Management and Services segments of $246 million. The
    increase in these two segments’ revenue is largely
    attributable to demand for our Storage and Server Management
    products and consulting services as a result of increased demand
    for security and storage solutions. This increased demand was
    driven by the proliferation of structured and unstructured data,
    and increasing sales of services in conjunction with our license
    sales as a result of our focus on offering our customers a more
    comprehensive IT solution. Furthermore, growth in our customer
    base through acquisitions and new license sales results in an
    increase to Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues
    because a large number of our customers renew their annual
    maintenance contracts.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenues increased in
    fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an
    increase of $394 million in revenue related to enterprise
    products and services, excluding acquired Altiris products. This
    increase in enterprise product and services revenue was largely
    attributable to higher amortization of deferred revenue, as a
    result of our larger deferred revenue balances during fiscal
    2008 compared to fiscal 2007. In addition, Content,
    subscriptions, and maintenance revenues increased from sales of
    new products from our Altiris acquisition for which there is no
    comparable revenue in the prior period. The increase is also due
    to a favorable foreign currency impact for fiscal 2008 compared
    to fiscal 2007.

Licenses revenues decreased slightly for fiscal 2009 as compared
    to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a decrease in revenue related to
    our Security and Compliance products offset by an increase in
    revenue related to our Storage and Server Management products.
    The decreases in Security and Compliance license revenues are
    primarily a result of the challenging economic environment and a
    decline in demand from small and medium businesses. Offsetting
    increases in Storage and Server Management license revenues are
    a result of increased demand for storage solutions driven by the
    proliferation of structured and unstructured data.

Licenses revenue increased in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal
    2007 primarily due to an increase from the sales of new products
    from our Altiris acquisition for which there is no comparable
    revenue in the prior period and a favorable foreign currency
    impact.

    security products in our electronic channels, offset by a
    decrease in our retail channels. Our electronic channels include
    sales derived from OEMs, subscriptions, upgrades, online sales,
    and renewals. In addition, Consumer revenues increased from the
    sale of our consumer services and acquired security products.

Consumer revenues increased for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal

Storage and Server Management revenues increased for fiscal 2009
    as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to increased sales of
    products related to storage management, data protection,
    disaster recovery and products supporting high availability. The
    demand for these products is driven by the increase in the
    proliferation of structured and unstructured data as well as the
    increasing demand for optimization of storage systems.

Storage and Server Management revenues increased for fiscal 2008
    as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to increased demand for
    products related to the standardization and simplification of
    data center infrastructure and higher amortization of deferred
    revenue, for the reasons discussed above in “Total Net
    Revenues.” Included in the total Storage and Server
    Management segment revenue increase for fiscal 2008 is a
    favorable foreign currencies impact.

Operating income for the Storage and Server Management segment
    increased for the fiscal 2009 as compared to the fiscal 2008, as
    revenue growth was coupled with a decrease in expenses. Total
    expenses for the fiscal 2009 decreased partly as a result of the
    fiscal 2008 divestiture of the APM business.

Operating income for this segment increased for fiscal 2008 as
    compared to fiscal 2007, as the increase in revenues more than
    offset the increase in expenses. Total expenses from our Storage
    and Server Management segment increased primarily as a result of
    the impairment of intangible assets related to the APM business
    of $95 million. Additionally, increases in sales expenses
    drove costs higher for the Storage and Server Management group.

    result of our November 14, 2008 acquisition of MessageLabs.
    The remaining increase in revenues was in our consulting
    services and Business Critical Services, as a result of
    increased demand for more comprehensive software implementation
    assistance and increased demand for our Business Critical
    Services. Customers are increasingly purchasing our service
    offerings in conjunction with the purchase of our products and
    augmenting the capabilities of their own IT staff with our
    onsite consultants.

Services revenues increased for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal
    2007 primarily due to an increase in consulting services as a
    result of increased demand for a more comprehensive solution by
    purchasing our service offerings in conjunction with the
    purchase of our products and the increased desire for customers
    to augment the capabilities of their own IT staff with our
    onsite consultants. Services revenues increased as a result of
    sales of new services from



our Altiris acquisition for which there is no comparable revenue
    in the prior period. In addition, Services revenue increased due
    to increased demand for our Business Critical Services.

The operating loss for the Services segment decreased for the
    fiscal 2009, as revenue growth exceeded expense growth for the
    segment. Our focus on margin improvement contributed to the
    decrease in operating loss.

Operating loss for this segment decreased for fiscal 2008 as
    compared to fiscal 2007, as the increase in revenues more than
    offset the increase in expenses. Total expenses from our
    Services segment increased $80 million in fiscal 2008 as
    compared to fiscal 2007. The increase is primarily a result of
    higher salary and wages to support the increase in revenue and
    includes the impact of the fiscal 2008 Altiris acquisition.

Revenue from our Other segment is comprised primarily of sunset
    products and products nearing the end of their life cycle. Our
    Other segment also includes general and administrative expenses;
    amortization of acquired product rights, intangible assets, and
    other assets; goodwill impairment charges; charges such as
    stock-based compensation and restructuring; and certain indirect
    costs that are not charged to the other operating segments. The
    operating loss of our Other segment for fiscal 2009 primarily
    consists of the $7.4 billion charge related to impairment
    of goodwill that was recorded during fiscal 2009.

Revenues from the Other segment for fiscal 2008 compared to
    fiscal 2007 were immaterial.

Americas revenues increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to
    fiscal 2008 primarily due to increased revenues related to our
    Storage and Server Management and Services segments. In
    addition, for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, Americas
    revenues related to our Consumer segment increased driven by
    demand for our Consumer segment products suites.



EMEA revenues decreased slightly for fiscal 2009 as compared to
    fiscal 2008 primarily due to decreased revenues related to our
    Consumer and Security and Compliance segments as a result of a
    strengthening U.S. dollar and a decrease in endpoint
    security product sales to small and medium sized businesses.
    This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues
    related to our Storage and Server Management and Services
    segments.

Asia Pacific Japan revenues increased for fiscal 2009 as
    compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to increased revenues
    related to our Storage and Server Management segment.

International revenues increased in fiscal 2008 as compared to
    fiscal 2007 primarily due to increased revenues related to our
    Storage and Server Management and Security and Compliance
    segments, as a result of increased demand for products related
    to the standardization and simplification of data center
    infrastructure and higher amortization of deferred revenue for
    the reasons described above. These products also contributed to
    the increased revenues in the Americas in fiscal 2008 as
    compared to fiscal 2007. Sales of new products from our
    acquisition of Altiris increased revenues in the international
    regions and the Americas for which there is no comparable
    revenue in the prior period. Growth in revenues in international
    regions and the Americas from sales of our Consumer products was
    driven by prior period demand for Norton Internet Security
    products. Foreign currencies had a favorable impact on net
    revenues in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007.

Our international sales are and will continue to be a
    significant portion of our net revenues. As a result, net
    revenues will continue to be affected by foreign currency
    exchange rates as compared to the U.S. dollar. While the
    current global economic slowdown has recently resulted in a
    strengthening U.S. dollar, we are unable to predict the
    extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If international
    sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future,
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a greater
    impact on our revenues and operating results.

Cost of revenues consists primarily of the amortization of

    costs of billable services, payments to OEMs under
    revenue-sharing arrangements, manufacturing and direct material
    costs, and royalties paid to third parties under technology
    licensing agreements.

Gross margin increased slightly in fiscal 2009 as compared to
    fiscal 2008 primarily due to higher revenues and, to a lesser
    extent, lower OEM royalty payments and distribution costs,
    partially offset by a year over year increase in technical
    support costs.

Gross margin increased in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007
    due primarily to an increase in revenue and the fact that the
    terms of several of our OEM arrangements changed from
    revenue-sharing arrangements to placement fee arrangements in
    late fiscal 2007. Placement fee arrangements are expensed on an
    estimated average cost basis, while revenue-sharing arrangements
    are generally amortized ratably over a one-year period. In
    addition, we realized year over year increases in services and
    technical support costs.

Cost of licenses remained stable as a percentage of the related
    revenue for the fiscal 2009 as compared to the fiscal 2008.
    Decreases in manufacturing and site license costs were partially
    offset by higher royalties.

Cost of licenses decreased as a percentage of the related
    revenue in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The year over
    year decrease in Cost of licenses as a percentage of the related
    revenue is primarily attributable to higher revenues and to a
    lesser extent due to lower obsolescence reserves. Fiscal 2007
    had relatively high obsolescence reserves due to our decision to
    exit certain aspects of the appliance business.

Acquired product rights are comprised of developed technologies
    and patents from acquired companies.

The increase in amortization for the fiscal 2009 as compared to
    the fiscal 2008 is primarily due to amortization associated with
    SwapDrive, PC Tools and MessageLabs acquisitions during the
    fiscal 2009 periods offset in part by the APM business
    divestiture in the fiscal 2008 period.

The amortization in fiscal 2008 was higher than fiscal 2007
    primarily due to amortization associated with the Altiris
    acquisition, offset in part by certain acquired product rights
    becoming fully amortized. For further discussion of acquired
    product rights and related amortization, see Notes 5 and 6
    of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual
    report.

Operating
    Expenses

Operating
    expenses overview

As discussed above under “Our Business,” our operating
    expenses for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 were
    adversely impacted by an additional week during fiscal 2009. Our
    international expenses during the fiscal



2009 were favorably impacted by the strengthening of the
    U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies during fiscal
    2008 and by the 2009 restructuring plan. In addition, our
    ongoing cost and expense discipline positively contributed to
    our increased operating margins for the fiscal 2009 periods.

Our operating expenses for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal
    2007 were adversely impacted by higher international expenses
    resulting from the U.S. dollar weakening in comparison to
    foreign currencies coupled with additional headcount resulting
    from acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by our
    2008 restructuring plan initiatives and our ongoing cost and
    expense discipline.

As a percent of net revenues, sales and marketing expenses
    decreased to 39% for the fiscal 2009 as compared to 41% for the
    fiscal 2008 as a result of the factors discussed above under
    “Operating expenses overview.”

Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues
    increased to 41% in fiscal 2008 as compared to 39% in fiscal
    2007. The percentage increase and increase in absolute dollars
    in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2008 as compared to
    fiscal 2007 is primarily due to higher employee compensation
    expense as a result of the Altiris and Vontu acquisitions and
    the OEM placement fees as discussed above under “Financial
    Results and Trends.” We negotiated new contract terms with
    some of our OEM partners in fiscal 2007, for which the expense
    commenced being recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
    In addition, these new contract terms had the effect of moving
    our OEM payments from Cost of revenues to Operating expenses.

    “Operating expenses overview.” The increase in



general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2008 as compared
    with fiscal 2007 is primarily due to higher salaries and wages
    resulting from the Altiris and Vontu acquisitions offset by a

In connection with the restructuring plans described in
    Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
    this annual report, restructuring charges increased to
    $96 million for fiscal 2009 from $74 million in fiscal
    2008. The 2009 restructuring amount primarily consisted of
    severance charges of $64 million largely related to the
    2009 Plan (as defined in Note 9) reduction in force
    and the 2008 Plan business structure changes, $21 million
    related to the outsourcing of back office functions to various
    third-party outsourcers and $11 million related to
    facilities costs associated with earlier acquisitions. The 2008
    amount primarily consisted of severance charges of
    $59 million largely related to the reduction in force
    actions in both the 2008 Plan and 2007 Plan (each as defined in
    Note 9) and $15 million related to facilities
    costs associated with earlier acquisitions. Restructuring
    charges increased slightly in fiscal 2008 from $71 million
    in fiscal 2007. The 2007 amount primarily consisted of severance
    charges related to the 2007 Plan reduction in force.

Total remaining costs for the 2008 Plan are estimated to range
    from $25 million to $55 million. Total remaining costs
    for the transition activities associated with outsourcing back
    office functions are estimated to be approximately
    $40 million. Total remaining costs related to the 2009 Plan
    and 2007 Plan are not expected to be material.

Based on a combination of factors, including the current
    economic environment and a decline in our market capitalization,
    we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us
    to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis during the
    third quarter of fiscal 2009. The analysis was not completed
    during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and an estimated
    impairment charge of $7.0 billion was recorded. The
    analysis was subsequently finalized and an additional impairment
    charge of $413 million was included in our results for the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. As a result, we incurred a total
    impairment charge of $7.4 billion for fiscal 2009. We also
    performed our annual impairment analysis during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2009 and determined that no additional
    impairment charge was necessary.

For the purposes of this analysis, our estimates of fair value
    are based on a combination of the income approach, and the
    market approach. The income approach estimates the fair value of
    our reporting units based on the future discounted cash flows.
    We also consider the market approach, which estimates the fair
    value of our reporting units based on comparable market prices.

During the year ended April 3, 2009, we recognized an
    impairment of $47 million on certain land and buildings
    classified as held for sale. SFAS No. 144 provides
    that a long-lived asset classified as held for sale should be
    measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less
    cost to sell.

During the year ended March 28, 2007, we determined that
    the APM business in the Storage and Server Management segment
    did not meet the long-term strategic objectives of the segment.
    As such, we recognized an impairment of $96 million,
    primarily due to sale of the APM business during fiscal 2008.

Interest income decreased during fiscal years 2009 and 2008
    primarily due to lower average cash balances outstanding and
    lower average yields on our invested cash and short-term
    investment balances. We expect that our interest expense will
    increase with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) FSP APB

No. 14-1,

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement)

. Please see “Newly Adopted and Recently
    Issued Accounting Pronouncements” below.

Interest expense is primarily related to the interest and
    amortization of issuance costs related to our 0.75% and
    1.00% Convertible Senior Notes issued in June 2006. Fiscal
    2007 also includes interest and accretion related to the
    0.25% Convertible Subordinated Notes that we assumed in
    connection with our acquisition of Veritas, which were paid in
    full during August 2006.

In fiscal 2008, we recorded a net gain from Settlements of

Other income, net includes a net gain of foreign currency for

Our effective tax rate was approximately (3)%, 35%, and 36% in
    fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The tax provision for
    fiscal 2009 includes a $56 million net tax benefit
    associated with the impairment of goodwill charge of
    $7.4 billion, materially impacting the overall effective
    tax rate. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 otherwise
    reflects the benefits of lower-taxed foreign earnings and losses
    from the joint venture, domestic manufacturing tax incentives,
    and research and development credits. The effective tax rate for
    fiscal 2008 reflects the impact of non-deductible stock-based
    compensation offset by U.S. tax benefits from domestic
    manufacturing deductions. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2007
    reflects the impact of non-deductible stock-based compensation
    offset by foreign earnings taxed at a lower rate than the
    U.S. tax rate.

The $56 million net tax benefit arising from the impairment
    of goodwill during the year consists of a $112 million tax
    benefit from elements of tax deductible goodwill, net of a
    $56 million tax provision to increase our valuation
    allowances for certain deferred tax assets in a foreign
    jurisdiction that will require an extended period of time to
    realize. The valuation allowance increased by $63 million
    in total in fiscal 2009 and totals $101 million as of
    April 3, 2009.

As a result of the impairment of goodwill, we have cumulative
    pre-tax book losses, as measured by the current and prior two
    years. We considered the negative evidence of this cumulative
    pre-tax book loss position on our ability to continue to
    recognize deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future
    taxable income for realization. Levels of



future taxable income are subject to the various risks and
    uncertainties discussed in Part I, Item 1A,

Risk
    Factors,

set forth in this annual report. We considered the
    following as positive evidence: the vast majority of the
    goodwill impairment is not deductible for tax purposes and thus
    will not result in tax losses; we have a strong, consistent
    taxpaying history; we have substantial U.S. federal income
    tax carryback potential; and we have substantial amounts of
    scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from
    our deferred tax liabilities. We have concluded that this
    positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and, thus,
    that the deferred tax assets as of April 3, 2009 of
    $702 million, after application of the valuation
    allowances, are realizable on a “more likely than not”
    basis.

Other
    tax matters

On March 29, 2006, we received a Notice of Deficiency from
    the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) claiming that we
    owe $867 million of additional taxes, excluding interest
    and penalties, for the 2000 and 2001 tax years based on an audit
    of Veritas. On June 26, 2006, we filed a petition with the
    U.S. Tax Court protesting the IRS claim for such additional
    taxes. In the March 2007 quarter, we agreed to pay
    $7 million out of $35 million originally assessed by
    the IRS in connection with several of the lesser issues covered
    in the assessment. The IRS agreed to waive the assessment of
    penalties. During July 2008, we completed the trial phase of the
    Tax Court case, which dealt with the remaining issue covered in
    the assessment. At trial, the IRS changed its position with
    respect to this remaining issue, decreasing the remaining amount
    at issue from $832 million to $545 million, excluding
    interest. We filed our post-trial briefs in October 2008 and
    rebuttal briefs in November 2008 with the U.S. Tax Court.

We strongly believe the IRS’ position with regard to this
    matter is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and existing
    Treasury regulations, and that our previously reported income
    tax provision for the years in question is appropriate. If, upon
    resolution, the final assessment differs from our tax provision
    the adjustment, including interest, would be accounted for
    through income tax expense in the period the matter is resolved,
    with the application of SFAS No. 141(Revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS No. 141(R)”) effective in the
    first quarter of our fiscal year 2010.

On March 30, 2006, we received notices of proposed
    adjustments from the IRS with regard to an unrelated audit of
    Symantec for fiscal 2003 and 2004. The IRS claimed that we owed
    an incremental tax liability with regard to this audit of
    $110 million, excluding penalties and interest. The
    incremental tax liability primarily relates to transfer pricing
    matters between Symantec and a foreign subsidiary. On
    September 5, 2006, we executed a closing agreement with the
    IRS with respect to the audit of Symantec’s fiscal 2003 and
    2004 federal income tax returns. The closing agreement
    represents the final assessment by the IRS of additional tax for
    these fiscal years of approximately $35 million, including
    interest. Based on the final settlement, a tax benefit of
    $8 million was recognized.

In July 2008, we reached an agreement with the IRS concerning
    our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made
    from a Veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the July 2005
    acquisition. The distribution was intended to be made pursuant
    to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and therefore
    eligible for a 5.25% effective U.S. federal rate of tax, in
    lieu of the 35% statutory rate. The final impact of this
    agreement is not yet known since this relates to the taxability
    of earnings that are otherwise the subject of the tax years

2000-2001

transfer pricing dispute which in turn is being addressed in the
    U.S. Tax Court. To the extent that we owe taxes as a result
    of the transfer pricing dispute, we anticipate that the
    incremental tax due from this negotiated agreement will
    decrease. We currently estimate that the most probable outcome
    from this negotiated agreement will be $13 million or less,
    for which an accrual has already been made. We made a payment of
    $130 million to the IRS for this matter in May 2006. We
    have applied $110 million of this payment as a deposit on
    the outstanding transfer pricing matter for the tax years

2000-2001.

In connection with the note hedge transactions discussed in
    Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
    this annual report, we established a deferred tax asset of
    approximately $232 million to account for the book-tax
    basis difference in the convertible notes resulting from note
    hedge transactions. The establishment of the deferred tax asset
    has been accounted for as an increase to additional paid-in
    capital. As a result of the adoption of FSP APB

No. 14-1

in the June 2009 quarter, book and tax basis in the convertible
    notes will be comparable, and as a result, this deferred tax
    asset will be adjusted through additional paid-in capital, as
    part of the adoption.



The Company adopted the provisions of FASB FIN 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,

effective
    March 31, 2007. FIN 48 addresses the accounting for
    and disclosure of uncertainty in income tax positions, by
    prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position
    is required to satisfy before being recognized in the financial
    statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
    measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
    in interim periods, disclosure and transition.

The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 was a decrease in
    tax reserves of $16 million, resulting in a decrease in
    Veritas goodwill of $10 million, an increase of
    $5 million to Accumulated earnings balance, and a
    $1 million increase in Additional paid-in capital. Upon
    adoption, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits as
    of March 31, 2007 was $456 million, exclusive of
    interest and penalties.

On February 5, 2008, Symantec formed Huawei-Symantec, Inc.
    (“joint venture”) with a subsidiary of Huawei
    Technologies Co., Ltd. (“Huawei”). The joint venture
    is domiciled in Hong Kong with principal operations in Chengdu,
    China. The joint venture develops, manufactures, markets and
    supports security and storage appliances to global
    telecommunications carriers and enterprise customers.

As described further in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in this annual report, we account for our
    investment in the joint venture under the equity method of
    accounting. Under this method, we record our proportionate share
    of the joint venture’s net income or loss based on the
    quarterly financial statements of the joint venture. We record
    our proportionate share of net income or loss one quarter in
    arrears. For the fiscal 2009, we recorded a loss of
    approximately $53 million related to our share of the joint
    venture’s net loss incurred for the period from
    February 5, 2008 (its date of inception) to
    December 31, 2008.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Sources
    of Cash

We have historically relied primarily on cash flows from
    operations, borrowings under a credit facility, issuances of
    convertible notes and equity securities for our liquidity needs.
    Key sources of cash include earnings from operations and
    existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and our
    revolving credit facility.

In fiscal 2007, we entered into a five-year $1 billion
    senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in July
    2011. During fiscal 2008, we borrowed $200 million under
    the credit facility. In order to be able to draw on the credit
    facility, we must maintain certain covenants, including a
    specified ratio of debt to earnings (before interest, taxes,
    depreciation, and amortization and impairments) as well as
    various other non-financial covenants. As of April 3, 2009,
    we were in compliance with all required covenants, and there was
    no outstanding balance on the credit facility.

As of April 3, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents of
    $1.8 billion and short-term investments of
    $199 million resulting in a net liquidity position, defined
    as unused availability of the credit facility, cash and cash
    equivalents and short-term investments, of approximately
    $3.0 billion.

We believe that our existing cash balances, cash that we
    generate over time from operations, and our borrowing capacity
    will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for
    working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next
    12 months.



Uses of
    Cash

Our principal cash requirements include working capital, capital
    expenditures, payments of principal and interest on our debt and
    payments of taxes. In addition, we regularly evaluate our
    ability to repurchase stock, pay debts and acquire other
    businesses.

Revolving credit facility.

In early fiscal
    2009, we repaid the entire $200 million principal amount,
    plus $3 million of accrued interest, that we borrowed
    during fiscal 2008 under our senior unsecured revolving credit
    facility.

Acquisition-Related.

We generally use cash to
    fund the acquisition of other businesses and from time to time
    use our revolving credit facility when necessary. We acquired
    six companies for cash totaling $1.1 billion in fiscal
    2009, three companies for approximately $1.4 billion in
    fiscal 2008 and two companies for approximately $46 million
    in fiscal 2007. Also in fiscal 2008, we entered into a joint
    venture with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and contributed
    $150 million in cash.

Convertible Senior Notes.

In June 2006, we
    issued $1.1 billion principal amount of
    0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2011, and
    $1.0 billion principal amount of 1.00% Convertible
    Senior Notes (collectively the “Senior Notes”) due
    June 15, 2013, to initial purchasers in a private offering
    for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to SEC
    Rule 144A. Concurrently with the issuance of the Senior
    Notes, we entered into note hedge transactions for
    $592 million with affiliates of certain of the initial
    purchasers whereby we have the option to purchase up to
    110 million shares of our common stock at a price of $19.12
    per share.

Stock Repurchases.

During fiscal 2009, we
    repurchased 42 million shares, or $700 million, of our
    common stock. As of April 3, 2009, we have
    $300 million remaining under the plan authorized by the
    Board of Directors in June 2007. During fiscal 2008, we
    repurchased a total of 81 million shares, or
    $1.5 billion, of our common stock. During fiscal 2007, we
    repurchased 162 million shares, or $2.8 billion, of
    our common stock.

Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.7 billion
    during fiscal 2009 primarily resulted from non-cash charges
    related to depreciation and amortization expenses of
    $837 million and the $7.4 billion goodwill impairment
    charge offset by the net loss of $6.7 billion.

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2008
    resulted largely from net income of $464 million adjusted
    for non-cash items — depreciation and amortization
    charges of $824 million, stock-based compensation expense
    of $164 million, income taxes payable of $197 million
    and an increase in deferred revenue of $127 million. These
    2008 amounts were partially offset by a decrease in non-cash
    deferred income taxes of $180 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2007
    resulted largely from net income of $404 million adjusted
    for non-cash items — depreciation and amortization of
    $811 million, stock-based compensation expense of
    $154 million and an increase in deferred revenue of
    $400 million. These 2007 amounts were partially offset by a
    decrease in income taxes payable of $182 million, primarily
    due to the timing of tax payments.



Investing
    Activities

Net cash used in investing activities of $1.0 billion in
    fiscal 2009 was primarily due to an aggregate payment of
    $1.1 billion in cash payments for acquisitions, net of cash
    acquired, and $272 million paid for capital expenditures,
    partially offset by net proceeds of $336 million from the
    sale of short-term investments which were used to partially fund
    acquisitions.

Net cash used in investing activities of $1.5 billion for
    2008 was primarily related to an aggregate payment of
    $1.2 billion in cash paid for acquisitions and the joint
    venture, net of cash acquired.

Net cash used in investing activities of $222 million in
    fiscal 2007 was primarily due to a net increase in capital
    expenditures of $298 million and $46 million in cash
    paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, partially offset by
    the net proceeds from sales of short-term investments of
    $123 million.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash used in financing activities of $676 million in
    fiscal 2009 was primarily due to stock repurchases of
    42 million shares of our common stock for $700 million
    and the repayment of $200 million on our revolving credit
    facility, partially offset by net proceeds of $229 million
    received from the issuance of our common stock through employee
    stock plans.

Net cash used in financing activities of $1.1 billion in
    fiscal 2008 was primarily related to the repurchase of
    81 million shares of our common stock for
    $1.5 billion, partially offset by the net proceeds of
    $224 million received from the issuance of our common stock
    through employee stock plans and a borrowing of
    $200 million on our revolving credit facility.

Net cash used in financing activities of $1.3 billion in
    fiscal 2007 was primarily related to the repurchase of
    162 million shares of our common stock for
    $2.8 billion, the purchase of note hedges for
    $592 million and repayment of the Veritas notes for
    $520 million; partially offset by $2.1 billion
    proceeds from the issuance of our Senior Notes, proceeds from
    the sale of common stock warrants of $326 million and
    $230 million proceeds from the issuance of our common stock
    through employee stock plans.

Senior Notes are due in fiscal 2012 and 2014. Holders of the
    Senior Notes may convert their Senior Notes prior to maturity
    upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion,
    we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number
    of shares of our common stock, up to the principal amount of the
    note. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be
    paid in cash or in stock at our option. As of April 3,
    2009, the conditions to conversion had not been met. Interest
    payments were calculated based on terms of the related notes.



Indemnifications

As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we
    indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or
    occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at
    our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of
    future payments we could be required to make under these
    indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have
    directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage that
    reduces our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of
    any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of
    these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable
    insurance coverage is minimal.

We provide limited product warranties and the majority of our
    software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify
    licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from
    claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual
    property rights of a third party. Historically, payments made
    under these provisions have been immaterial. We monitor the
    conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a
    loss has occurred.

Newly
    Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In April 2009, the FASB issued (1) FSP

FAS 115-2

and FSP

FAS 124-2,

which provides guidance on determining

other-than-temporary

impairments for debt securities; and (2) FSP

FAS 107-1

and FSP APB

28-1,

which
    provides additional fair value disclosures for financial
    instruments in interim periods. Each of these FSPs are effective
    for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009.
    We do not expect the adoption of these FSPs to have a material
    impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2008, the FASB issued EITF Issue

No. 07-5,

Determining Whether an Instrument (or an Embedded Feature) Is
    Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock

. EITF Issue

No. 07-5

provides guidance on evaluating whether an equity-linked
    financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to a
    company’s own stock, including evaluating the
    instrument’s contingent exercise and settlement provisions.
    EITF Issue

No. 07-5

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. We are currently assessing the impact of EITF Issue

No. 07-5

on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB

No. 14-1,

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement)

. The FSP will require the issuer of convertible
    debt instruments with cash settlement features to separately
    account for the liability and equity components of the
    instrument. The debt will be recognized at the present value of
    its cash flows discounted using the issuer’s nonconvertible
    debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance. The equity
    component will be recognized as the difference between the
    proceeds from the issuance of the note and the fair value of the
    liability. The FSP will also require interest to be accreted as
    interest expense of the resultant debt discount over the
    expected life of the debt.



The transition guidance requires retrospective application to
    all periods presented, and does not grandfather existing
    instruments. The guidance will be effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods
    within those years. As such, we will adopt the FSP in the first
    quarter of fiscal year 2010. Our 0.75% Convertible Senior
    Notes due June 15, 2011, and our 1.00% Convertible
    Senior Notes due June 15, 2013 (collectively the
    “Senior Notes”), each issued in June 2006, are subject
    to the FSP.

Upon adoption, we will record a debt discount, which will be
    amortized to interest expense through maturity of the Senior
    Notes. Although we have not completed our evaluation of the
    impact of adoption, we expect to retrospectively adjust the
    original carrying amount of the Senior Notes as of June 2006 to
    reflect a discount of approximately $586 million on the
    date of issuance, with an offsetting increase in additional
    paid-in capital of approximately $354 million and a
    decrease in deferred tax assets of approximately
    $232 million. Excluding the corresponding impact of income
    taxes, we expect to retrospectively record an increase in
    non-cash interest expense of approximately $91 million in
    fiscal 2008 and approximately $97 million in fiscal 2009.
    As a result of applying the FSP, we also expect non-cash
    interest expense in fiscal 2010 to increase by approximately
    $104 million, excluding the corresponding impact of income
    taxes. The additional non-cash interest expense will have no
    impact on the total operating, investing and financing cash
    flows in prior periods or in future consolidated statements of
    cash flows. If future interpretations of, or changes to, the FSP
    necessitate a further change in these reporting practices, our
    previously reported and future results of operations could be
    adversely affected.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162,

The
    Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

SFAS No. 162 defines the order in which accounting
    principles that are generally accepted should be followed.
    SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days following the
    SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (“PCAOB”) amendments to AU Section 411,

The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally
    Accepted Accounting Principles

. We do not expect the
    adoption of SFAS No. 162 to have a material impact on
    our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2008, the FASB finalized FSP

No. 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets.

The position amends the factors that should be considered in
    developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine
    the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB
    SFAS No. 142. The position applies to intangible
    assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other
    assets and both intangible assets acquired in business
    combinations and asset acquisitions.

FSP 142-3

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are
    currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of

FSP 142-3

on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51.

The standard
    changes the accounting for noncontrolling (minority) interests
    in consolidated financial statements including the requirements
    to classify noncontrolling interests as a component of
    consolidated stockholders’ equity, to identify earnings
    attributable to noncontrolling interests reported as part of
    consolidated earnings, and to measure gain or loss on the
    deconsolidated subsidiary using the fair value of the
    noncontrolling equity investment. Additionally,
    SFAS No. 160 revises the accounting for both increases
    and decreases in a parent’s controlling ownership interest.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited. We
    do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 to have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R).
    This standard changes the accounting for business combinations
    by requiring that an acquiring entity measures and recognizes
    identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the
    acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions. The changes
    include the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs,
    the valuation of any noncontrolling interest at acquisition date
    fair value, the recording of acquired contingent liabilities at
    acquisition date fair value and the subsequent re-measurement of
    such liabilities after acquisition date, the recognition of
    capitalized in-process research and development, the accounting
    for acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals subsequent
    to the acquisition date, and the recognition of changes in the
    acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance.
    SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, with early adoption
    prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact of the
    pending adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) on our
    consolidated financial statements. The accounting treatment
    related to pre-acquisition uncertain tax positions will change
    when SFAS No. 141(R) becomes effective, which will be
    in the first quarter of



our fiscal year 2010. At such time, any changes to the
    recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions related to
    pre-acquisition periods will be recorded through income tax
    expense, where currently the accounting treatment would require
    any adjustment to be recognized through the purchase price. In
    April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 141(R)-1,

Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a
    Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies.

FSP
    No. FAS 141(R)-1 provides guidance on the accounting
    and disclosure of contingencies acquired or assumed in a
    business combination. FSP No. FAS 141(R)-1 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of the pending
    adoption of FSP No. FAS 141(R)-1 on our consolidated
    financial statements. See Note 14 for further details.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities, including an amendment of SFAS No. 115.

SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to
    measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at
    fair value and requires unrealized gains and losses on items for
    which the fair value option has been elected to be reported in
    earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007. Effective March 29,
    2008, we adopted SFAS 159, but we have not elected the fair
    value option for any eligible financial instruments as of
    April 3, 2009.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements,

which defines fair value,
    establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value
    measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance
    found in various prior accounting pronouncements and is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. 157-2,

The Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

, which
    delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those
    that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim
    periods within those fiscal years. These nonfinancial items
    include assets and liabilities such as reporting units measured
    at fair value in a goodwill impairment test and nonfinancial
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
    combination. Effective March 29, 2008, we adopted
    SFAS No. 157 for financial assets and liabilities
    recognized at fair value on a recurring basis. The partial
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 for financial assets and
    liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In
    October 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 157-3,

Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset Is Not Active

. FSP

No. FAS 157-3

provides examples to illustrate key considerations in
    determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market
    for that financial asset is not active. FSP

No. FAS 157-3

is effective upon issuance. The adoption of the FSP did not have
    a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In
    April 2009, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 157-4,

Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity
    for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and
    Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly.

FSP

No. FAS 157-4

provides guidance on estimating fair value when the volume and
    level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly
    decreased and determining when a transaction is not orderly. FSP

No. FAS 157-4

is effective for interim and annual periods ending after
    June 15, 2009. We do not expect adoption of the FSP to have
    a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See
    Note 2 for information and related disclosures regarding
    our fair value measurements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations
    in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity
    prices. We may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate
    certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign
    exchange policies. We do not use derivatives or other financial
    instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our
    short-term investment portfolio and the potential losses arising
    from changes in interest rates. Our investment objective is to
    achieve the maximum return compatible with capital preservation
    and our liquidity requirements. Our strategy is to invest our
    cash in a manner that preserves capital, maintains sufficient
    liquidity to meet our cash requirements, maximizes yields
    consistent with approved credit risk, and limits inappropriate
    concentrations of investment by sector, credit, or issuer. We
    classify our cash equivalents and short-term investments in
    accordance with SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for
    Certain Investments in



Debt and Equity Securities.

We consider investments in
    instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days
    or less to be cash equivalents. We classify our short-term
    investments as

available-for-sale,

and short-term investments consist of marketable debt or equity
    securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days.
    Our cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolios
    consist primarily of money market funds, commercial paper,
    corporate debt securities, and U.S. government and
    government-sponsored debt securities. Our short-term investments
    do not include equity investments in privately held companies.
    Our short-term investments are reported at fair value with
    unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in Accumulated
    other comprehensive income within Stockholders’ equity in
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amortization of premiums
    and discounts on the investments, realized gains and losses, and
    declines in value judged to be

other-than-temporary

on

available-for-sale

securities are included in Other income, net in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. We use the specific identification
    method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and
    losses upon sale of short-term investments.

The following table presents the fair value and hypothetical
    changes in fair values on short-term investments sensitive to
    changes in interest rates (in millions):

The modeling technique used above measures the change in fair
    market value arising from selected potential changes in interest
    rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel
    shifts in the yield curve of plus 150 bps, plus
    100 bps, plus 50 bps, minus 25 bps, and minus
    75 bps.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We conduct business in 40 currencies through our worldwide
    operations and, as such, we are exposed to foreign currency
    exposure risk. Foreign currency risks are associated with our
    cash and cash equivalents, investments, receivables, and
    payables denominated in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in
    exchange rates will result in foreign exchange gains and losses
    on these foreign currency assets and liabilities and are
    included in Other income, net. Our objective in managing foreign
    exchange activity is to preserve stockholder value by minimizing
    the risk of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Our strategy
    is to primarily utilize forward contracts to hedge foreign
    currency exposures. Under our program, gains and losses in our
    foreign currency exposures are offset by losses and gains on our
    forward contracts. Our forward contracts generally have terms of
    one to six months. At the end of the reporting period, open
    contracts are marked-to-market with unrealized gains and losses
    included in Other income, net.

The following table presents a sensitivity analysis on our
    foreign forward exchange contract portfolio using a statistical
    model to estimate the potential gain or loss in fair value that
    could arise from hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of
    foreign currency (in millions):

Equity
    Price Risk

In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion principal amount of
    0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011 and
    $1.0 billion of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due
    2013. Holders may convert their Senior Notes prior to maturity
    upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion,
    we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number
    of shares of Symantec common stock, up to the principal amount
    of the note. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any,
    may be paid in cash or in stock at our option. Concurrent with
    the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered into convertible
    note hedge transactions and separately, warrant transactions, to
    reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the Senior
    Notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may
    have on the price of our common stock.

For business and strategic purposes, we also hold equity
    interests in several privately held companies, many of which can
    be considered to be in the

start-up

or
    development stages. These investments are inherently risky and
    we could lose a substantial part or our entire investment in
    these companies. These investments are recorded at cost and
    classified as Other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. As of April 3, 2009, these investments had an
    aggregate carrying value of $3 million.

We have a 52/53 — week fiscal accounting year. The
    first quarter of fiscal 2009 was comprised of 14 weeks
    while each of the other quarters presented were comprised of
    13 weeks.

(b)

During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, based on a combination
    of factors, there were sufficient indicators to require us to
    perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis. Based on the
    analysis performed, we concluded that an impairment loss was
    probable and could be reasonably estimated. Accordingly we
    recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately
    $7 billion. Upon finalizing our analysis, we recorded an
    additional non-cash goodwill impairment charge of
    $413 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. See
    Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements in this annual report.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

(a)

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The SEC defines the term “disclosure controls and
    procedures” to mean a company’s controls and other
    procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
    to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under
    the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and
    reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms. “Disclosure controls and procedures”
    include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
    ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in
    the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management,
    including its principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded, based on an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

of
    the Exchange Act) by our management, with the participation of
    our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
    that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
    the end of the period covered by this report.

(b)

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Exchange Act) for Symantec. Our management, with the
    participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
    Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of April 3, 2009, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”). We have excluded from our evaluation, the
    internal control over financial reporting of (a) PC Tools
    Pty. Ltd. and subsidiaries, which we acquired on October 6,
    2008, and is included in the fiscal 2009 consolidated financial
    statements of Symantec and constituted $310.5 million of
    total assets (of which $273.0 million represents goodwill
    and intangible assets included within the scope of the
    assessment), as of April 3, 2009, and $13.9 million of
    revenue, for the year then ended and (b) MessageLabs Group
    Limited and subsidiaries, which we acquired on November 14,
    2008, and is included in the fiscal year 2009 consolidated
    financial statements of Symantec and constituted
    $715.1 million of total assets (of which
    $640.1 million represents goodwill and intangible assets
    included within the scope of the assessment), as of
    April 3, 2009 and $37.8 million of revenues, for the
    year then ended.

Our management has concluded that, as of April 3, 2009, our
    internal control over financial reporting was effective based on
    these criteria.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
    has issued an attestation report regarding its assessment of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    April 3, 2009, which is included in Part IV,
    Item 15 of this annual report.

(c)

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting during the quarter ended April 3, 2009 that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(d)

Limitations
    on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
    and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors
    and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
    and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
    assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
    Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
    that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
    controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of
    the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
    of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
    issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have
    been detected.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements




REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Symantec Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries as of April 3, 2009
    and March 28, 2008, and the related consolidated statements
    of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each
    of the years in the three-year period ended April 3, 2009.
    In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
    statements we have also audited the related financial statement
    schedule listed in Item 15. These consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and
    financial statement schedule referred to above present fairly,
    in all material respects, the financial position of Symantec
    Corporation and subsidiaries as of April 3, 2009 and
    March 28, 2008, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
    ended April 3, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related
    financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
    basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
    presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
    forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective March 31, 2007, Symantec Corporation
    adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    April 3, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”), and our report dated May 29, 2009
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Symantec Corporation:

We have audited Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the
    “Company”) internal control over financial reporting
    as of April 3, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (“COSO”). The Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A(b). Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of April 3, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

Management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of April 3, 2009, (1) PC Tools Pty. Ltd. and
    subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting
    associated with total assets of $310.5 million (of which
    $273.0 million represents goodwill and intangible assets
    included within the scope of the assessment) as of April 3,
    2009 and total revenues of $13.9 million for the year then
    ended, and (2) MessageLabs Group Limited and
    subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting
    associated with total assets of $715.1 million (of which
    $640.1 million represents goodwill and intangible assets
    included within the scope of the assessment) as of April 3,
    2009 and total revenues of $37.8 million for the year then
    ended.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Symantec Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of April 3, 2009 and March 28, 2008,
    and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended April 3, 2009, and our
    report dated May 29, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion
    on those consolidated financial statements.

SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Symantec Corporation (“we,” “us,” and
    “our” refer to Symantec Corporation and all of its
    subsidiaries) is a global leader in providing security, storage
    and systems management solutions to help businesses and
    consumers secure and manage their information. We provide
    customers worldwide with software and services that protect,
    manage and control information risks related to security, data
    protection, storage, compliance, and systems management. We help
    our customers manage cost, complexity and compliance by
    protecting their IT infrastructure as they seek to maximize
    value from their IT investments.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Symantec
    Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are prepared in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
    United States. All significant intercompany accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior year amounts
    have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Fiscal
    Years

We have a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to
    March 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to years in
    this report relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years.

Fiscal Year

Ended

Weeks


April 3, 2009



March 28, 2008



March 30, 2007


The fiscal year ending April 2, 2010 will comprise
    52 weeks of operating results.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
    United States requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
    financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based
    upon historical factors, current circumstances and the
    experience and judgment of management. Management evaluates its
    assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may engage
    outside subject matter experts to assist in its valuations.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant
    items subject to such estimates and assumptions include those
    related to the allocation of revenues between recognized and
    deferred amounts, fair value of financial instruments, valuation
    of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets, valuation
    of stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation, and
    the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally
    the local currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in
    foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate on the
    balance sheet dates. Revenues and expenses are translated using
    monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the year. The
    translation adjustments resulting from this process are included
    as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income.
    Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in
    Other income, net. When legal entities are liquidated,
    reclassification translation adjustments are made from
    Accumulated comprehensive income to Other income, net. Deferred
    tax assets (liabilities) are established on the cumulative
    translation adjustment attributable to unremitted foreign
    earnings that are not intended to be indefinitely reinvested.



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Revenue
    Recognition

We market and distribute our software products both as
    stand-alone software products and as integrated product suites.
    We recognize revenue when 1) persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists, 2) delivery has occurred or services
    have been rendered, 3) fees are fixed or determinable and
    4) collectibility is probable. If we determine that any one
    of the four criteria is not met, we will defer recognition of
    revenue until all the criteria are met.

We derive revenue primarily from sales of content,
    subscriptions, maintenance and licenses. We present revenue net
    of sales taxes and any similar assessments.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue includes
    arrangements for software maintenance and technical support for
    our products, content and subscription services primarily
    related to our security products, revenue from arrangements
    where vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of
    the fair value of undelivered elements does not exist,
    arrangements for managed security services, and
    Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) offerings. These
    arrangements are generally offered to our customers over a
    specified period of time, and we recognize the related revenue
    ratably over the maintenance, subscription, or service period.

Content, subscriptions, and maintenance revenue also includes
    professional services revenue, which consists primarily of the
    fees we earn related to consulting and educational services. We
    generally recognize revenue from professional services as the
    services are performed or upon written acceptance from
    customers, if applicable, assuming all other conditions for
    revenue recognition noted above have been met.

License revenue is derived primarily from the licensing of our
    various products and technology. We generally recognize license
    revenue upon delivery of the product, assuming all other
    conditions for revenue recognition noted above have been met.

We enter into perpetual software license agreements through
    direct sales to customers and indirect sales with distributors
    and resellers. The license agreements generally include product
    maintenance agreements, for which the related revenue is
    included with Content, subscriptions, and maintenance and is
    deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the
    agreements.

In arrangements that include multiple elements, including
    perpetual software licenses and maintenance

and/or

services and packaged products with content updates, we allocate
    and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on VSOE of
    fair value of the undelivered elements, and recognize the
    difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount
    deferred for the undelivered items as license revenue. VSOE of
    each element is based on the price for which the undelivered
    element is sold separately. We determine fair value of the
    undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our
    stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the
    stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements. When VSOE does
    not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance, the entire
    arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance
    period. Our deferred revenue consists primarily of the
    unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance, consumer
    product content update subscriptions, and arrangements where
    VSOE does not exist.

Indirect
    channel sales

For our Consumer segment, we sell packaged software products
    through a multi-tiered distribution channel. We also sell
    electronic download and packaged products via the Internet. We
    separately sell annual content update subscriptions directly to
    end-users primarily via the Internet. For our consumer products
    that include content updates, we recognize revenue for these
    products ratably over the term of the subscription upon
    sell-through to end-users, as the subscription period commences
    upon sale to an end-user. For most other consumer products, we
    recognize package product revenue on distributor and reseller
    channel inventory that is not in excess of specified inventory
    levels in these channels. We offer the right of return of our
    products under various policies and programs with our
    distributors, resellers, and end-user customers. We estimate and
    record reserves for product returns as an



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

offset to revenue. We fully reserve for obsolete products in the
    distribution channel as an offset to deferred revenue for
    products with content updates and to revenue for all other
    products.

For our Security and Compliance and Storage and Server
    Management segments, we generally recognize revenue from the
    licensing of software products through our indirect sales
    channel upon sell-through to an end-user. For licensing of our
    software to OEMs, royalty revenue is recognized when the OEM
    reports the sale of the software products to an end-user,
    generally on a quarterly basis. In addition to license
    royalties, some OEMs pay an annual flat fee

and/or

support royalties for the right to sell maintenance and
    technical support to the end-user. We recognize revenue from OEM
    support royalties and fees ratably over the term of the support
    agreement.

We offer channel and end-user rebates for our products. Our
    estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are
    based on distributors’ and resellers’ actual
    performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive
    rebate programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our
    reserves for end-user rebates are estimated based on the terms
    and conditions of the promotional program, actual sales during
    the promotion, the amount of actual redemptions received,
    historical redemption trends by product and by type of
    promotional program, and the value of the rebate. We estimate
    and record reserves for channel and end-user rebates as an
    offset to revenue. For consumer products that include content
    updates, rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue
    over the term of the subscription.

Financial
    Instruments

For certain of our financial instruments, including cash and
    cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable,
    accounts payable and other current liabilities, the carrying
    amounts approximate their fair value due to the relatively short
    maturity of these balances. The following methods were used to
    estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments
    for which it is practicable to estimate that value:

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

We consider all
    highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
    months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are
    recognized at fair value. As of April 3, 2009, our cash
    equivalents consisted of $479 million in government
    securities, $474 million in corporate securities and
    $389 million in money market funds. As of March 28,
    2008, our cash equivalents consisted of $734 million in
    commercial paper, $527 million in money market funds and
    $45 million in corporate securities.

Short-Term Investments.

We classify short-term
    investments in accordance with SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
    Securities.

Short-term investments consist of
    marketable debt or equity securities which are classified as

available-for-sale

and are recognized at fair value. The determination of fair
    value is further detailed in Note 2. Our portfolios consist
    of asset-backed securities, corporate securities, government
    notes, and marketable equity securities. We regularly review our
    investment portfolio according to FSP

FAS 115-1,

The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its
    Application to Certain Investments

. We identify and evaluate
    investments that have indications of possible impairment.
    Factors considered in determining whether a loss is

other-than-temporary

include: the length of time and extent to which the fair market
    value has been lower than the cost basis, the financial
    condition and near-term prospects of the investee, credit
    quality, likelihood of recovery, and our ability to hold the
    investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any
    anticipated recovery in fair market value.

Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in
    Accumulated other comprehensive income. The amortization of
    premiums and discounts on the investments, realized gains and
    losses, and declines in value judged to be

other-than-temporary

on

available-for-sale

securities are included in Other income, net. We use the
    specific-identification method to determine cost in calculating
    realized gains and losses upon sale of short-term investments.

Derivative Instruments.

We transact business
    in various foreign currencies and have foreign currency risks
    associated with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
    foreign currencies. We utilize foreign currency forward
    contracts to reduce the risks associated with changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates. Our forward contracts generally have
    terms of one to six months. We do not use forward contracts for
    trading purposes. The gains



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

and losses on the contracts are intended to offset the gains and
    losses on the underlying transactions. Both the changes in fair
    value of outstanding forward contracts and realized foreign
    exchange gains and losses are included in Other income, net.
    Contract fair values are determined based upon quoted prices for
    identical foreign currencies in other markets from brokers. For
    each fiscal year presented in this report, outstanding
    derivative contracts and the related gains or losses were not
    material.

Convertible senior notes, note hedge and revolving credit
    facility.

Our convertible senior notes were
    recorded at cost based upon par value at issuance. Debt issuance
    costs were recorded in Other long-term assets and are being
    amortized to Interest expense using the effective interest
    method over five years for the 0.75% Notes and seven years
    for the 1.00% Notes. In conjunction with the issuance of
    the notes, we obtained hedges which would provide us with the
    option to purchase additional common shares at a fixed price
    from the note holders after conversion. The cost incurred in
    connection with the note hedge transaction, net of the related
    tax benefit and the proceeds from the sale of warrants, was
    included as a net reduction in Additional paid-in capital.
    Borrowings under our $1 billion senior unsecured revolving
    credit facility are generally recognized at cost plus accrued
    interest based upon stated interest rates.

Trade
    Accounts Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
    and are not interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for
    doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible trade
    receivables. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts
    are recorded as General and administrative expenses. We review
    our trade receivables by aging category to identify specific
    customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In
    addition, we maintain an allowance for all other receivables not
    included in the specific reserve by applying specific
    percentages of projected uncollectible receivables to the
    various aging categories. In determining these percentages, we
    analyze our historical collection experience and current
    economic trends. We exercise judgment when determining the
    adequacy of these reserves as we evaluate historical bad debt
    trends, general economic conditions in the U.S. and
    internationally, and changes in customer financial conditions.
    We also offset deferred revenue against accounts receivable when
    channel inventories are in excess of specified levels and for
    transactions where collection of a receivable is not considered
    probable. The following table summarizes trade accounts
    receivable, net of allowances and reserves for the periods

Equity
    Method Investments

We account for the Huawei-Symantec, Inc. joint venture
    (“joint venture”) under the equity method. Under the
    equity method, we record our proportionate share of the joint
    venture’s net loss, based on the quarterly financial
    statements of the joint venture. We record our proportionate
    share of the net loss one quarter in arrears. In determining our
    share of the joint venture’s net loss, we adjust the joint
    venture’s reported results to recognize the amortization
    expense associated with the difference between the carrying
    value of our investment in the joint venture and our
    proportionate share of the book value of the joint venture. Our
    proportionate share of net losses is included in the Loss from
    joint venture. See Note 7 for details.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
    principally determined using the

first-in,

first-out method. Inventory predominantly consists of finished
    goods as well as deferred costs of revenue. Deferred costs of
    revenue were $24 million as of April 3, 2009 and
    $32 million as of March 28, 2008, of which
    $17 million and $22 million, respectively, are related
    to consumer products that include content updates and will be
    recognized ratably over the term of the subscription.

Property
    and Equipment

Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements are stated at
    cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.
    Depreciation and amortization is provided on a straight-line
    basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
    Buildings are depreciated over 25 to 30 years, and
    leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the
    life of the improvement or the initial lease term. Computer
    hardware and software is depreciated over two to five years and
    office furniture and equipment is depreciated over a three to
    five-year period. The following table summarizes property and
    equipment by categories for the periods ending:

We account for acquisitions using the purchase method of
    accounting under SFAS No. 141(R). Each acquired
    company’s operating results are included in our
    consolidated financial statements starting on the date of
    acquisition. The purchase price is allocated to tangible and
    identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    as of the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognized for the
    remaining unallocated purchase price.

Amounts allocated to assets are based upon fair values. Such
    valuations require management to make significant estimates and
    assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.
    Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions
    believed to be reasonable. These estimates are based on
    historical experience and information obtained from the
    management of the acquired companies and are inherently
    uncertain. Other separately identifiable intangible assets
    generally include acquired product rights, developed technology,
    customer lists and tradenames. We did not acquire in-process
    research and development (“IPR&D”) in the fiscal
    years 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Amounts allocated to liabilities assumed are based upon present
    values of amounts to be paid determined at current market rates.
    We estimate the fair value of deferred revenue related to
    product support assumed in connection with acquisitions. The
    estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by
    estimating the costs



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit
    margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the support contracts are
    based on the historical direct costs related to providing the
    support.

For any given acquisition, we may identify certain
    pre-acquisition contingencies. If the contingency is probable
    and can be reasonably estimated within the purchase price
    allocation period, generally within one year after acquisition,
    an adjustment is recorded to goodwill. If the contingency is not
    probable or cannot be reasonably estimated at the end of the
    purchase price allocation period, the adjustment is recorded in
    operating results in the period in which the adjustment is
    determined.

Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

Goodwill.

Our methodology for allocating the
    purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined
    through established valuation techniques. Goodwill is measured
    as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the sum of the
    amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets
    acquired less liabilities assumed. We review goodwill for
    impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of the
    fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. In
    testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we determine the
    carrying value (book value) of the assets and liabilities for
    each reporting unit, which requires the allocation of goodwill
    to each reporting unit. We then estimate the fair value of each
    reporting unit. The first step of evaluating impairment is to
    determine if the estimated fair value is greater than the
    carrying value of each reporting unit. If step one indicates
    that impairment potentially exists, the second step is performed
    to measure the amount of impairment, if any. Goodwill impairment
    exists when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than
    its carrying value.

To determine the reporting units’ fair values in the
    current year analyses, we used the income approach under which
    we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the
    estimated discounted future cash flows of that reporting unit.
    The results thereof are corroborated with the market approach
    which measures the value of an asset through an analysis of
    recent sales or offerings of comparable property. When applied
    to the valuation of equity interests, consideration is given to
    the financial condition and operating performance of the company
    being appraised relative to those of publicly traded companies
    operating in the same or similar lines of business, potentially
    subject to corresponding economic, environmental, and political
    factors and considered to be reasonable investment alternatives.
    We also consider our market capitalization on the date of the
    analysis. The methodology applied in the current year analysis
    was consistent with the methodology applied in the prior year
    analysis, but was based on updated assumptions, as appropriate.

Our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted
    revenue, operating costs and other relevant factors. To
    determine the reporting units’ carrying values in the
    current year evaluations, we allocated them based on either
    specific identification or by using judgment for those assets
    and liabilities that are not held by reporting units but rather
    by functional departments. Goodwill was allocated to the
    reporting units based on a combination of specific
    identification and relative fair values, which is consistent
    with the methodology utilized in the prior year impairment
    analysis. The use of relative fair values was necessary for
    certain reporting units due to changes in our operating
    structure in prior years. The process of evaluating the
    potential impairment of goodwill requires significant judgment
    at many points during the analysis, including determining the
    carrying value of the reporting units and calculating fair value
    of each reporting unit based on estimated future cash flows and
    discount rates to be applied.

Prior to performing our second step in the goodwill impairment
    analysis, we perform an assessment of long-lived assets for
    impairment. Such long-lived assets include tangible and
    intangible assets recorded in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144,

Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets

and SFAS No. 86,

Accounting for the
    Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
    Marketed

.

As defined in SFAS No. 142, we perform our goodwill
    impairment analysis at the reporting unit level, which are the
    same as our operating segments, with the exception of the
    Services operating segment. We determined that



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

the Services operating segment was comprised of two components
    that each represented a reporting unit: SaaS and Services.

Intangible Assets.

In connection with our
    acquisitions, we generally recognize assets for customer
    relationships, developed technology or acquired product rights
    (purchased product rights, technologies, databases, patents, and
    contracts) and tradenames. Intangible assets and long-lived
    assets are recognized at cost less accumulated amortization.
    Amortization of intangible assets is provided on a straight-line
    basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets,
    generally from one to nine years. Amortization for acquired
    product rights is recognized in Cost of revenues. Amortization
    for customer lists and tradenames is recognized in Operating
    expenses.

On an interim basis, we ascertain triggering events for
    impairment of intangible assets and assess recoverability in
    accordance with SFAS No. 142 for intangible assets
    with indefinite lives or SFAS No. 144 for intangible
    assets with definite lives. To determine the recoverability of
    our definite-lived intangible assets, when indicators of an
    impairment are identified, we compare the carrying amounts
    against the estimated future cash flows related to the
    underlying group of assets. These estimates are based on company
    forecasts and are subject to change. We also evaluate net
    realizability of acquired product rights in accordance with
    SFAS No. 86.

Assets
    Held For Sale

Assets to be sold or disposed of are included in Other current
    assets and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair
    value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. We
    evaluate assets held for sale for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
    asset may not be recoverable in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144. If the estimated fair value is less than
    its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. The
    impairment loss is measured as the difference between the
    carrying amount of the asset and its fair value, which is
    estimated based on appraised market values or discounted cash
    flows expected to be generated by the asset. Impairment charges
    are included in “Impairment of assets held for sale.”
    The gain or loss on the sale of assets held for sale are
    included in nonoperating expenses.

Restructuring
    Liabilities

Upon approval of a restructuring plan by management with the
    appropriate level of authority, we record restructuring
    liabilities in accordance with SFAS No. 112,

Employers’ Accounting for Postemployment Benefits,

and SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs
    Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,

resulting in
    the recognition of employee severance and related termination
    benefits for recurring arrangements when they become probable
    and estimable and on the accrual basis for one-time benefit
    arrangements. We record other costs associated with exit
    activities as they are incurred.

Income
    Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. The
    provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and
    liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the financial
    reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for
    operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in each jurisdiction
    in which we operate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to
    taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets
    are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation
    allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is
    believed more likely than not to be realized.

We are required to compute our income taxes in each federal,
    state, and international jurisdiction in which we operate. This
    process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as
    well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and
    tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as
    accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax
    purposes. The income tax effects of the differences we identify
    are classified as



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

current or long-term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our judgments, assumptions, and
    estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take
    into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax
    laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits
    conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in
    tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of
    current and future tax audits could significantly impact the
    amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations. We must also
    assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized
    from future taxable income and, based on this assessment,
    establish a valuation allowance, if required. Our determination
    of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of
    assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including forecasted
    earnings, future taxable income, and the relative proportions of
    revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and
    international jurisdictions in which we operate. To the extent
    we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation
    allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a
    corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations, or to goodwill to the
    extent that the valuation allowance related to tax attributes of
    the acquired entities.

We adopted the provisions of FASB FIN 48, effective
    March 31, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
    income taxes, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a
    tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the
    financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
    derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
    transition.

FIN 48 prescribes a two-step process to determine the
    amount of tax benefit to be recognized. The first step is to
    evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
    weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely
    than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including
    resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
    The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax
    benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of
    being realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently
    difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this
    requires us to determine the probability of various possible
    outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a
    quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including,
    but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes
    in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new
    audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement
    would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an
    additional charge to the tax provision in the period.

Earnings
    Per Share

Earnings per share — basic and diluted are presented
    in conformity with SFAS No. 128,

Earnings Per
    Share

, for all periods presented. Earnings per
    share — basic is computed using the weighted-average
    number of common shares outstanding during the periods. Earnings
    per share — diluted is computed using the
    weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and
    potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the
    periods. Potentially dilutive common shares include the assumed
    exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method, the
    dilutive impact of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and
    warrants using the treasury stock method, and conversion of
    debt, if dilutive, in the period. See Note 8 for details of
    potentially dilutive common shares from debt instruments
    included in the calculation of Earnings per share —
    diluted.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

. Under the
    fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock-based
    compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair
    value of the award and is recognized as expense over the
    requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period
    of the respective award. No compensation cost is ultimately
    recognized for awards for which employees do not render the
    requisite service and are forfeited.

Fair Value of Stock-Based Awards.

We use the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value
    of stock options. The determination of the fair value of
    stock-based awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing
    model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions
    regarding a number of complex and



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock
    price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and
    projected employee stock option exercise and cancellation
    behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. We
    estimate the expected life of options granted based on an
    analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and
    post-vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the
    contractual life of the option. Expected volatility is based on
    the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate
    with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility
    of traded options. The risk free interest rate is equal to the
    U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal
    to the expected life. We do not currently pay cash dividends on
    our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the
    foreseeable future. Accordingly, our expected dividend yield is
    zero. The fair value of each RSU is equal to the market value of
    Symantec’s common stock on the date of grant. The fair
    value of each ESPP purchase right is equal to the 15% discount
    on shares purchased.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

A significant portion of our revenues and net (loss) income is
    derived from international sales and independent agents and
    distributors. Fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against
    foreign currencies, changes in local regulatory or economic
    conditions, piracy, or nonperformance by independent agents or
    distributors could adversely affect operating results.

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and
    cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade accounts
    receivable, and forward foreign exchange contracts. Our
    investment portfolio is diversified and consists of investment
    grade securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of
    credit risk exposure to any one issuer and in any one country.
    We are exposed to credit risks in the event of default by the
    issuers to the extent of the amount recorded in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. The credit risk in our trade accounts receivable
    is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process,
    reasonably short collection terms, and the geographical
    dispersion of sales transactions. We maintain reserves for
    potential credit losses and such losses have been within
    management’s expectations. See Note 12 for details of
    significant customers.

Advertising
    costs

Advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred and
    include electronic and print advertising, trade shows,
    collateral production, and all forms of direct marketing.
    Starting in January 2007, certain advertising contracts contain
    placement fee arrangements with escalation clauses which are
    expensed on an estimated average cost basis over the term of the
    arrangement. The difference between the actual placement fee
    paid and the estimated average placement fee cost is included in
    Other long-term liabilities for fiscal 2009 and 2008, which were
    $47 million and $71 million, respectively. Advertising
    costs included in Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2009,
    2008, and 2007 were $572 million, $555 million, and
    $382 million, respectively.

Newly
    Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In April 2009, the FASB issued (1) FSP

FAS 115-2

and FSP

FAS 124-2,

which provides guidance on determining

other-than-temporary

impairments for debt securities; and (2) FSP

FAS 107-1

and FSP APB

28-1,

which
    provides additional fair value disclosures for financial
    instruments in interim periods. Each of these FSPs are effective
    for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009.
    We do not expect the adoption of these FSPs to have a material
    impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2008, the FASB issued EITF Issue

No. 07-5,

Determining Whether an Instrument (or an Embedded Feature) Is
    Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock

. EITF Issue

No. 07-5

provides guidance on evaluating whether an equity-linked
    financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to a
    company’s own stock, including evaluating the
    instrument’s contingent exercise and settlement provisions.
    EITF Issue

No. 07-5

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,

No. 07-5

on our consolidated financial statements.



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB

No. 14-1,

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement)

. The FSP will require the issuer of convertible
    debt instruments with cash settlement features to separately
    account for the liability and equity components of the
    instrument. The debt will be recognized at the present value of
    its cash flows discounted using the issuer’s nonconvertible
    debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance. The equity
    component will be recognized as the difference between the
    proceeds from the issuance of the note and the fair value of the
    liability. The FSP will also require interest to be accreted as
    interest expense of the resultant debt discount over the
    expected life of the debt. The transition guidance requires
    retrospective application to all periods presented, and does not
    grandfather existing instruments. The guidance will be effective
    for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and
    interim periods within those years. As such, we will adopt the
    FSP in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Our
    0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2011, and
    our 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2013
    (collectively the “Senior Notes”), each issued in June
    2006, are subject to the FSP.

Upon adoption, we will record a debt discount, which will be
    amortized to interest expense through maturity of the Senior
    Notes. Although we have not completed our evaluation of the
    impact of adoption, we expect to retrospectively adjust the
    original carrying amount of the Senior Notes as of June 2006 to
    reflect a discount of approximately $586 million on the
    date of issuance, with an offsetting increase in additional
    paid-in capital of approximately $354 million and a
    decrease in deferred tax assets of approximately
    $232 million. Excluding the corresponding impact of income
    taxes, we expect to retrospectively record an increase in
    non-cash interest expense of approximately $91 million in
    fiscal 2008 and approximately $97 million in fiscal 2009.
    As a result of applying the FSP, we also expect non-cash
    interest expense in fiscal 2010 to increase by approximately
    $104 million, excluding the corresponding impact of income
    taxes. The additional non-cash interest expense will have no
    impact on the total operating, investing and financing cash
    flows in prior periods or in future consolidated statements of
    cash flows. If future interpretations of, or changes to, the FSP
    necessitate a further change in these reporting practices, our
    previously reported and future results of operations could be
    adversely affected.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162,

The
    Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

SFAS No. 162 defines the order in which accounting
    principles that are generally accepted should be followed.
    SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days following the
    SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (“PCAOB”) amendments to AU Section 411,

The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally
    Accepted Accounting Principles

. We do not expect the
    adoption of SFAS No. 162 to have a material impact on
    our consolidated financial statements.

In April 2008, the FASB finalized FSP

No. 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets.

The position amends the factors that should be considered in
    developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine
    the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FASB
    SFAS No. 142. The position applies to intangible
    assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other
    assets and both intangible assets acquired in business
    combinations and asset acquisitions.

FSP 142-3

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are
    currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of

FSP 142-3

on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements

—

an amendment of ARB
    No. 51.

The standard changes the accounting for
    noncontrolling (minority) interests in consolidated financial
    statements including the requirements to classify noncontrolling
    interests as a component of consolidated stockholders’
    equity, to identify earnings attributable to noncontrolling
    interests reported as part of consolidated earnings, and to
    measure gain or loss on the deconsolidated subsidiary using the
    fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment.
    Additionally, SFAS No. 160 revises the accounting for
    both increases and decreases in a parent’s controlling
    ownership interest. SFAS No. 160 is effective for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, with early
    adoption prohibited. We do not expect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 160 to have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements.



SYMANTEC

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R).
    This standard changes the accounting for business combinations
    by requiring that an acquiring entity measures and recognizes
    identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the
    acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions. The changes
    include the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs,
    the valuation of any noncontrolling interest at acquisition date
    fair value, the recording of acquired contingent liabilities at
    acquisition date fair value and the subsequent re-measurement of
    such liabilities after acquisition date, the recognition of
    capitalized in-process research and development, the accounting
    for acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals subsequent
    to the acquisition date, and the recognition of changes in the
    acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance.
    SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, with early adoption
    prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact of the
    pending adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) on our
    consolidated financial statements. The accounting treatment
    related to pre-acquisition uncertain tax positions will change
    when SFAS No. 141(R) becomes effective, which will be
    in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2010. At such time, any
    changes to the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax
    positions related to pre-acquisition periods will be recorded
    through income tax expense, where currently the accounting
    treatment would require any adjustment to be recognized through
    the purchase price. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP
    No. FAS 141(R)-1,

Accounting for Assets Acquired
    and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise
    from Contingencies.

FSP No. FAS 141(R)-1 provides
    guidance on the accounting and disclosure of contingencies
    acquired or assumed in a business combination. FSP
    No. FAS 141(R)-1 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently
    evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of FSP
    No. FAS 141(R)-1 on our consolidated financial
    statements. See Note 14 for further details.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities, including an amendment of SFAS No. 115.

SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to
    measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at
    fair value and requires unrealized gains and losses on items for
    which the fair value option has been elected to be reported in
    earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007. Effective March 29,
    2008, we adopted SFAS 159, but we have not elected the fair
    value option for any eligible financial instruments as of
    April 3, 2009.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

, which defines fair value,
    establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value
    measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance
    found in various prior accounting pronouncements and is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. 157-2,

The Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

, which
    delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those
    that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim
    periods within those fiscal years. These nonfinancial items
    include assets and liabilities such as reporting units measured
    at fair value in a goodwill impairment test and nonfinancial
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
    combination. Effective March 29, 2008, we adopted
    SFAS No. 157 for financial assets and liabilities
    recognized at fair value on a recurring basis. The partial
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 for financial assets and
    liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In
    October 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 157-3,

Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset Is Not Active

. FSP

No. FAS 157-3

provides examples to illustrate key considerations in
    determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market
    for that financial asset is not active. FSP

No. FAS 157-3

is effective upon issuance. The adoption of the FSP did not have
    a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In
    April 2009, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 157-4,

Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity
    for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and
    Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly.

FSP

No. FAS 157-4

provides guidance on estimating fair value when the volume and
    level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly
    decreased and determining when a transaction is not orderly. FSP

No. FAS 157-4

is effective for interim and annual periods ending after
    June 15, 2009. We do not expect adoption of the FSP to have
    a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See
    Note 2 for information and related disclosures regarding
    our fair value measurements.

Fair
    Value Measurements

We measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value based
    upon exit price, representing the amount that would be received
    on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability, as the
    case may be, in an orderly transaction between market
    participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions
    that market participants would use in pricing an asset or
    liability. SFAS No. 157 (as impacted by FSP Nos.

157-1,

157-2

and

157-3)

establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on
    either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in
    valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The
    following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair
    value:

•

Level 1:

Observable inputs that reflect
    quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities
    in active markets.

•

Level 2:

Inputs reflect quoted prices for
    identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;
    quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
    markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for
    the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived
    principally from or corroborated by observable market data by
    correlation or other means.

•

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs reflecting
    our own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to
    determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be
    consistent with market participant assumptions that are
    reasonably available.

The following table summarizes our financial assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by
    level within the fair value hierarchy:

Certain financial assets and liabilities are not included in the

    during the year ended April 3, 2009. These include our
    convertible Senior Notes and bond hedge (including the
    derivative call option).

FSP

FAS No. 157-2,

which measures fair value of nonfinancial assets and liabilities
    which are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a
    nonrecurring basis, will be effective beginning in fiscal 2010.
    This deferral applies to us for such items as nonfinancial
    assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a
    business combination but not measured at fair value in
    subsequent periods, nonfinancial long-lived and intangible asset
    groups measured at fair value for an impairment assessment and
    reporting units measured at fair value as part of a goodwill
    impairment test.

We sold properties and a business for cash proceeds of
    $40 million and $98 million during fiscal 2009 and
    2008, respectively. The loss on the sale of the business was
    $95 million and is included in Impairments of assets held
    for sale. The gain and the loss on the sales of properties were
    not significant.

(2)

Due to changing real estate market conditions and a review of
    our real estate holdings, we decided to retain two properties
    previously held for sale. As a result, we reclassified these
    properties to Property and equipment.

SFAS No. 144 provides that a long-lived asset
    classified as held for sale should be measured at the lower of
    its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, and thus,
    we have recorded impairments of assets held for sale of
    $47 million and $96 million during fiscal 2009 and
    2008, respectively. There were no impairments in fiscal 2007.

In fiscal 2009 and 2008, as part of our ongoing review of real
    estate holdings, we determined that certain properties were
    underutilized and committed to sell these properties. We expect
    the sale of the remaining properties to be completed no later
    than the third quarter of fiscal 2010.

In fiscal 2008, we determined that certain tangible and
    intangible assets and liabilities of the Storage and Server
    Management segment did not meet the long term strategic
    objectives of the segment. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we
    sold the tangible and intangible assets (and liabilities)
    classified as held for sale.

    $478 million in cash, including $6 million in
    acquisition-related expenses resulting from financial advisory,
    legal and accounting services, duplicate sites, and severance.
    No equity interests were issued. We recorded goodwill in
    connection with each of these acquisitions, which resulted
    primarily from our expectation of synergies from the integration
    of the acquired company’s technology with our technology
    and the acquired company’s access to our global
    distribution network. In addition, each acquired company
    provided a knowledgeable and experienced workforce. All of the
    goodwill from the nSuite Technologies, Inc. (“nSuite”)
    acquisition is tax deductible and most of the goodwill from the
    PC Tools Pty Ltd. (“PC Tools”) acquisition is tax
    deductible, while goodwill for the other acquisitions is not tax
    deductible. In addition, the purchase price for PC Tools is
    subject to a contingent consideration adjustment of up to an
    additional $30 million in cash if PC Tools achieves certain
    billings and expense targets. The results of operations for the

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we modified our
    operating segments to be better in line with how we manage our
    business.

Based on a combination of factors, including the current
    economic environment and a decline in our market capitalization,
    we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us
    to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis during the
    third quarter of fiscal 2009. The analysis was not completed
    during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and an estimated
    impairment charge of $7.0 billion was recorded. The
    analysis was subsequently finalized and an additional impairment
    charge of $413 million was included in our results for the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. As a result, we recorded a total
    non-cash goodwill impairment charge based on the interim
    impairment analysis of $7.4 billion for fiscal 2009. We
    also performed our annual impairment analysis during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2009 and determined that no additional
    impairment charge was required.



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we apply a fair value
    based impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis and on an
    interim basis, whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value of goodwill or indefinite-lived
    intangible assets may not be recoverable and an impairment loss
    may have been incurred.

When a potential impairment of goodwill is indicated, we
    determine the carrying value of the assets and liabilities
    related to identified reporting units, including an allocation
    of goodwill, and estimate the respective fair value of our
    reporting units. The specific analysis of a potential goodwill
    impairment then requires a two-step process. The first step of
    evaluating impairment involves determining if the estimated fair
    value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying value, in
    which case we then perform the second step of the goodwill
    impairment analysis. The second step requires estimating the
    fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the
    respective reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase
    price allocation for an acquired business. An impairment loss is
    then recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of
    the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair
    value.

As noted in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the
    calculation of potential goodwill impairment requires
    significant judgment at many points during the analysis. In
    determining the carrying value of the reporting units, we
    applied judgment to allocate assets and liabilities, such as
    accounts receivable and property, plant and equipment, based on
    the specific identification or relevant driver, as they are not
    held by those reporting units but by functional departments.
    Furthermore, for the reporting units with recognized goodwill
    for the purposes of our analysis, we utilize the income
    approach, under which we calculate fair value based on the
    estimated discounted future cash flows of that specific
    reporting unit. The income approach was determined to be the
    most representative valuation technique that would be utilized
    by a market participant in an assumed transaction, but we also
    consider the market approach which measures the value of an
    asset through an analysis of recent sales or offerings of
    comparable property. When applied to the valuation of equity
    interests, consideration is given to the financial condition and
    operating performance of the company being appraised relative to
    those of publicly traded companies operating in the same or
    similar lines of business, potentially subject to corresponding
    economic, environmental, and political factors and considered to
    be reasonable investment alternatives. We also consider our
    market capitalization on the date we perform our analysis as
    compared to the sum of the fair values of our reporting units to
    assess the reasonableness of the values of the reporting units
    determined under the income approach.

The income approach requires us to make estimates and judgments
    about the future cash flows of each reporting unit as well as
    discount rates to be applied. Although our cash flow forecasts
    are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and
    estimates we are using to manage the underlying reporting units,
    there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows
    attributable to these reporting units. As a result of the
    downturn in the economic environment during the second half of
    calendar 2008, determining the fair value of the individual
    reporting units is even more judgmental than in the past. In
    particular, the global economic recession has reduced our
    visibility into long-term trends, and consequently, estimates of
    future cash flows used in the current year analyses are lower
    than those used in the prior year analysis. The discount rates
    utilized in the analysis also reflect market-based estimates of
    the risks associated with the projected cash flows of individual
    reporting units and were increased from the prior year analysis
    to reflect increased risk due to current volatility in the
    economic environment.

Our reporting units are identified in accordance with
    SFAS No. 142 and are either equivalent to, or
    represent one level below, an operating segment, which
    constitute a business for which discrete financial information
    is available and for which segment management regularly reviews
    the operating results. Our operating segments are significant
    strategic business units that offer different products and
    services, distinguished by customer needs. Our reporting units
    are consistent with our operating segments, except for the
    Services segment, which includes the SaaS and the Services
    reporting units. The SaaS reporting unit is new for fiscal 2009
    and was primarily the result of an acquisition during the year.

Investment
    in Joint Venture

On February 5, 2008, Symantec formed Huawei-Symantec, Inc.
    (“joint venture”) with a subsidiary of Huawei
    Technologies Co., Ltd. (“Huawei”). The joint venture
    is domiciled in Hong Kong with principal operations in Chengdu,
    China. We contributed cash of $150 million, licenses
    related to certain intellectual property and intangible assets
    in exchange for 49% of the outstanding common shares of the
    joint venture. The joint venture will develop, manufacture,
    market and support security and storage appliances to global
    telecommunications carriers and enterprise customers. Huawei
    contributed its telecommunications storage and security business
    assets,



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

engineering, sales and marketing resources, personnel, and
    licenses related to intellectual property in exchange for a 51%
    ownership interest in the joint venture.

The contribution of assets to the joint venture was accounted
    for at its carrying value. The historical carrying value of the
    assets contributed by Symantec comprised a significant portion
    of the net assets of the joint venture. As a result, our
    carrying value of the investment in the joint venture exceeded
    our proportionate share in the book value of the joint venture
    by approximately $75 million upon formation of the joint
    venture. As the contributions for both Symantec and Huawei were
    recorded at historical carrying value by the joint venture, this
    basis difference is attributable to the contributed identified
    intangible assets. The basis difference is being amortized over
    a weighted-average period of 9 years, the estimated useful
    lives of the underlying identified intangible assets to which
    the basis difference is attributed.

On February 5, 2011, we have a one-time option to purchase
    an additional two percent ownership interest from Huawei for
    $28 million. We determined the value of the option using
    the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The value of the option
    is not considered material to the financial statements and is
    recorded in Investment in joint venture on the Balance Sheet. We
    have concluded that the option does not meet the definition of a
    derivative under SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.

Symantec and
    Huawei each have the right to purchase all of the other
    partner’s ownership interest through a bid process upon
    certain triggering events set to occur as early as
    February 5, 2011.

In fiscal 2009, we recorded a loss of approximately
    $53 million related to our share of the joint
    venture’s net loss, including the amortization of the basis
    difference described above, for the joint venture’s period
    ended December 31, 2008. The carrying value of our
    investment in the joint venture as of April 3, 2009 was
    approximately $97 million.

    joint venture and the calculation of our share of the joint
    venture’s loss are as follows:

Debt

Convertible
    senior notes

In June 2006, we issued $1.1 billion principal amount of
    0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15, 2011 (the
    “0.75% Notes”) and $1.0 billion principal
    amount of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due June 15,
    2013 (the “1.00% Notes”) to initial purchasers in
    a private offering for resale to qualified institutional buyers
    pursuant to SEC Rule 144A. We refer to the 0.75% Notes
    and the 1.00% Notes collectively as the Senior Notes. We
    received proceeds of $2.1 billion from the Senior Notes and
    incurred net transaction costs of approximately
    $33 million, which were allocated proportionately to the
    0.75% Notes and the 1.00% Notes. The 0.75% Notes
    and 1.00% Notes were each issued at par and bear interest
    at 0.75% and 1.00% per annum, respectively. Interest is payable
    semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15,
    beginning December 15, 2006.



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Each $1,000 of principal of the Senior Notes will initially be
    convertible into 52.2951 shares of Symantec common stock,
    which is the equivalent of $19.12 per share, subject to
    adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of
    the Senior Notes may convert their Senior Notes prior to
    maturity during specified periods as follows: (1) during
    any calendar quarter beginning after June 30, 2006, if the
    closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days
    in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
    day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than
    130% of the applicable conversion price per share; (2) if
    specified corporate transactions, including a change in control,
    occur; (3) with respect to the 0.75% Notes, at any
    time on or after April 5, 2011, and with respect to the
    1.00% Notes, at any time on or after April 5, 2013; or
    (4) during the five

business-day

period after any five consecutive

trading-day

period during which the trading price of the Senior Notes falls
    below a certain threshold. Upon conversion, we would pay the
    holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of
    Symantec common stock, up to the principal amount of the note.
    Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid
    in cash or in stock at our option. Holders who convert their
    Senior Notes in connection with a change in control may be
    entitled to a “make whole” premium in the form of an
    increase in the conversion rate. As of April 3, 2009, none
    of the conditions allowing holders of the Senior Notes to
    convert had been met. In addition, upon a change in control of
    Symantec, the holders of the Senior Notes may require us to
    repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Senior Notes for
    100% of the principal amount.

Concurrently with the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered
    into note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain of the
    initial purchasers whereby we have the option to purchase up to
    110 million shares of our common stock at a price of $19.12
    per share. The options as to 58 million shares expire on
    June 15, 2011 and the options as to 52 million shares
    expire on June 15, 2013. The options must be settled in net
    shares. The cost of the note hedge transactions to us was
    approximately $592 million. In addition, we sold warrants
    to affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers whereby they
    have the option to purchase up to 110 million shares of our
    common stock at a price of $27.3175 per share. The warrants
    expire on various dates from July 2011 through August 2013 and
    must be settled in net shares. We received approximately
    $326 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these
    warrants.

In accordance with SFAS No. 128, the Senior Notes will
    have no impact on diluted earnings per share (“EPS”)
    until the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price
    of $19.12 per share because the principal amount of the Senior
    Notes will be settled in cash upon conversion. Prior to
    conversion, we will include the effect of the additional shares
    that may be issued if our common stock price exceeds $19.12 per
    share using the treasury stock method. As a result, for the
    first $1.00 by which the average price of our common stock for a
    quarterly period exceeds $19.12 per share there would be
    dilution of approximately 5.4 million shares. As the share
    price continues to increase, additional dilution would occur at
    a declining rate such that an average price of $27.3175 per
    share would yield cumulative dilution of approximately
    32.9 million shares. If the average price of our common
    stock exceeds $27.3175 per share for a quarterly period we will
    also include the effect of the additional potential shares that
    may be issued related to the warrants using the treasury stock
    method. The Senior Notes along with the warrants have a combined
    dilutive effect such that for the first $1.00 by which the
    average price exceeds $27.3175 per share there would be
    cumulative dilution of approximately 39.5 million shares
    prior to conversion. As the share price continues to increase,
    additional dilution would occur but at a declining rate.

Prior to conversion, the note hedge transactions are not
    considered for purposes of the EPS calculation, as their effect
    would be anti-dilutive. Upon conversion, the note hedge will
    automatically serve to neutralize the dilutive effect of the
    Senior Notes when the stock price is above $19.12 per share. For
    example, if upon conversion the price of our common stock was
    $28.3175 per share, the cumulative effect of approximately
    39.5 million shares in the example above would be reduced
    to approximately 3.9 million shares.

The preceding calculations assume that the average price of our
    common stock exceeds the respective conversion prices during the
    period for which EPS is calculated and exclude any potential
    adjustments to the conversion ratio provided under the terms of
    the Senior Notes. See Note 15 for information regarding the
    impact on EPS of the Senior Notes and warrants in the current
    period.

Revolving
    credit facility

In July 2006, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior
    unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in July 2011.
    Borrowings under the facility bear interest, at our option, at
    either a rate equal to the bank’s base rate or a rate equal
    to LIBOR plus a margin based on our leverage ratio, as defined
    in the credit facility agreement. In connection with the credit
    facility, we must maintain certain covenants, including a
    specified ratio of debt to earnings (before interest, taxes,
    depreciation, amortization and impairments) as well as various
    other non-financial covenants.

On November 29, 2007, we borrowed $200 million under
    this credit agreement to partially finance our acquisition of
    Vontu with an interest rate of 4.7075% per annum due and payable
    quarterly. During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we repaid
    the entire line of credit principal amount of $200 million
    plus accrued interest of $3 million. Total interest expense
    associated with this borrowing was approximately
    $6 million. As of April 3, 2009, we were in compliance
    with all required covenants, and there was no outstanding
    balance on the credit facility.

Note 9.

Restructuring

Our restructuring costs consist of severance, benefits,
    facilities and other costs. Severance and benefits generally
    include severance, stay-put or one-time bonuses, outplacement
    services, health insurance coverage, effects of foreign currency
    exchange and legal costs. Facilities’ costs generally
    include rent expense, less expected sublease income and lease
    termination costs. Other costs generally include relocation,
    asset abandonment costs, the effects of foreign currency
    exchange and consulting services. Restructuring expenses
    generally do not impact a particular reporting segment and are
    included in the “Other” reporting segment.

Charges for severance, benefits and facilities were
    $75 million, $74 million, and $70 million for
    fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Charges for fiscal
    2009, 2008, and 2007 periods were primarily related to severance
    and benefits related to the worldwide headcount reduction
    actions in each year as well as the business structure changes
    in the 2008 Plan described below which occurred in fiscal 2009.

Additionally, we incurred $21 million in charges for
    transition and transformation fees, consulting charges and other
    costs related to the outsourcing of back office functions in
    fiscal 2009.. The transition and transformation related
    activities are expected to be substantially complete at the end
    of fiscal 2010. Total remaining costs for these activities are
    estimated to be $40 million.

    Restructuring Plan (“2009 Plan”)

In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, management approved and
    initiated the following restructuring events to:

•

Reduce operating costs through a worldwide headcount
    reduction.

Charges related to this action are for
    severance and benefits. These actions were initiated in the
    third quarter of fiscal 2009 and are expected to be
    substantially completed in fiscal 2010. Total remaining costs
    for relocation are not expected to be material.

•

Consolidate facilities.

In an ongoing effort
    to consolidate facilities, we decided to move our corporate
    headquarters to Mountain View, California. Charges related to
    this action will primarily be associated with moving costs.
    These actions have been initiated and costs are expected to be
    substantially completed in fiscal 2010 but are not expected to
    be material.

    Restructuring Plan (“2008 Plan”)

In the third quarter of fiscal 2008, management approved and
    initiated the following restructuring events to:

•

Reduce operating costs through a worldwide headcount
    reduction

.  This action was initiated in the third
    quarter of fiscal 2008 and was substantially completed in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Charges related to this action
    are for severance and benefits. Total remaining costs are not
    expected to be material.

    products.

Charges related to these actions are
    for severance and benefits. These actions were initiated in the
    third quarter of fiscal 2008 and are expected to be completed in
    fiscal 2010. Total remaining costs for the 2008 Plan are
    estimated to range from $15 million to $20 million.

•

Outsource certain back office functions
    worldwide.

Charges related to these actions are
    primarily for severance and benefits. These actions were
    initiated in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and are expected
    to be substantially completed in fiscal 2010. Total remaining
    costs for severance and benefits are expected to range from
    $10 million to $35 million.

Acquisition-Related
    Restructuring Plans

We review our real estate holdings on an ongoing basis. In this
    review, we assess underutilized space which has largely resulted
    from the integration efforts related to earlier business
    acquisitions. Restructuring liabilities consist of excess
    facilities obligations. These restructuring liabilities at
    April 3, 2009 primarily related to excess facility
    obligations at several locations around the world.
    Acquisition-related restructuring liabilities are expected to be
    paid between fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2016 when their respective
    lease terms end.

Indemnification

As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we
    indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or
    occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at
    our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of
    future payments we could be required to make under these
    indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have
    directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage that
    reduces our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of
    any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of
    these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable
    insurance coverage is minimal.

We provide limited product warranties and the majority of our
    software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify
    licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from
    claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual
    property rights of a third party. Historically, payments made
    under these provisions have been immaterial. We monitor the
    conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a
    loss has occurred.

Litigation
    Contingencies

For a discussion of our pending tax litigation with the Internal
    Revenue Service relating to the 2000 and 2001 tax years of
    Veritas, see Note 14.

On July 7, 2004, a purported class action complaint
    entitled Paul Kuck, et al. v. Veritas Software Corporation,
    et al. was filed in the United States District Court for the
    District of Delaware. The lawsuit alleges violations of federal
    securities laws in connection with Veritas’ announcement on
    July 6, 2004 that it expected results of

operations for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2004 to
    fall below earlier estimates. The complaint generally seeks an
    unspecified amount of damages. Subsequently, additional
    purported class action complaints have been filed in Delaware
    federal court, and, on March 3, 2005, the Court entered an
    order consolidating these actions and appointing lead plaintiffs
    and counsel. A consolidated amended complaint (“CAC”),
    was filed on May 27, 2005, expanding the class period from
    April 23, 2004 through July 6, 2004. The CAC also
    named another officer as a defendant and added allegations that
    Veritas and the named officers made false or misleading
    statements in press releases and SEC filings regarding the
    company’s financial results, which allegedly contained
    revenue recognized from contracts that were unsigned or lacked
    essential terms. The defendants to this matter filed a motion to
    dismiss the CAC in July 2005; the motion was denied in May 2006.
    In April 2008, the parties filed a stipulation of settlement. On
    July 31, 2008, the Court held a final approval hearing and,
    on August 5, 2008, the Court entered an order approving the
    settlement. An objector to the fees portion of the settlement
    has lodged an appeal. In fiscal 2008, we recorded an accrual in
    the amount of $21.5 million for this matter and, pursuant
    to the terms of the settlement, we established a settlement fund
    of $21.5 million on May 1, 2008.

We are also involved in a number of other judicial and
    administrative proceedings that are incidental to our business.
    Although adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur in one or
    more of the cases, it is not possible to estimate the possible
    loss or losses from each of these cases. The final resolution of
    these lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, is not
    expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition or results of operations.

Segment
    Information

During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we changed our
    operating segments to better align our operating structure.
    Altiris services that were formerly included in the Security and
    Compliance segment were moved to the Services segment. This move
    is a result of operational changes in our Services segment and
    the continued integration of our Altiris business. All operating
    segments are managed by the chief operating decision maker,
    which is our current chief executive officer, formerly our chief
    operating officer. Our chief operating decision maker, manages
    business operations, evaluates performance and allocates
    resources based primarily on the operating segments’ net
    revenues. The new business structure more directly aligns the
    operating segments with markets and customers, and we believe
    will establish more direct lines of reporting responsibilities,
    speed decision making, and enhance the ability to pursue
    strategic growth opportunities. We revised the business segment

information for prior years to conform to the new presentation.
    Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments.
    As of April 3, 2009, we operated in five operating segments:

•

Consumer.

Our Consumer segment focuses on
    delivering our Internet security, PC tuneup, and backup products
    to individual users and home offices.

•

Security and Compliance.

Our Security and
    Compliance segment focuses on providing large, medium, and
    small-sized businesses with solutions for endpoint security and
    management, compliance, archiving, messaging management, and
    data loss prevention solutions that allow our customers to
    secure, provision, and remotely access their laptops, PCs,
    mobile devices, and servers.

•

Storage and Server Management.

Our Storage and
    Server Management segment focuses on providing enterprise and
    large enterprise customers with storage and server management,
    backup, and data protection solutions across heterogeneous
    storage and server platforms.

•

Services.

Our Services segment provides
    customers with leading IT risk management services and solutions
    to manage security, availability, performance and compliance
    risks across multi-vendor environments. Our services include
    consulting, business critical, education, SaaS and managed
    security services.

•

Other.

Our Other segment is comprised of
    sunset products and products nearing the end of their life
    cycle. It also includes general and administrative expenses;
    amortization of acquired product rights, intangible assets, and
    other assets; goodwill impairment charges; charges such as
    stock-based compensation and restructuring; and certain indirect
    costs that are not charged to the other operating segments.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
    described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
    There are no intersegment sales. Our chief operating decision
    maker evaluates performance primarily based on net revenue.
    Except for goodwill, as disclosed in Note 6, the majority
    of our assets are not discretely identified by segment. The
    depreciation and amortization of our property, equipment, and
    leasehold improvements are allocated based on headcount, unless
    specifically identified by segment.

In fiscal 2009, we revised an allocation of sales and marketing
    expense between the Security and Compliance segment and Storage
    and Server Management segment as a result of a misclassification
    which has been revised for all periods presented. The result of
    this reclassification increased the operating income of the
    Security and Compliance segment and decreased the operating
    income of the Storage and Server Management segment by
    $201 million in fiscal 2008 and $146 million in fiscal
    2007.

    of several non-exclusive, independently negotiated agreements
    with its subsidiaries, each of which cover different countries
    or regions. Each of these agreements is separately negotiated
    and is independent of any other contract (such as a master

Employee
    Benefits and Stock-Based Compensation

401(k)
    plan

We maintain a salary deferral 401(k) plan for all of our
    domestic employees. This plan allows employees to contribute up
    to 50% of their pretax salary up to the maximum dollar
    limitation prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. We match 50%
    of the employee’s contribution. The maximum match in any
    given plan year is 3% of the employees’ eligible
    compensation, up to $6,000. Our contributions under the plan
    were $20 million, $24 million, and $24 million,
    in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Stock
    purchase plans

    Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In September 1998, our stockholders approved the 1998 Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (“1998 ESPP”), and reserved shares
    of common stock for issuance thereunder. Under the 1998 ESPP,
    4 million, 5 million, and 4 million shares were
    issued during fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively,
    representing $63 million, $69 million, and
    $65 million in contributions, respectively. The 1998 ESPP
    expired in fiscal 2009. As of April 3, 2009 a total of
    33 million shares had been issued and no shares remain
    available for issuance under this plan.

    Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In September 2008, our stockholders approved the 2008 Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (“2008 ESPP”) and reserved
    20 million shares of common stock for issuance thereunder.
    As of April 3, 2009, 20 million shares remain
    available for issuance under the 2008 ESPP.

Subject to certain limitations, our employees may elect to have
    2% to 10% of their compensation withheld through payroll
    deductions to purchase shares of common stock under the 2008
    ESPP. Employees purchase shares of common stock at a price per
    share equal to 85% of the fair market value on the purchase date
    at the end of each six-month purchase period.

    Executive Officers’ Stock Purchase Plan

In September 2002, our stockholders approved the 2002 Executive
    Officers’ Stock Purchase Plan and reserved
    250,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder,
    which was amended by our Board of Directors in January 2008. The
    purpose of the plan is to provide executive officers with a
    means to acquire an equity interest in Symantec at fair market
    value by applying a portion or all of their respective bonus
    payments towards the purchase price. As of April 3, 2009,
    40,401 shares have been issued under the plan and
    209,599 shares remain available for future issuance. Shares
    reserved for issuance under this plan have not been adjusted for
    the stock dividends.

Stock
    award plans

2000 Director
    Equity Incentive Plan

In September 2000, our stockholders approved the
    2000 Director Equity Incentive Plan and reserved
    50,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder.
    Stockholders increased the number of shares of stock that may be
    issued by 50,000 in both September 2004 and September 2007. The
    purpose of this plan is to provide the members of the Board of
    Directors with an opportunity to receive common stock for all or
    a portion of the retainer payable to each director for serving
    as a member. Each director may elect any portion up to 100% of
    the retainer to be paid in the form of stock. As of
    April 3, 2009, a total of 40,119 shares had been
    issued under this plan and 109,881 shares remained
    available for future issuance.

    Equity Incentive Plan

Under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, (“2004 Plan”)
    our Board of Directors, or a committee of the Board of
    Directors, may grant incentive and nonqualified stock options,
    stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units
    (“RSUs”), or restricted stock awards
    (“RSAs”) to employees, officers, directors,
    consultants, independent contractors, and advisors to us, or to
    any parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of ours. The purpose of the
    2004 Plan is to attract, retain, and motivate eligible persons
    whose present and potential contributions are important to our
    success by offering them an opportunity to participate in our
    future performance through equity awards of stock options and
    stock bonuses. Under the terms of the 2004 Plan, the exercise
    price of stock options may not be less than 100% of the fair
    market value on the date of grant. Options generally vest over a
    four-year period. Options granted prior to October 2005
    generally have a maximum term of ten years and options granted
    thereafter generally have a maximum term of seven years.

As of April 3, 2009, we have reserved 131 million
    shares for issuance under the 2004 Plan. These shares include
    18 million shares originally reserved for issuance under
    the 2004 Plan upon its adoption by our stockholders in September
    2004, 23 million shares that were transferred to the 2004
    Plan from the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan, (“1996
    Plan”), 40 million and 50 million shares that
    were approved for issuance on the amendment and restatement of
    the 2004 Plan at our 2006 and 2008 annual meeting of
    stockholders, respectively. In addition to the shares currently
    reserved under the 2004 Plan, any shares reacquired by us from
    options outstanding under the 1996 Plan upon their cancellation
    will also be added to the 2004 Plan reserve. As of April 3,
    2009, 77 million shares remain available for future grant
    under the 2004 Plan.

Assumed
    Vontu stock options

In connection with our acquisition of Vontu, we assumed all
    unexercised, outstanding options to purchase Vontu common stock.
    Each unexercised, outstanding option assumed was converted into
    an option to purchase Symantec common stock after applying the
    exchange ratio of 0.5351 shares of Symantec common stock
    for each share of Vontu common stock. In total, all unexercised,
    outstanding Vontu options were converted into options to
    purchase approximately 2.2 million shares of Symantec
    common stock. As of April 3, 2009, total unrecognized
    compensation cost adjusted for estimated forfeitures related to
    unexercised, outstanding Vontu stock options was approximately
    $4 million.

Furthermore, all shares obtained upon exercise of unvested Vontu
    options were converted into the right to receive cash of $9.33
    per share upon vesting. The total value of the assumed
    exercised, unvested Vontu options on the date of acquisition was
    approximately $7 million, assuming no options are forfeited
    prior to vesting. As of April 3, 2009, total unrecognized
    compensation cost adjusted for estimated forfeitures related to
    exercised, unvested Vontu stock options was approximately
    $1 million.

The assumed options retained all applicable terms and vesting
    periods, except for certain options that were accelerated
    according to a change in control provision and will generally
    vest within a twelve month period from the date of acquisition
    and certain other options that vested in full as of the
    acquisition date. In general, the assumed options typically vest
    over a period of four years from the original date of grant of
    the option and have a maximum term of ten years.

Assumed
    Altiris stock options and awards

In connection with our acquisition of Altiris, we assumed all of
    the outstanding options to purchase Altiris common stock. Each
    option assumed was converted into an option to purchase Symantec
    common stock after applying the exchange ratio of
    1.9075 shares of Symantec common stock for each share of
    Altiris common stock. In total, we assumed and converted Altiris
    options into options to purchase approximately 3 million
    shares of Symantec common stock. In addition, we assumed and
    converted all outstanding Altiris RSUs into approximately
    320,000 Symantec RSUs, based on the same exchange ratio.
    Furthermore, we assumed all outstanding Altiris RSAs



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

which were converted into the right to receive cash in the
    amount of $33.00 per share upon vesting. The total value of the
    assumed Altiris RSAs on the date of acquisition was
    approximately $9 million, assuming no Altiris RSAs are
    forfeited prior to vesting, and all Altiris RSAs have vested and
    been paid. As of April 3, 2009, the total unrecognized
    compensation cost adjusted for estimated forfeitures, related to
    the Altiris unvested stock options and RSUs, was immaterial.

The assumed Altiris options, RSUs, and RSAs retained all
    applicable terms and vesting periods, except for certain Altiris
    options, RSAs and RSUs that were accelerated according to the
    executive vesting plan and were vested over a four to twelve
    month period from the date of acquisition and certain other
    options that vested in full as of the acquisition date. In
    general, the assumed Altiris options vest over a period of three
    to four years from the original date of grant and have a maximum
    term of ten years. The assumed Altiris RSUs and RSAs typically
    vest over a period of two to three years from the original date
    of grant.

Other
    stock option plans

Options remain outstanding under several other stock option
    plans, including the 2001 Non-Qualified Equity Incentive Plan,
    the 1999 Acquisition Plan, the 1996 Plan, and various plans
    assumed in connection with acquisitions. No further options may
    be granted under any of these plans.

Valuation
    of stock-based awards

The fair value of each stock option granted under our equity
    incentive plans is estimated on the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
    weighted-average assumptions:

Changes in the Black-Scholes valuation assumptions and our
    estimated forfeiture rate may change the estimate of fair value
    for stock-based compensation and the related expense recognized.
    There have not been any material changes to our stock-based
    compensation expense due to changes in our valuation assumptions
    of stock-based awards.

The net effect of a forfeiture rate adjustment in the third
    quarter based upon actual results was a decrease to our
    stock-based compensation expense for the twelve months ended
    April 3, 2009 by approximately $13 million.

As of April 3, 2009, total unrecognized compensation cost
    adjusted for estimated forfeitures related to unvested stock
    options, and RSUs was $79 million and $77 million,
    respectively, which is expected to be recognized over the
    remaining weighted-average vesting periods of 2 years for
    stock options and 2 years for RSUs.

Of the $101 million total valuation allowance provided
    against our deferred tax assets, approximately $89 million
    is attributable to acquisition-related assets. When
    SFAS No. 141(R) becomes effective in the first quarter
    of our fiscal year 2010, the benefits attributable to our
    valuation allowance will reduce income tax expense when and if
    realized. The valuation allowance increased by $63 million
    in fiscal 2009, $56 million was attributable to certain
    Irish deferred tax assets that will require an extended period
    of time to realize, $6 million was attributable to capital
    losses, and $1 million was attributable to
    acquisition-related assets.

As of April 3, 2009, we have U.S. federal net
    operating loss and credit carryforwards attributable to various
    acquired companies of approximately $186 million and
    $5 million, respectively, which, if not used, will expire
    between fiscal 2010 and 2029. These net operating loss
    carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Internal
    Revenue Code § 382, but are expected to be fully
    realized. Furthermore, we have U.S. state net operating
    loss and credit carryforwards attributable to various acquired
    companies of approximately $250 million and
    $12 million, respectively, which will expire in various
    fiscal years. In addition, we have foreign net operating loss
    carryforwards attributable to various acquired foreign companies
    of approximately $349 million net of valuation allowances,
    which, under current applicable foreign tax law, can be carried
    forward indefinitely.

As a result of the impairment of goodwill, we have cumulative
    pre-tax book losses, as measured by the current and prior two
    years. We considered the negative evidence of this cumulative
    pre-tax book loss position on our ability to continue to
    recognize deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future
    taxable income for realization. We considered the following as
    positive evidence: the vast majority of the goodwill impairment
    is not deductible for tax purposes and thus will not result in
    tax losses; we have a strong, consistent taxpaying history; we
    have substantial U.S. federal income tax carryback
    potential; and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future
    reversals of



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities.
    We have concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the
    negative evidence and, thus, that the deferred tax assets as of
    April 3, 2009 of $702 million, after application of
    the valuation allowances, are realizable on a “more likely
    than not” basis.

As of April 3, 2009, no provision has been made for federal
    or state income taxes on $1.5 billion of cumulative
    unremitted earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries,
    since we plan to indefinitely reinvest these earnings. As of
    April 3, 2009, the unrecognized deferred tax liability for
    these earnings was $447 million.

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB FIN 48,
    effective March 31, 2007. The cumulative effect of adopting
    FIN 48 was a decrease in tax reserves of $16 million,
    resulting in a decrease to Veritas goodwill of $10 million,
    an increase of $5 million to the March 31, 2007
    Accumulated earnings balance, and a $1 million increase in
    Additional paid-in capital. Upon adoption, the gross liability
    for unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2007 was
    $456 million, exclusive of interest and penalties.

The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax
    benefits since adoption were as follows (in thousands):

Of the $45 million of changes in gross unrecognized tax
    benefits during the year disclosed above, approximately
    $22 million was provided through purchase accounting in
    connection with acquisitions made in fiscal 2009. This gross
    liability is reduced by offsetting tax benefits associated with
    the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing
    adjustments, interest deductions, and state income taxes, as
    well as payments made to date.

Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at April 3, 2009,
    $632 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the
    Company’s effective tax rate, while $2 million would
    affect the cumulative translation adjustments. However, one or
    more of these unrecognized tax benefits could be subject to a
    valuation allowance if and when recognized in a future period,
    which could impact the timing of any related effective tax rate
    benefit.

Our policy to include interest and penalties related to gross
    unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes
    did not change upon the adoption of FIN 48. At
    April 3, 2009, before any tax benefits, we had
    $136 million of accrued interest and accrued penalties on
    unrecognized tax benefits. Interest included in our provision
    for income taxes was a benefit of approximately $2 million
    for the year ended April 3, 2009. If the accrued interest
    and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued
    will be reduced in the period that such determination is made,
    and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. on a federal basis
    and in many U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two
    most significant tax jurisdictions are the U.S. and
    Ireland. Our tax filings remain subject to examination by



SYMANTEC
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time
    following the tax year to which those filings relate. Our 2000
    through 2008 tax years remain subject to examination by the
    Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for U.S. federal
    tax purposes, and our 2004 through 2008 tax years remain subject
    to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for
    Irish tax purposes. Other significant jurisdictions include
    California, Japan, and India. As of April 3, 2009, we are
    under examination by the IRS, for the Veritas U.S. federal
    income taxes for the 2002 through 2005 tax years. In addition,
    we are under examination by the California Franchise Tax Board
    for the Symantec California income taxes for the 2004 through
    2005 tax years. We are also under audit by the Japanese and
    Indian income tax authorities for fiscal years 2004 through
    2008, and 2004 through 2005, respectively.

We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing income tax
    controversies and the impact, if any, of the expected tolling of
    the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.
    Considering these facts, we do not currently believe there is a
    reasonable possibility of any significant change to our total
    unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.

On March 29, 2006, we received a Notice of Deficiency from
    the IRS claiming that we owe $867 million of additional
    taxes, excluding interest and penalties, for the 2000 and 2001
    tax years based on an audit of Veritas. On June 26, 2006,
    we filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court protesting the
    IRS claim for such additional taxes. In the March 2007 quarter,
    we agreed to pay $7 million out of $35 million
    originally assessed by the IRS in connection with several of the
    lesser issues covered in the assessment. The IRS agreed to waive
    the assessment of penalties. During July 2008, we completed the
    trial phase of the Tax Court case, which dealt with the
    remaining issue covered in the assessment. At trial, the IRS
    changed its position with respect to this remaining issue, which
    decreased the remaining amount at issue from $832 million
    to $545 million, excluding interest. We filed our
    post-trial briefs in October 2008 and rebuttal briefs in
    November 2008 with the U.S. Tax Court.

We strongly believe the IRS’ position with regard to this
    matter is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and existing
    Treasury regulations, and that our previously reported income
    tax provision for the years in question is appropriate. If, upon
    resolution, the final assessment differs from our tax provision,
    the adjustment including interest, would be accounted for
    through income tax expense in the period the matter is resolved,
    when SFAS 141(R) becomes effective in the first quarter of
    fiscal year 2010.

On September 5, 2006, we executed a closing agreement with
    the IRS with respect to the audit of Symantec’s fiscal 2003
    and 2004 federal income tax returns. The closing agreement
    represents the final assessment by the IRS of additional tax for
    these fiscal years of approximately $35 million, including
    interest. Based on the final settlement, a tax benefit of
    $8 million is reflected in the September 2006 quarter.

In July 2008, we reached an agreement with the IRS concerning
    our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made
    from a Veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the July 2005
    acquisition. The distribution was intended to be made pursuant
    to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and therefore
    eligible for a 5.25% effective U.S. federal rate of tax, in
    lieu of the 35% statutory rate. The final impact of this
    agreement is not yet known since this relates to the taxability
    of earnings that are otherwise the subject of the tax years

2000-2001

transfer pricing dispute which in turn is being addressed in the
    U.S. Tax Court. To the extent that we owe taxes as a result
    of the transfer pricing dispute, we anticipate that the
    incremental tax due from this negotiated agreement will
    decrease. We currently estimate that the most probable outcome
    from this negotiated agreement will be $13 million or less,
    for which an accrual has already been made. We made a payment of
    $130 million to the IRS for this matter in May 2006. We
    applied $110 million of this payment as a deposit on the
    outstanding transfer pricing matter for the tax years

2000-2001.

The accounting treatment related to pre-acquisition unrecognized
    tax benefits will change when FAS 141(R) becomes effective,
    which will be in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2010. At
    such time, any changes to the recognition or measurement of
    unrecognized tax benefits related to pre-acquisition periods
    will be recorded through income tax expense, while for fiscal
    2009 and earlier the accounting treatment would require any
    adjustment to be recognized through the purchase price as an
    increase or decrease to goodwill.

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed on the basis
    of the weighted average number of shares of common stock
    outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share also
    includes the incremental effect of dilutive potential common
    shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock
    method. Dilutive potential common shares include shares
    underlying outstanding stock options, stock awards, warrants,
