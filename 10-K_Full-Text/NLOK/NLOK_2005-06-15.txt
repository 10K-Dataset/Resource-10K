Business Overview

We currently view our business in five operating segments:
Consumer Products, Enterprise Security, Enterprise
Administration, Services, and Other. For financial information
related to our operating segments, see Note 15 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Consumer Products

Our Consumer Products segment focuses on delivering our Internet
security and problem-solving products to individual users, home
offices, and small businesses. Symantec’s Norton brand of
consumer security products is a market leader in desktop
protection, with integrated products that work seamlessly to
protect customers’ computers from virus outbreaks or
malicious hacker attacks. Most of the products that we are
currently marketing or developing feature

including virus definitions, firewall rules, Uniform Resource
Locator , or URL, databases, and uninstall scripts. Retail
customers typically get a 12-month subscription to these
security updates with the purchase of any consumer product. Our
consumer products run primarily on Windows® and
Macintosh® operating systems. Our Consumer Products segment
represented 51%, 47%, and 41% of net revenues during fiscal
2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Product offerings in the
Consumer Products segment include Norton

Security Solutions by adding software for application service
providers, Internet service providers, or ISPs, portals, and
enterprises as well as antispam routers, which are available in
three deployment options, including server software,
pre-configured appliances, and a hosted solution. Providing a
comprehensive, multi-layered approach to combating unwanted
email known as spam, our Mail Security solutions include
technology that leverages more than 20 spam protection
techniques, delivering antispam effectiveness rates of up to 95%
and one of the industry’s highest accuracy rates against
false positives (legitimate email being categorized as spam).
Symantec’s global Brightmail Logistics and Operations
Centers, or BLOCs, analyze spam across the globe and provide
secure automatic spam filter updates every 10 minutes to help
thwart attacks. The

with customized and comprehensive notifications of
vulnerabilities and new potential threats worldwide, and with
countermeasures to prevent attacks before they occur, enabling
them to mitigate risk and manage threats. Symantec analysts
monitor potential threats 24 hours a day 7 days a week
across more than 18,000 distinct product versions using
information from more than 150 authoritative sources. They
continuously correlate attack data from the security systems of
more than 20,000 partners in 180 countries plus virus statistics
from the Symantec Digital Immune System and many other human
intelligence resources. These solutions are supported by

Management

At the gateway and server levels, our policy compliance
management solutions help customers define, manage, and enforce
policies from a central location as well as probe for network
vulnerabilities and suggest remedies to proactively reduce
business risk. The initial step to reduce corporate risk is to
effectively measure compliance with a business’s security
policy and detect vulnerabilities where critical information
resides.

Symantec security management products provide a comprehensive
solution allowing for the consolidation of security events, the
containment of security threats, and the centralization of
security policy enforcement. These products are built on an
open, interoperable framework that enables us to work together

efficiently manage their IT infrastructures. Our solutions are
used to optimize the security and availability of our
customers’ information, while reducing operational costs,
increasing IT quality of service, reducing complexity, and
enhancing our customers’ ability to rapidly respond to
constant business and technological change. This is typically
accomplished by transforming existing manual IT processes into
automated and unattended operations that can be performed on
multiple systems simultaneously across the enterprise, in a
dynamic and adaptive manner.

Our solutions allow customers to manage virtually any function
at any point in the lifecycle of their computing systems and
devices, from network auto-discovery and IT asset management, to
operating system provisioning and application deployment,
ongoing security updates and configuration management, rapid

Other

Our Other segment is comprised of sunset products and products
nearing the end of their life cycle.

Sales, Marketing, and Customers

We sell our consumer products to individuals and small
offices/home offices around the world through a multi-tiered
distribution network. Our products are available to customers
through channels that include distributors, retailers, direct
marketers, Internet-based resellers, original equipment
manufacturers, or OEMs, educational institutions, and ISPs. We
separately sell annual content update subscriptions directly to
end users primarily via the Internet. We also sell some of our
products and product upgrades through direct mail/email and over
the Internet, in conjunction with channel partners.

We sell our enterprise products and services to medium and large
corporate customers around the world through our direct sales
force, corporate resellers, value-added resellers, and system
integrators. In addition, our indirect sales force works closely
with our major distributor and reseller accounts to coordinate
the flow of orders, inventory levels, and sales to customers.

We maintain distribution relationships with major independent
distributors. We also work closely with retailers to execute
channel marketing promotions and other cooperative marketing
activities.

Our agreements with distributors and resellers are generally
nonexclusive and may be terminated by either party at any time
without cause. These distributors are not within our control and
are not obligated to purchase products from us. They also
distribute other vendors’ product lines.

In fiscal 2005, one reseller, Digital River, Inc., and two
distributors, Ingram Micro, Inc. and Tech Data Product
Management, Inc., including their subsidiaries, each accounted
for more than 10% of our total net revenues. In fiscal 2004 and
2003, two distributors, Ingram Micro, Inc. and Tech Data Product
Management, Inc., including their subsidiaries, each accounted
for more than 10% of our total net revenues.

Our marketing activities include:

For our consumer products, we typically offer two types of
rebate programs within most countries: volume incentive rebates
to channel partners and promotional rebates to distributors and
end-users. The distributor or reseller earns a volume incentive
rebate primarily based upon their sale of products to end-users.
We also offer rebates to individual users of various products
acquired through major retailers. We regularly offer upgrade



rebates to existing customers purchasing a new version of a
product. Both volume incentive rebates and end-user rebates are
accrued as an offset to revenue when revenue is originally
recorded.

International Sales

Revenues from sales outside of the United States represented 52%
of our net revenues during each of fiscal 2005 and 2004, and
represented 49% of our net revenues during fiscal 2003. Of these
revenues, sales in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa, or EMEA,
region represented 33% of our net revenues during each of fiscal
2005 and 2004, and represented 30% of our net revenues during
fiscal 2003. Additional financial information regarding our
international sales is provided in Note 15 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

We sell our products through authorized distributors, which may
be restricted to specified territories. For most of our consumer
products, we translate the documentation, software, and
packaging into the local language and prepare marketing programs
for each local market. We have marketing offices in Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary,
India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia,
Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and
the United Kingdom. These local offices facilitate our marketing
and distribution in international markets. Our international
operations are subject to various risks common to international
operations, including but not restricted to:

Symantec Security Response

Symantec Security Response is a team of dedicated intrusion
experts, security engineers, virus hunters, and global technical
support teams that work in tandem to provide extensive coverage
for enterprises and consumers. Symantec Security Response
provides customers with comprehensive, global, 24 hours a

security risks. The Symantec Internet Security Threat Report is
one of the most comprehensive sources of Internet threat data in
the world leveraging unparalleled sources to identify emerging
trends in attacks and malicious code activity including:



•

Symantec

tm

Probe Network, a system of more than 2 million decoy
    accounts attracting email messages from 20 different countries
    that allows Symantec to gauge spam and phishing activity

Research Centers

The research centers for Symantec Security Response are focused
on collecting and analyzing the latest malware threats, from
network security threats and vulnerabilities to viruses and
worms. When a new threat or vulnerability is discovered,
Symantec Security Response experts provide rapid emergency
response, focusing on communication with customers and delivery
of security updates for our security products. Research centers
are located around the world, including the United States, Asia
Pacific, and Europe. To ensure that customers are utilizing the
most recent technologies available for addressing security
issues, Symantec Security Response experts leverage our
sophisticated back-end product architecture. This architecture
allows users to receive the latest security updates —
including intrusion detection signatures and virus
definitions — automatically in the event of a new
security threat or outbreak. LiveUpdate technology simplifies
and speeds the process of receiving and implementing security
updates for our security product offerings at the server,
gateway, and desktop levels.

Technical Support

With more than 300 experts in Internet security, desktop
computer systems, and network management, our global technical
support team is available around the clock. Our technical
support experts provide customers with information on product
implementation and usage, as well as countermeasures and
identification tools for new threats.

We maintain centralized support facilities throughout the world
to drive rapid response to complex queries. Support is available
in multiple languages, including Dutch, English, French, German,
Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese, and Spanish.

Enterprise Security Support

Our enterprise security support program offers annual support
contracts to enterprise customers worldwide, including content,
upgrades, and technical support. Our standard technical support
includes 1) unlimited hot-line service delivered by
telephone, fax, email, and over the Internet; 2) immediate
patches for severe problems; 3) periodic software updates;
4) access to our technical knowledge base and frequently
asked question, or FAQ, facility; and 5) an invitation to
the annual user group meeting. Customers may augment their
standard annual support contract with services such as
24 hours a day 7 days a week telephone and web
support, advanced alerting services, additional designated
callers, or contacts, and additional language support, as well
as a Technical Account Manager assigned to work closely
with an organization and act as a focal point for all issues.

Consumer Product Support

Our consumer product support program provides free self-help
online services to all consumer customers worldwide, as well as
free email support. A team of product experts, editors, and
language translators are dedicated to maintaining the robustness
of the online knowledge base. Generally, telephone product
support is provided for a fee by an outside vendor. For
customers that subscribe to them, the latest virus definitions
and application bug fixes and/or patches for most of our
currently marketed and developed products are downloaded
automatically through LiveUpdate, created by Symantec Security
Response.

We revise these fee-based support programs from time to time as
customer requirements change and as market trends dictate. These
programs may vary slightly by region.



Recent Acquisitions and Divestitures

Acquisitions

Since our initial public offering on June 23, 1989, we have
completed acquisitions of 38 businesses. Our recent acquisitions
included:

We accounted for each of these acquisitions as a business
purchase and, accordingly, we have included the operating
results of these businesses in our consolidated financial
statements from their respective dates of acquisition. See
Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for further discussion of the above acquisitions. We also have
acquired several other businesses in the past, including Peter
Norton Computing, Inc. on August 31, 1990. We continue to
use the Norton brand name for certain consumer products
developed and marketed by us.

In April 2003, we purchased certain assets related to Roxio
Inc.’s
GoBack

tm

computer recovery software business. In addition, in August
2003, we purchased a security technology patent as part of a
legal settlement in

Hilgraeve, Inc. v. Symantec
Corporation.

On December 16, 2004, we announced a definitive agreement
with VERITAS Software Corporation, or VERITAS, a leading
independent supplier of storage and infrastructure software
products and services. Under this agreement, we would acquire
all of the outstanding stock of VERITAS in exchange for
1.1242 shares of Symantec common stock for each outstanding
share of VERITAS common stock. In addition, we would assume all
outstanding VERITAS stock options with an exercise price less
than or equal to $49.00 per share, as well as each
outstanding option that was granted under certain specified
VERITAS option plans, as adjusted in accordance with the
exchange ratio. All other outstanding VERITAS stock options
would be cancelled. The estimated purchase price is
$13 billion, which includes the estimated fair value of
Symantec common stock to be issued and VERITAS options to be
assumed, as well as estimated direct transaction costs. We
derived this estimate using an average market price per share of
Symantec common stock of $25.87, which was based on an average
of the closing prices for a range of trading days
(December 14, 2004 through December 20, 2004,
inclusive) around the announcement date (December 16, 2004)
of the proposed transaction. The final purchase price would be
determined based upon the number of VERITAS shares and options
outstanding at the closing date. Completion of the transaction
is subject to customary closing conditions that include, among
others, receipt of required approvals from Symantec and VERITAS
stockholders. Under terms specified in the merger agreement,
Symantec or VERITAS may terminate the agreement and as a result
either Symantec or VERITAS may be required to pay a
$440 million termination fee to the other party in certain
circumstances. While we currently anticipate that we will be in
a position to complete the merger on or prior to June 30,
2005, we believe that there may be administrative benefits to
completing the merger at the beginning of our second quarter of
fiscal 2006. Symantec and VERITAS have therefore discussed the
possibility of closing the merger during the first week of that
fiscal quarter. Unless otherwise indicated, the discussions in
this document relate to Symantec as a stand-alone entity and do
not reflect the impact of the pending business combination
transaction with VERITAS.

For further discussion of our recent acquisitions, see
Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Divestitures

In August 2001, we sold assets and transferred liabilities and
employees related to our Web Access Management product line to
PassGo Technologies, Ltd. and agreed to license them the related
technology for a period of four years through August 2005.

Product Development, Partnerships, Investments and
Acquisitions

We use a multiple product sourcing strategy that includes:

We develop software products that are designed to operate on a
variety of operating systems. We typically develop new products
and enhancements of existing products through focused product
development groups. Each product development group is
responsible for its own design, development, documentation, and
quality assurance. Our research and development expenditures for
each of the last three years are further discussed under
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Research and
Development Expenses.”

Independent contractors are used for aspects of the product
development process. In addition, elements of some of our
products are licensed from third parties.

We invest in companies with emerging technologies and companies
that promote the sale and use of our products and services.
These investments are made in lieu of an acquisition when timing
is inappropriate or when the business models and sectors fall
outside of our strategic requirements. We pursue investments
that we believe will be complementary and can enhance both
financial returns and market growth.

We use strategic acquisitions as necessary to provide certain
technology, people, and products for our overall product and
services strategy. We consider both time to market and potential
market share growth when evaluating acquisitions of
technologies, product lines, or companies. We have completed a
number of acquisitions of technologies, companies, and products
in the past, and we have also disposed of technologies and
products. We may acquire and/or dispose of other technologies,
companies and products in the future. For further discussion of
our acquisitions, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Competition

Our markets are competitive and are subject to rapid changes in
technology. They are influenced by the constant change in
Internet security threats and the strategic direction of major
software and operating system providers, network equipment and
computer hardware manufacturers, ISPs, application service
providers, and key application software vendors. Our
competitiveness depends on our ability to deliver products that
meet our customers’ needs by enhancing our existing
solutions and services and offering reliable, scalable, and
standardized new solutions on a timely basis. We have limited
resources, and as a result, we must deploy our available
resources thoughtfully. The principal competitive factors in our
Consumer Products, Enterprise Security, and Enterprise
Administration segments are quality, integration of advanced
technology, time to market, price, reputation, financial
stability, breadth of product offerings, customer support, brand
recognition, and sales and marketing teams. In our Services
segment, the principal competitive factors include technical
capability, customer responsiveness, price, ability to attract
and retain talented and experienced personnel, financial
stability and reputation within the industry.

In the enterprise security and administration markets, we
compete against many companies who offer competing products to
our technology solutions and competing services to our response
and support. In the area of antivirus and filtering products,
some of the companies we compete against are Computer
Associates, McAfee (formerly Network Associates), Sophos, Trend
Micro, and WebSense. In addition, Microsoft has recently



announced and has launched the internal testing of an online
suite that includes automated protection, maintenance, and
performance tuning. This consumer subscription service, Windows
OneCare, is expected to be a fee-based service available to the
general public by the end of calendar 2005. Microsoft has also
recently introduced a free antispyware product for the consumer
market. In the area of firewall and VPN, some of the companies
we compete against are Check Point Software, Cisco, Juniper,
SonicWALL, and WatchGuard. In the area of intrusion detection
and security management, some of the companies we compete
against are Bindview, Internet Security Systems, NetIQ, and
Tipping Point (recently acquired by 3Com). In the areas of
remote management, imaging provisioning, backup, recovery, and
asset management, some of the companies we compete against are
Altiris, Laplink, Marimba (recently acquired by BMC Software),
and VERITAS.

In addition, we face indirect or potential competition from
operating system providers and network equipment and computer
hardware manufacturers, who provide or may provide various
security solutions and functions in their current and future
products. These competitors have significant advantages due to
their ability to influence or control the computing platforms,
security layers, and network tiers on, or in, which security
products operate. In addition, these competitors generally have
significantly greater financial, marketing, or technological
resources than we do. We believe that our ability to compete in
the enterprise security and administration markets going forward
depends in part on providing comprehensive, solution-oriented
integrated offerings that secure and manage customers’ most
important asset — their information.

Some of the companies that offer competing products to our
Consumer Products offerings include Check Point Software,
Computer Associates, Doctor Ahn, Internet Security Services,
Kroll, McAfee (formerly Network Associates), Norman, Panda, and
Trend Micro. With the constantly evolving Internet-based
security threat environment, several other companies have
entered the market and may become significant competitors in the
future.

Our Enterprise Security Services compete with companies such as
Counterpane, IBM, Internet Security Systems, Ubizen, and
VeriSign.

Price competition is intense for most of our products and
services. We expect price competition to continue to increase
and become even more significant in the future, which may reduce
our profit margins.

We also face competition from a number of other products that
offer levels of functionality different from those offered by
our products or that were designed for a somewhat different
group of end-users than those targeted by us. Microsoft has
added security features to new versions of its operating system
products that provide some of the same functions offered in our
products. Microsoft’s acquisition of GeCad’s antivirus
technology could lead it to include antivirus functions in
future versions of its operating system products or as a
stand-alone consumer product. In addition, vendors of other
operating systems, such as Red Hat® Linux, Solaris, and
Unix-based operating systems, may also incorporate some of the
advanced utilities or other functionality offered in our
products. Also, certain ISPs provide security functionality to
their subscribers at no additional fee.

While we plan to continue to improve our products by providing
enhanced functionality to current and future operating systems,
these efforts may be unsuccessful and any improved products may
not be commercially accepted by users. We will continue to
cooperate with operating system vendors to make our products
compatible with those operating systems while at the same time
differentiating our utility products from features included in
those operating systems. Our efforts in this regard may be
unsuccessful.

The demand for some of our products, including those currently
under development, may decrease if, among other reasons:

•

Microsoft includes additional product features in future
    releases of Windows or as stand-alone products

•

Hardware vendors, including Cisco, incorporate additional
    server-based network management and security tools into network
    operating systems

•

Operating system, network equipment, or computer hardware
    manufacturers license, develop, or acquire technology or
    products that provide functionality directly competitive with
    our product and service offerings



•

ISPs continue to provide security functionality to their
    subscribers at no additional fee

In addition, we compete with other computer software companies,
operating system providers, and network equipment and computer
hardware manufacturers for access to retail distribution
channels and for the attention of customers at the retail level
and in corporate accounts. We also compete with other software
companies, operating system providers, and network equipment and
computer hardware manufacturers to acquire products or companies
and to publish software developed by third parties.

Some of our existing and potential competitors have greater
financial, marketing, or technological resources than we do. We
believe that competition in the industry will continue to
intensify as other major software companies expand their product
lines into additional product categories, and as operating
system providers and network equipment and computer hardware
manufacturers attempt to leverage their strengths at the
computing platform, security layer, and network tier to compete
more aggressively in the market for security solutions.

Manufacturing

Our product development groups produce a set of master compact
disc read-only memory, or CD-ROMs, or diskettes, and
documentation for each product that is then duplicated or
replicated and packaged into products by our logistics
organization. United States purchasing of all raw materials is
performed by an outside organization. This outside contractor,
under the supervision of our domestic logistics organization,
performs all of our domestic manufacturing and order
fulfillment. Manufacturing includes the replication of CD-ROMs,
printing of documentation materials and retail boxes, and
assembly of the final packages. Purchasing is done by Symantec
personnel for products manufactured in our Dublin, Ireland
facility. For most products distributed outside of North and
South America, our Dublin, Ireland manufacturing facility
performs diskette duplication, assembly of the final packages,
and order fulfillment. Our Dublin, Ireland manufacturing
facility also subcontracts to outside organizations for the
replication of CD-ROMs and printing of documentation materials
and retail boxes.

Intellectual Property

We regard our software as proprietary. We attempt to protect our
software technology by relying on a combination of copyright,
patent, trade secret and trademark laws, restrictions on
disclosure, and other methods. In particular, we have a
substantial number of registered trademarks and currently hold a
substantial number of patents in the United States, as well as
patent holdings in other countries, which expire at various
times over the next twenty years. We regularly file other
applications for patents and trademarks in order to protect
proprietary intellectual property that we believe are important
to our business. We also license some intellectual property from
third parties for use in our products.

We face a number of risks relating to our intellectual property,
including unauthorized use and unauthorized copying, or piracy,
of our software solutions. Litigation may be necessary to
enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect trade
secrets or trademarks, or to determine the validity and scope of
the proprietary rights of others. Patents that have been issued
to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be
enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction.
Furthermore, other parties have asserted and may, in the future,
assert infringement claims against us. For further discussion of
our current litigation, see Note 14 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. These claims and any
litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights.
Litigation, even if not meritorious, could result in substantial
costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In
addition, third party licenses may not continue to be available
to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.

Employees

As of March 31, 2005, we employed approximately 6,500
people worldwide, including approximately 3,300 in sales,
marketing, and related activities, 1,700 in product development,
400 in services, and 1,100 in management, manufacturing,
administration, and finance.



In connection with the relocation of our Leiden, Netherlands
operations to Dublin, Ireland in early fiscal 2003, a group of
employees in the Leiden facility joined a union to negotiate the
proposed terms of the transfer of operations to our Dublin
facility, focusing primarily on severance benefits for employees
that did not relocate to Dublin. In addition, the Italian Trade
Union and a French Symantec Works Council both have agreements
with Symantec that govern parts of the employment relationship
in the respective countries. Except for these instances, no
other employees are represented by a labor union. We believe
that relations with our employees are good.

Item 2:

Properties

The following table sets forth the location, approximate square
footage and use of each significant location used by Symantec:

We also lease additional properties throughout the world,
primarily in North America and Europe, for which the square
footage is individually insignificant. We also lease 148,000
square feet in Oregon, which is currently vacant. We are
currently building a facility in Culver City, California which
we expect to occupy in 2007, and we recently purchased a
facility in Dublin, Ireland that we expect to occupy by the end
of 2005.



We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for current
needs and that the productive capacity in such facilities is
substantially being utilized.

On January 16, 2001, our Board of Directors replaced an
earlier stock repurchase authorization with a new authorization
to repurchase up to $700 million of Symantec common stock,
not to exceed 60.0 million shares, with no expiration date.
On January 20, 2004, our Board of Directors increased the
dollar amount of our stock repurchase authorization from
$700 million to $940 million, without any specific
limit on the number of shares to be repurchased. On
October 19, 2004, our Board of Directors increased the
dollar amount of our stock repurchase authorization by
$300 million, without any specific limit on the number of
shares to be repurchased. In connection with the stock
repurchase authorizations, we have a repurchase plan under
Rule 10b5-1 to facilitate stock repurchases up to
$60 million per quarter. Pending the completion of the



proposed merger with VERITAS, we will be subject to a regulatory
limitation that limits the level of quarterly repurchases
allowed.

During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 7.8 million shares under
the amended stock repurchase authorization, at prices ranging
from $21.05 to $30.77 per share, for an aggregate amount of
$192 million. During fiscal 2004, we repurchased
3.0 million shares under the amended stock repurchase
authorization, at prices ranging from $19.52 to $20.82 per
share, for an aggregate amount of $60 million. During
fiscal 2003, we repurchased 8.8 million shares at prices
ranging from $6.99 to $7.49 per share, for an aggregate
amount of $64 million.

On March 28, 2005, the Board of Directors increased the
dollar amount of authorized stock repurchases by $3 billion
effective upon completion of the VERITAS merger, without any
specific limit on the number of shares to be repurchased. We
expect to repurchase shares pursuant to this authorization for
cash as business conditions warrant between the date of the
completion of the merger and March 31, 2006. Excluding the
post-merger authorization, as of March 31, 2005,
$475 million remained authorized by our Board of Directors.

Item 7:

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

Symantec is the global leader in information security providing
a broad range of software, appliances, and services designed to
help individuals, small and mid-sized businesses, and large
enterprises secure and manage their information technology, or
IT, infrastructure. Symantec’s Norton brand of products is
the worldwide leader in consumer security and problem-solving
solutions. Founded in 1982, we have offices in 38 countries
worldwide.

We have a 52/53-week fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all
references as of and for the periods ended March 31, 2005,
2004, and 2003 reflect amounts as of and for the periods ended
April 1, 2005, April 2, 2004, and March 28, 2003,
respectively. The fiscal accounting years ended April 1,
2005 and March 28, 2003 are each comprised of 52 weeks
of operations, while the fiscal accounting year ended
April 2, 2004 is comprised of 53 weeks of operations.
The fiscal accounting year ending March 31, 2006 will
comprise 52 weeks of operations.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and
related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles requires us to make estimates, which include
judgments and assumptions, that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based
our estimates on historical experience and on various
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances and we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis
and make changes accordingly. Historically, our estimates
relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed
materially from actual results; however, actual results may
differ from these estimates under different conditions. If
actual results differ from these estimates and other
considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in
Symantec’s consolidated financial statements, the resulting
changes could have a material adverse



effect on Symantec’s consolidated statement of income, and
in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on
liquidity and Symantec’s financial condition.

A critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and
assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time
the estimate is made. Different estimates that reasonably could
have been used, or changes in accounting estimates could
materially impact the financial statements. We believe that the
estimates described below represent our critical accounting
estimates, as they have the greatest potential impact on our
consolidated financial statements. We also refer you to our
“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” beginning
on page 63 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Management has discussed the development and selection of its
critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of
Symantec’s Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has
reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software
industry. Revenue recognition requirements in the software
industry are very complex and they require us to make many
estimates.

We expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate
inventory to meet future customer demand, which is generally 4
to 6 weeks of customer demand based on recent buying
trends. We ship product to our distributors and resellers at
their request and based on their valid purchase orders. Our
distributors and resellers base the quantity of their orders on
their estimates to meet future customer demand, which may exceed
our expected level of a 4 to 6 week supply. We offer
limited rights of return if the inventory held by our
distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a 4 to
6 week supply. We estimate future returns under these
limited rights of return in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 48,

Revenue
Recognition When Right of Return Exists.

We typically offer
liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors
and resellers exceeds the expected level. Because we cannot
reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be
returned, we do not recognize revenue or record accounts
receivable for the amount in excess of the expected inventory
levels. On the same basis, we reduce the associated cost of
revenues, which is primarily related to materials, and include
this amount in inventory. We recognize these revenues and the
associated cost of revenues when the liberal rights of return
expire, which is when the inventory levels no longer exceed the
expected level of a 4 to 6 week supply. If we made
different estimates, material differences may result in the
amount and timing of our net revenues and cost of revenues for
any period presented.

As of each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, 2004,
and 2003, the amount of net revenues not recognized related to
excess inventory represented no more than 3% of total net
revenues recognized during each of the years then ended.
Associated costs that were included in inventory as of each of
the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003
represented no more than 2% of the total cost of revenues
recorded during each of the years then ended.

In arrangements that include multiple elements, including
perpetual software licenses and maintenance and/or services, and
packaged products with content updates, we allocate and defer
revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor-specific
objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered
elements, and recognize the difference between the total
arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered
items as revenue. Our deferred revenue consists primarily of the
unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance and
consumer product content updates and totaled $1.3 billion
as of March 31, 2005, of which $115 million was
represented as long-term deferred revenue, on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. VSOE of each element is based on the price for
which the undelivered element is sold separately. We determine
fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical
evidence of our stand-alone sales of these elements to third
parties. When VSOE does not exist for undelivered items such as
maintenance, then the entire arrangement fee is recognized
ratably over the performance period. Changes to the elements in
a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those
elements, the fair value of the



respective elements, and changes to a product’s estimated
life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and
unearned revenue.

Reserves for Product Returns

End-users may return our products, primarily within our Consumer
Products and Enterprise Administration segments, through
distributors and resellers or to us directly for a full refund
within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase. Our
estimated reserves for such end-user product returns, which are
recorded as an offset to revenue, are based primarily on
historical trends. We fully reserve for obsolete products in the
distribution channels as an offset to revenue. If we made
different estimates, material differences may result in the
amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented.
More or less product may be returned than what was estimated
and/or the amount of inventory in the channel could be different
than what was estimated. These factors and unanticipated changes
in the economic and industry environment could make our return
estimates differ from actual results. For additional information
see Schedule II on page 98.

Reserves for Rebates

We estimate and record reserves as an offset to revenue for
channel and end-user rebates, related primarily to products
within our Consumer Products, Enterprise Security, and
Enterprise Administration segments. Our estimated reserves for
channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors’
and resellers’ actual performance against the terms and
conditions of volume incentive rebate programs, which are
typically entered into quarterly. Our reserves for end-user
rebates are estimated on the terms and conditions of the
promotional programs, actual sales during the promotion, amount
of actual redemptions received, historical redemption trends by
product and by type of promotional program, and the value of the
rebate. We also consider current market conditions and economic
trends when estimating our reserves for rebates. If we made
different estimates, material differences may result in the
amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented.
For additional information see Schedule II on page 98.

Business Combinations

When we acquire businesses, we allocate the purchase price to
tangible assets and liabilities acquired and identifiable
intangible assets. Any residual purchase price is recorded as
goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires
management to make significant estimates in determining the fair
values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially
with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based on
historical experience and information obtained from the
management of the acquired companies. These estimates can
include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is
expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted
average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be
derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently
uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, unanticipated events
and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or
validity of such estimates.

At March 31, 2005, goodwill was $1.4 billion, acquired
product rights were $128 million, and other identifiable
intangible assets were $31 million. We assess the
impairment of goodwill within our reporting units annually, or
more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may not be recoverable. We assess the
impairment of acquired product rights and other identifiable
intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. An
impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the future
net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and
its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. Such
impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the
carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. The estimate of
cash flow is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions
about expected future operating performance and an appropriate
discount rate determined by our management. Our estimates of
discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to,
among other things, economic conditions, changes to the business
model, or changes in operating performance. If we made different
estimates, material differences may result in write-downs of net
long-lived and intangible assets, which would be reflected by
charges to our operating results for any period presented.



Accounting for Excess Facilities

We have estimated expenses for excess facilities related to
consolidating, moving, and relocating various groups or sites as
a result of restructuring activities and business acquisitions.
In determining our estimates, we obtained information from third
party leasing agents to calculate anticipated third party
sublease income and the vacancy period prior to finding a
sub-lessee. Market conditions will affect our ability to
sublease facilities on terms consistent with our estimates. Our
ability to sublease facilities on schedule or to negotiate lease
terms resulting in higher or lower sublease income than
estimated will affect our accrual for site closures. Differences
between estimates of related broker commissions, tenant
improvements, and related exit costs may increase or decrease
our accrual upon final negotiation. If we made different
estimates regarding these various components of our excess
facilities costs, the amount recorded for any period presented
could vary materially from those actually recorded.

Income Taxes

We make significant estimates to determine our current provision
for income taxes, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities
and our income taxes payable. Our estimates relative to the
current provision for income taxes take into account current tax
laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible
outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and
domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax laws or our
interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and
future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts
provided for income taxes in our financial position and results
of operations. We also assess the likelihood that our net
deferred tax assets will be realized. Realization of our net
deferred tax assets is dependent upon future United States
taxable income and future taxable income in certain foreign
jurisdictions, as well as our implementation of prudent and
feasible tax planning strategies. Our estimates regarding future
profitability may change due to future market conditions,
changes in United States or international tax laws, and other
factors. To the extent we believe it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of our net deferred tax assets will not
be realized, we establish a valuation allowance against the
deferred tax assets. To the extent we establish a valuation
allowance or change the allowance in a period, we reflect the
change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax
provision in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Legal Contingencies

From time to time, we are involved in disputes that arise in the
ordinary course of business, and we do not expect this trend to
change in the future. We are currently involved in legal
proceedings as discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

When the likelihood of the incurrence of costs related to our
legal proceedings is probable and management has the ability to
estimate such costs, we provide for estimates of external legal
fees and any probable losses through charges to our Consolidated
Statements of Income. These estimates have been based on our
assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet
date and are subject to change based upon new information and
intervening events. Our accrual for legal contingencies as of
March 31, 2005 represented insignificant amounts related to
external legal fees and no amounts were accrued for probable
losses as we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the
claims against us, and we will defend ourselves vigorously.
However, even if we are successful, estimated costs for external
legal fees could be more than anticipated. If we are
unsuccessful, we might be forced to pay significant damages and
licensing fees for which we have not accrued any amounts for
loss contingencies, or to modify our business practices. Any
such results could materially harm our business and could result
in a material adverse impact on our financial position, results
of operations, or cash flows.

Results of Operations

Overview

In fiscal 2005, we continued to pursue our goal of serving
customer needs while reshaping the competitive landscape by
offering new versions of integrated solutions. We believe that
we continued to make progress



toward this goal as we introduced several new product offerings
while posting substantial growth in revenue and earnings.

We operate our business within five operating segments: Consumer
Products, Enterprise Security, Enterprise Administration,
Services, and Other.

Within the Consumer Products segment, we continued to grow our
base of individual users and accelerated our expansion into the
small business market. Our Norton brand of consumer security
products continued as a market leader in desktop protection. In
addition, we released new versions of our award-winning consumer
products, including
Norton

tm

Internet Security, Norton AntiVirus, Norton Personal Firewall,
Norton
AntiSpam

tm

,
and Norton SystemWorks. These new products provide protection
from viruses, intrusion attempts, and piracy threats, and offer
expanded protection from emerging threats.

Within the Enterprise Security segment, we continued to enhance
and expand our product portfolio in order to address the
evolving threat environment with the release of new versions of
our integrated solutions: Symantec Gateway Security, Symantec
Enterprise Security Manager, and Symantec Incident Manager. In
addition, we maintained our focus on enhanced manageability and
more comprehensive intrusion protection.

The Enterprise Administration segment continued to benefit from
our new product introductions, including the ON

i

Command

tm

product family related to our business acquisition of ON
Technology, and Symantec Client Migration and the
LiveState

tm

Recovery product family related to our business acquisition of
PowerQuest, both of which were acquired in the second half of
fiscal 2004. Sales of our pcAnywhere product continued to
decline and we expect this trend to continue due to the extended
functionality of Microsoft operating system products.

On a worldwide basis, we closed bigger deals driven by the depth
and breadth of our product and service offerings. Specifically,
we generated 1,347 enterprise deals greater than $100,000 each,
including 353 deals greater than $300,000 each, and 63 deals
greater than $1 million each. Deals greater than
$1 million increased 85% in fiscal 2005 as compared to
fiscal 2004. In addition, 59% of the deals greater than $100,000
involved multiple Symantec enterprise products and services.

Cashflows were strong in fiscal 2005 as we delivered over
$1.2 billion in operating cash flow. We no longer carry any
debt due to the conversion of our convertible subordinated notes
during fiscal 2005 and we ended fiscal 2005 with
$3.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments.

Net revenues during fiscal 2005 increased as compared to fiscal
2004 due primarily to increased sales of our consumer and
enterprise security products. We believe that a significant
portion of the growth in demand was attributable to the
continued increase in vulnerabilities, Internet attacks, and
malicious code activity coupled with a growing level of
awareness of these threats around the world. This growth in
demand may not continue and, if it does not, our revenue growth
rate may not be sustainable.

Net revenues during fiscal 2004 increased as compared to fiscal
2003 due primarily to increased sales of our consumer and
enterprise security products, which can be attributed to the
numerous security threat outbreaks that occurred during fiscal
2004, including the Beagle, Welchia, Blaster, Sobig, MyDoom, and
Netsky viruses. Increased demand for our security protection
solutions from large organizations as well as from small
businesses and consumers also contributed to the growth.

From a regional standpoint, sales outside of the United States
contributed strongly to revenue growth while sales in the United
States also grew during these periods. Strength in major foreign
currencies during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 also positively
impacted our international revenue growth.

A significant portion of our deferred revenue balance of
$971 million as of March 31, 2004 contributed to our
total net revenues during fiscal 2005. Deferred revenue
increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due
primarily to increased maintenance obligations.

Our net income was $536 million, $371 million, and
$248 million for fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively,
representing $0.74, $0.54, and $0.38 net income per diluted
share, respectively. Our increased profitability is primarily
the result of revenue growth offset in part by an increase in
operating expenses largely



attributable to an increase in employee headcount and related
compensation. Approximately 75% of our headcount increase was
due to the growth of the company and approximately 25% was due
to business acquisitions.

During fiscal 2005, we acquired the following businesses:

On January 28, 2005, we purchased technology patents from
ReefEdge, Inc. for $800,000 in cash, which we recorded as
acquired product rights.

On December 16, 2004, we announced a definitive agreement
with VERITAS Software Corporation, or VERITAS, a leading
independent supplier of storage and infrastructure software
products and services. Under this agreement, we would acquire
all of the outstanding stock of VERITAS in exchange for
1.1242 shares of Symantec common stock for each outstanding
share of VERITAS common stock. In addition, we would assume all
outstanding VERITAS stock options with an exercise price less
than or equal to $49.00 per share, as well as each
outstanding option that was granted under certain specified
VERITAS option plans, as adjusted in accordance with the
exchange ratio. All other outstanding VERITAS stock options
would be cancelled. The estimated purchase price is
$13 billion, which includes the estimated fair value of
Symantec common stock to be issued and VERITAS options to be
assumed, as well as estimated direct transaction costs. We
derived this estimate using an average market price per share of
Symantec common stock of $25.87, which was based on an average
of the closing prices for a range of trading days
(December 14, 2004 through December 20, 2004,
inclusive) around the announcement date (December 16, 2004)
of the proposed transaction. The final purchase price would be
determined based upon the number of VERITAS shares and options
outstanding at the closing date. Completion of the transaction
is subject to customary closing conditions that include, among
others, receipt of required approvals from Symantec and VERITAS
stockholders. Under terms specified in the merger agreement,
Symantec or VERITAS may terminate the agreement and as a result
either Symantec or VERITAS may be required to pay a
$440 million termination fee to the other party in certain
circumstances. While we currently anticipate that we will be in
a position to complete the merger on or prior to June 30,
2005, we believe that there may be administrative benefits to
completing the merger at the beginning of our second quarter of
fiscal 2006. Symantec and VERITAS have therefore discussed the
possibility of closing the merger during the first week of that
fiscal quarter. Unless otherwise indicated, the discussions in
this document relate to Symantec as a stand-alone entity and do
not reflect the impact of the pending business combination
transaction with VERITAS.

Information about the various factors that management deems
important in contributing to our operating results for fiscal
year 2005, 2004, and 2003 is provided in the discussion below.

Net revenues increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal
2004 due primarily to increases of $443 million and
$191 million in sales of our consumer and enterprise
security products, respectively. The increased sales of these
products were due primarily to continuing growth in demand for
our consumer security protection products and our enterprise
virus protection solutions. We believe that a significant
portion of the growth in demand was attributable to the
continued increase in vulnerabilities, Internet attacks, and
malicious code activity coupled with a growing level of
awareness of these threats around the world. This growth in
demand may not continue and, if it does not, our revenue growth
rate may not be sustainable.

Net revenues increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal
2003 due primarily to increases of $302 million and
$143 million in sales of our consumer and enterprise
security products, respectively. The increased sales of these
products were due primarily to continuing growth in demand for
our consumer security protection products and our enterprise
virus protection solutions. We believe that a significant
portion of the growth in demand during fiscal 2004 was
attributable to the numerous security threat outbreaks that
occurred during the year.

Our Consumer Products segment focuses on delivering our Internet
security and problem-solving products to individual users, home
offices, and small businesses. We believe that a significant
portion of the increase in revenues from our Consumer Products
segment in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004, was
attributable to the continued increase in vulnerabilities,
Internet attacks, and malicious code activity coupled with a
growing level of awareness of these threats around the world,
and this growth may not be sustainable. Specifically, the
increase in our Consumer Products revenue during fiscal 2005 was
due primarily to an increase of $231 million in sales of
our Norton Internet Security products, a comprehensive security
solution, and an increase of $185 million in sales of our
Norton AntiVirus products. Sales through our electronic
distribution channel (which includes sales of our Norton
Internet Security products and our Norton AntiVirus products),
including original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, subscription
renewals, grew by $297 million in fiscal 2005 as compared
to fiscal 2004.

We believe that a significant portion of the increase in
revenues from our Consumer Products segment in fiscal 2004, as
compared to fiscal 2003, was attributable to the numerous
security threat outbreaks that occurred in August 2003 and
February 2004. Specifically, the increase in revenue from our
Consumer Products segment during fiscal 2004 as compared to
fiscal 2003 was due primarily to increases of $188 million
and $129 million in sales of our Norton AntiVirus and
Norton Internet Security products, respectively. We experienced
growth in our electronic distribution channel, including OEM
subscription renewals, where sales grew by $223 million in
fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. These increases were
offset slightly by a decrease in sales of our other consumer
products.

and at the client tier, including desktop personal computers, or
PCs, laptops, and handhelds. Revenue from our Enterprise
Security segment increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to
fiscal 2004 due primarily to an increase of $148 million in
sales of our antivirus products. In addition, revenue increased
due to sales of antispam products formerly associated with
Brightmail, which we acquired in June 2004.

Similarly, revenue from our Enterprise Security segment
increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due
primarily to a $131 million increase in sales of our
antivirus products. This increase was attributable to the
numerous security threat outbreaks that occurred in August 2003
and February 2004.

Our Enterprise Administration segment offers open and modular
products and services that enable companies to effectively and
efficiently manage their IT infrastructures. Revenue from our
Enterprise Administration segment increased during fiscal 2005
as compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to sales of products
formerly associated with PowerQuest of $64 million and ON
Technology of $29 million, which were acquired in the
second half of fiscal 2004. These increases were partially
offset by a continued decline in sales of our pcAnywhere
product. We expect sales of our pcAnywhere product to continue
to decline in the future.

Revenue from our Enterprise Administration segment increased
during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due primarily to
sales of PowerQuest products of $18 million and sales of ON
Technology products of $6 million, after the respective
dates of acquisition. These increases were partially offset by a
decrease in sales of our pcAnywhere product of $19 million.

success. The increase in revenue from our Services segment
during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was due primarily
to an increase of $11 million in sales of our consulting
services. In addition, revenue from our Services segment



increased due to the @stake, Inc. and LIRIC Associates
acquisitions. We expect our Services revenue will continue to
increase in the future.

The increase in revenue from our Services segment during fiscal

***

The Americas include net revenues from the United States of
    $714 million, Canada of $54 million, and Latin America

The increase in net revenues in international regions in fiscal
2005 was due to increased sales of our Norton Internet Security
and Norton AntiVirus products in our Consumer Products segment
and our antivirus products in our Enterprise Security segment in
those regions. We believe this increase in sales is attributable
to increased customer awareness related to security threats. In
addition, strength in major foreign currencies positively
impacted our international revenue growth during fiscal 2005 by
$74 million, as compared to fiscal 2004. The strength in
foreign currencies is due primarily to the strength of the Euro.
We are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future
periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency rates.
If international sales become a greater proportion of our total
sales in the future, changes in foreign exchange rates may have
a potentially greater impact on our revenues and operating
results.

The increase in net revenues in international regions in fiscal
2004 was due primarily to increased sales of our Norton Internet
Security and Norton AntiVirus products in our Consumer Products
segment and our



antivirus products in our Enterprise Security segment in those
regions. In addition, strength in major foreign currencies
positively impacted our international revenue growth during
fiscal 2004 by $128 million, as compared to fiscal 2003.

Gross profit represents net revenues less cost of revenues. Cost
of revenues consists primarily of payments to OEMs under
revenue-sharing arrangements, costs for producing manuals and
CDs, fee-based technical support costs, costs of services,
royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing
agreements, packaging costs, manufacturing expenses, and
amortization of acquired product rights.

Gross margin remained flat at approximately 82% during fiscal
years 2005, 2004, and 2003. We anticipate that our net revenues
from our Services segment may grow and comprise a higher
percentage of our total net revenues, which would have a
negative impact on our gross margin, as our services typically
have higher cost of revenues than our software products.

primarily associated with the Brightmail acquisition in June
2004 and the PowerQuest acquisition in December 2003. This
increase was partially offset by certain acquired product rights
becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2005. The increased
amortization during fiscal 2004, as compared to fiscal 2003, is
primarily associated with the purchase of a security technology
patent as part of a settlement in

In connection with the acquisition of Brightmail in June 2004,
we assumed unvested Brightmail stock options in exchange for
unvested options to purchase Symantec common stock. The
intrinsic value of the assumed unvested stock options was
$21 million and represented deferred stock-based
compensation. During the September 2004 quarter, we reduced
deferred stock-based compensation by $1 million as a result
of the cancellation of a portion of those options upon employee
terminations. We recorded amortization of deferred stock-based
compensation related to the assumed Brightmail stock options of
$3 million during fiscal 2005. We anticipate that
amortization of deferred stock-based compensation related to the
assumed Brightmail options will be approximately $8 million
in fiscal 2006.

On October 20, 2004, we issued 200,000 restricted shares of
common stock to our current Senior Vice President of Finance and
Chief Financial Officer, at a purchase price of $1,000
(representing the aggregate par value at the time of issuance),
vesting 50% at each anniversary date. The market value of the
common stock on the date of grant, less the purchase price, was
$6 million and was recorded in Deferred stock-based
compensation within Stockholders’ Equity in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets during fiscal 2005. The deferred
stock-based compensation is being amortized over the two-year
service period beginning in October 2004. We recorded
amortization of deferred stock-based compensation related to the
restricted shares of $1 million during fiscal 2005.

PowerQuest

The in-process technology acquired in the PowerQuest acquisition
consisted primarily of research and development related to its
Virtual Volume Imaging technology, which provides the capability
to recover from server or desktop failures and minimize system
downtime. We are integrating this technology into our Enterprise
Administration segment product offerings.

Nexland

The in-process technology acquired in the Nexland acquisition
consisted primarily of research and development related to a
next generation firewall product. We integrated this technology
into our firewall and appliance series of products within our

Riptech

The in-process technology acquired in the Riptech acquisition
consisted primarily of research and development related to the
fourth generation of its
Caltarian

tm

technology, which provides real-time information protection
through around-the-clock monitoring, analysis and response. We
integrated this technology into our managed security services
within our Services segment.

Recourse

The in-process technology acquired in the Recourse acquisition
consisted primarily of research and development related to new
versions of
ManHunt

tm

,
a network intrusion detection system. We integrated this
technology into our intrusion detection products within our
Enterprise Security segment.

SecurityFocus

The in-process technology acquired in the SecurityFocus
acquisition consisted primarily of research and development
related to new versions of DeepSight Threat Management System
and DeepSight Analyzer products, which are threat management
systems that provide early warnings of attack, as well as
countermeasures to defend against these attacks. We integrated
this technology into our vulnerability management products
within our Enterprise Security segment.

The efforts required to develop the acquired in-process
technology principally relate to the completion of all planning,
design, development, and test activities that are necessary to
establish that the product or service can be produced to meet
its design specifications including features, functions, and
performance.

We determined the fair value of the acquired in-process
technology by estimating the projected cash flows related to
these projects and future revenues to be earned upon
commercialization of the products. We discounted the resulting
cash flows back to their net present values. We based the net
cash flows from such projects on our analysis of the respective
markets and estimates of revenues and operating profits related
to these projects.

termination of 51 employees located in the United States and
Europe due to the consolidation and relocation of engineering
and development functions. In addition we recorded an increase
to the accrual of $1 million relating to the fiscal 2002



restructuring plan due to the termination of a sublease
agreement for facilities in Eugene, Oregon. As of March 31,
2005, substantially all of the costs were paid.

During fiscal 2004, we recorded $1 million of restructuring
charges for costs of severance, related benefits, and
outplacement services for a member of our senior management
team, as well as an increase to the accrual for excess
facilities in Eugene, Oregon in connection with our fiscal 2002
restructuring plan. As of March 31, 2005, substantially all
of the costs were paid.

During fiscal 2003, we recorded $11 million of
restructuring charges, including costs of severance, related
benefits, and outplacement services of $8 million and costs
associated with the consolidation of certain facilities in the
United States and Europe of $3 million. The costs resulted
from relocating certain development, sales, and finance
activities, realigning certain worldwide marketing efforts, and
outsourcing our North American and European consumer support
functions. As a result, we terminated 424 employees. As of
March 31, 2005, substantially all of the costs were paid.

In connection with our proposed merger with VERITAS, we may
incur substantial restructuring costs in future periods. We may
ultimately record liabilities for severance or relocation costs
related to VERITAS employees, costs of vacating some facilities
(leased or owned) of VERITAS, or other costs associated with
exiting activities of VERITAS. Any such liabilities would be
recorded as an adjustment to the purchase price and an increase
in goodwill. In addition, we may incur significant restructuring
charges upon completion of the merger or in subsequent quarters
for severance or relocation costs related to Symantec employees,
costs of vacating some facilities (leased or owned) of Symantec,
and other costs associated with exiting activities of Symantec.
Any such restructuring charges would be recorded as an expense
in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which
they were incurred.

Integration Planning

On December 16, 2004, we announced a definitive agreement
with VERITAS under which we would acquire all the outstanding
stock of VERITAS. In connection with this pending acquisition,
we have recorded integration planning costs of $3.5 million
in fiscal 2005.

Patent Settlement

On May 12, 2005, we resolved the Altiris patent litigation
matters with a cross-licensing agreement that resolves all legal
claims between the companies. As part of a settlement, we paid
Altiris $10 million for use of the disputed technology.
This transaction will be recorded in the June 2005 quarter.

On March 31, 2005, we entered into a patent license
agreement with Tumbleweed Communications Corporation. The total
cost of the patent license agreement was $1 million, which
was paid in cash in March 2005. Under the transaction, we
recorded $375,000 of patent settlement costs in the March 2005
quarter that was related to benefits received by us in and prior
to the March 2005 quarter. The remaining amount was recorded as
an asset and is being amortized to Cost of revenues in the
Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining life of the
patent, which expires in March 2010.

On August 6, 2003, we purchased a security technology
patent as part of a settlement in

Hilgraeve, Inc. v.
Symantec Corporation.

As part of the settlement, we also
received licenses to the remaining patents in Hilgraeve’s
portfolio. The total cost of purchasing the patent and licensing
additional patents was $63 million, which was paid in cash
in August 2003. Under the transaction, we recorded
$14 million of patent settlement costs in the June 2003
quarter that was related to benefits received by us in and prior
to the June 2003 quarter. The remaining $49 million was

The increase in interest and other income, net in fiscal 2005 as
compared to fiscal 2004, was due to a higher average investment
balance and higher average interest rates. The increase in
interest and other income, net in fiscal 2004 as compared to
fiscal 2003, was due to a higher average investment balance,
partially offset by lower average interest rates.

Interest expense during fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003 was
primarily related to the issuance of our $600 million
3% convertible subordinated notes in October 2001. In
November 2004, substantially all of the outstanding convertible
subordinated notes were converted into 70.3 million shares
of our common stock and the remainder was redeemed for cash. We
will not incur further interest expense with respect to these
notes.

Income, net of expense, from sale of technologies and product
lines during fiscal 2004 and 2003 primarily related to royalty
payments received in connection with the licensing of
substantially all of the ACT! product line technology. In
December 2003, Interact purchased this technology from us.

Our effective tax rate on income before taxes was approximately
38%, 32%, and 32% during fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003
respectively. The higher effective tax rate in fiscal 2005
reflects the additional tax expense attributable to the
$500 million of foreign earnings that we repatriated under
the American Jobs Creation Act.

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004-Repatriation of Foreign
Earnings

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004, or the Jobs Act, was signed into law. Under the Jobs Act,
we may elect an 85% dividends-received deduction for
repatriating eligible dividends from our foreign subsidiaries in
either the year ended March 31, 2005 or 2006. Certain
criteria must be met to qualify for the deduction, including the
establishment of a domestic reinvestment plan by our Chief
Executive Officer, and the approval of the plan by our Board of
Directors, whereby the repatriated earnings must be reinvested
in the United States. The maximum amount of our foreign earnings
that qualify for the deduction is $500 million.

During the March 2005 quarter, we repatriated $500 million
from certain of our foreign subsidiaries under the Jobs Act
provisions. We recorded a tax charge for this repatriation of
approximately $54 million in accordance with tax laws
existing at the time.

The $500 million repatriation under the Jobs Act was deemed
to be distributed entirely from foreign earnings that had been
previously treated as indefinitely reinvested. However, this
distribution from previously indefinitely reinvested earnings
does not change our position going forward that future earnings
of certain of our foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely
reinvested.

In May 2005, clarifying language was issued by the
U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue
Service with respect to the treatment of foreign taxes paid on
the earnings repatriated under the Jobs Act. As a result of this
clarifying language, we will reduce the $54 million tax
expense attributable to the $500 million repatriation by
approximately $20 million, to $34 million. This
reduction in tax expense will be recorded in our first quarter
of fiscal 2006.

Our principal source of liquidity as of March 31, 2005 is
our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments
of $3.2 billion, as well as cash that we generate over time
from our operations. We believe that our cash balances and the
cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy
our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital
expenditures for at least the next 12 months.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2005
resulted largely from net income of $536 million, plus
non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of
$132 million, the income tax benefit from employee stock
plans of $109 million, and deferred income taxes of
$61 million. In addition, our deferred revenue increased by
$319 million and income taxes payable increased by
$56 million. We expect operating cash flow to continue to
be positive in the future.



Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2004
resulted largely from net income of $371 million, plus
non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of
$117 million and the income tax benefit from employee stock
plans of $67 million. Deferred revenue increased by
$345 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts
receivable of $83 million. In addition, income taxes
payable increased by $54 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2003
resulted largely from net income of $248 million, plus
non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of
$103 million and the income tax benefit from employee stock
plans of $40 million. Deferred revenue increased by
$223 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts
receivable of $48 million.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2005 was
primarily the result of payments for business acquisitions of
$424 million and net purchases of short-term investments of
$143 million.

Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2004 was
primarily the result of net purchases of short-term investments
of $332 million, payments for business acquisitions of
$287 million, and capital expenditures of $111 million.

Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2003 was
primarily the result of payments for business acquisitions of
$376 million and net purchases of short-term investments of
$323 million.

We expect to continue our investing activities, including
investments in short-term instruments. Furthermore, cash
reserves may be used for strategic acquisitions of software
companies or technologies that are complementary to our business.

Financing Activities

During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 7.8 million shares under
our stock repurchase authorization approved by our Board of
Directors, at prices ranging from $21.05 to $30.77 per
share, for an aggregate amount of $192 million. In
addition, during fiscal 2005, we received $160 million from
the sale of our common stock through employee benefit plans.

During fiscal 2004, we received $189 million from the sale
of our common stock through employee benefit plans. In addition,
we repurchased 3.0 million shares under our stock
repurchase authorization approved by our Board of Directors, at
prices ranging from $19.52 to $20.82 per share, for an
aggregate amount of $60 million.

During fiscal 2003, we received $138 million from the sale
of our common stock through employee benefit plans. In addition,
we repurchased 8.8 million shares at prices ranging from
$6.99 to $7.49 per share, for an aggregate amount of
$64 million.

On January 16, 2001, our Board of Directors replaced an
earlier stock repurchase authorization with a new authorization
to repurchase up to $700 million of Symantec common stock,
not to exceed 60.0 million shares, with no expiration date.
On January 20, 2004, our Board of Directors increased the
dollar amount of our stock repurchase authorization from
$700 million to $940 million, without any specific
limit on the number of shares to be repurchased. On
October 19, 2004, our Board of Directors increased the
dollar amount of our stock repurchase authorization by
$300 million, without any specific limit on the number of
shares to be repurchased. In connection with the stock
repurchase authorizations, we have a repurchase plan under
Rule 10b5-1 to facilitate stock repurchases up to
$60 million per quarter. Pending the completion of the
proposed merger with VERITAS, we will be subject to a regulatory
limitation that limits the level of quarterly repurchases
allowed.

On March 28, 2005, the Board of Directors increased the
dollar amount of authorized stock repurchases by $3 billion
effective upon completion of the VERITAS merger, without any
specific limit on the number of shares to be repurchased. We
expect to repurchase shares pursuant to this authorization for
cash as business conditions warrant between the date of the
completion of the merger and March 31, 2006. Excluding the
post-merger authorization, as of March 31, 2005,
$475 million remained authorized by our Board of Directors.



Contractual Obligations

The contractual obligations presented in the table below
represent our estimates of future payments under fixed
contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business
needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates, and
other factors may result in actual payments differing from the
estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and
amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the
most significant assumptions used in our information within the
context of our consolidated financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows. The following table summarizes our
fixed contractual obligations and commitments as of

Pending Merger

On December 16, 2004, we announced a definitive agreement
with VERITAS under which we would acquire all of the outstanding
stock of VERITAS in exchange for 1.1242 shares of Symantec
common stock for each outstanding share of VERITAS common stock.
The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions.
Under certain terms specified in the merger agreement, Symantec
or VERITAS may terminate the agreement and as a result either
Symantec or VERITAS may be required to pay a $440 million
termination fee to the other party in certain circumstances.

Development Agreement

During the March 2005 quarter, we entered into a development
agreement in the amount of $22 million in connection with
the refurbishment of a building in Dublin, Ireland. Payment of
this amount is contingent upon the achievement of certain
agreed-upon milestones. As none of these milestones have been
reached as of March 31, 2005, there is no accrual relative
to the $22 million commitment included in our liabilities
on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2005.

Royalties

We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment
and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally
based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of
underlying revenue and has not been included in the table above.
Certain royalty commitments have minimum commitment obligations;
however, as of March 31, 2005 all such obligations are
immaterial.

Indemnification

As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we
indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or
occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at
our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers
all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s
or director’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of
future payments we could be required to make under these
indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have
director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our
exposure and enables us to recover a portion or all of any
future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of
these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable
insurance coverage is minimal.



Newly Adopted And Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
FASB, issued SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based
Payment

, which requires companies to measure and recognize
compensation expense for all stock-based payments at fair value.
SFAS No. 123R is effective for annual periods
beginning after June 15, 2005 and, thus, will be effective
for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We are
currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 123R on
our financial position and results of operations. See

Stock-Based Compensation

in

Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

for information related to the pro forma
effects on our reported net income and net income per share when
applying the fair value recognition provisions of the previous
SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

, to stock-based employee compensation.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets — An Amendment of
APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions

. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the
exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges
of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB
Opinion No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions

, and replaces it with an exception for
exchanges that do not have commercial substance.
SFAS No. 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has
commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are
expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange.
SFAS No. 153 is effective for fiscal periods beginning
after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 153
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In October 2004, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue No., or EITF, 04-1,

Accounting for Preexisting
Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination

,
which provides new guidance for the accounting for preexisting
relationships between the parties to a business combination.
Additionally, EITF 04-1 includes additional disclosure
requirements for business combinations between parties with a
preexisting relationship. EITF 04-1 is effective for fiscal
periods beginning after October 13, 2004. The adoption of
EITF 04-1 did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In June 2004, the FASB issued EITF 02-14,

Whether an
Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to
Investments Other Than Common Stock

. EITF 02-14
addresses whether the equity method of accounting applies when
an investor does not have an investment in voting common stock
of an investee but exercises significant influence through other
means. EITF 02-14 states that an investor should only apply
the equity method of accounting when it has investments in
either common stock or in-substance common stock of a
corporation, provided that the investor has the ability to
exercise significant influence over the operating and financial
policies of the investee. The accounting provisions of
EITF 02-14 are effective for reporting periods beginning
after September 15, 2004. The adoption of EITF 02-14
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF 03-1,

The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments

, which provides new guidance for assessing
impairment losses on investments. Additionally, EITF 03-1
includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are
deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB
delayed the accounting provisions of EITF 03-1; however,
the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods
ending after June 15, 2004. The adoption of the disclosure
provisions of EITF 03-1 did not have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements. We do not expect the
accounting provisions of EITF 03-1 to have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows.

Business Risk Factors

The following risk factors present certain risks relative to
Symantec without giving effect to the proposed merger with
VERITAS. We have provided in the joint proxy
statement/prospectus that was first mailed to our stockholders
on May 23, 2005, under the caption “Risk
Factors — Risks Related to Symantec After the
Merger,” risks that we believe may apply to Symantec and
VERITAS operating as a combined company if the merger is
completed. The joint proxy statement/prospectus is included in
our Registration Statement on Form S-4 which is on file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.



There are numerous risks associated with our recent entry
into an agreement to merge with VERITAS.

On
December 16, 2004 we announced that we had entered into an
agreement to merge with VERITAS in a transaction where VERITAS
would become our wholly-owned subsidiary and the outstanding
shares of VERITAS common stock would convert into the right to
receive shares of our common stock representing approximately
40% of our outstanding shares following the merger. There are
numerous risks associated with our having entered into this
agreement, including the following:

We cannot assure you that all conditions to the merger will
be completed and the merger consummated.

The
merger is subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions,
including the approval of our and VERITAS’ stockholders,
and we cannot assure you that the merger will be completed. In
the event the merger is not completed, we may be subject to many
risks, including the costs related to the proposed merger, such
as legal, accounting, and advisory fees, which must be paid even
if the merger is not completed, or the payment of a large
termination fee to VERITAS under specified circumstances. If the
merger is not completed, the market price of our common stock
could decline.

Completion of the merger may result in dilution of net income
per share.

The completion of the merger may not
result in improved net income per share of Symantec or in a
financial condition superior to that which we would have
achieved on a stand-alone basis. The merger could fail to
produce the benefits that we anticipate, or could have other
adverse effects that we currently do not foresee. In addition,
some of the assumptions that we have relied upon, such as the
achievement of operating synergies, may not be realized. In this
event, the merger could result in a reduction of our net income
per share as compared to the net income per share that we would
have achieved if the merger had not occurred.

If we and VERITAS fail to successfully integrate our
operations, the combined company may not realize the potential
benefits of the merger.

If the merger is
completed, the integration of Symantec and VERITAS will be a
time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our
operations if it is not completed in a timely and efficient
manner. If this integration effort is not successful, our
results of operations could be harmed, employee morale could
decline, key employees could leave, and customers could cancel
existing orders or choose not to place new ones. In addition, we
may not achieve anticipated synergies or other benefits of the
merger. Following the merger, Symantec and VERITAS must operate
as a combined organization utilizing common information and
communication systems, operating procedures, financial controls,
and human resources practices. We may encounter the following
difficulties, costs, and delays involved in integrating these
operations:

If the combined company’s operations after the merger do
not meet the expectations of existing customers of Symantec or
VERITAS, then these customers may cease doing business with the
combined company altogether, which would harm our results of
operations and financial condition.



Costs associated with the merger are difficult to estimate,
may be higher than expected, and may harm the financial results
of the combined company.

We have incurred
substantial direct transaction costs associated with the merger
and additional costs associated with consolidation and
integration of operations and we expect to continue to incur
substantial costs for these purposes. If the total costs of the
merger exceed estimates or the benefits of the merger do not
exceed the total costs of the merger, our financial results
could be adversely affected.

Fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected
the price of our common stock in the past and could affect our
stock price in the future.

Our quarterly financial results
have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly
in the future. If our quarterly financial results or our
predictions of future financial results fail to meet the
expectations of securities analysts and investors, our stock
price could be negatively affected. Any volatility in our
quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to
raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve
issuances of our stock or securities convertible into, or
exercisable for, our stock. You should not rely on the results
of prior periods as predictors of our future performance.

Factors associated with the conduct of our business may cause
fluctuations in our quarterly financial results.

A number of
factors associated with the operation of our business may cause
our quarterly financial results to fluctuate, including our
ability to:

Quarterly changes in our financial results could cause the
trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.

Factors associated with our industry and the markets for our
products may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial
results.

A number of factors associated with our industry
and the markets for our products, many of which are outside our
control, may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate,
including:

Any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of
our common stock to fluctuate significantly.

The timing of orders by customers and channel partners may
cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results.

The
timing and amount of orders by customers and channel partners
and seasonality in the buying patterns of customers may cause
our quarterly results to fluctuate. The risk of quarterly
fluctuations is increased by the fact that a significant portion
of our quarterly net revenues has historically been generated
during the last month of each fiscal quarter. Most resellers
have tended to make a majority of their purchases at the end of
a fiscal quarter. In addition, many enterprise customers
negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter. Due to the
unpredictability of these end-of-period buying patterns,
forecasts may not be achieved, either because expected sales do
not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that
are



less favorable to us. If we do not achieve our forecasted
results for a particular quarterly period, our stock price could
decline significantly.

Accounting charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly
financial results.

Our financial results have been in the
past, and may continue to be in the future, materially affected
by non-cash and other accounting charges, including:

•

Amortization of intangible assets, including acquired product
    rights

•

Stock-based compensation expense

•

Restructuring charges and reversals of those charges

Our proposed merger with VERITAS would result in increases in
the foregoing types of charges. In particular, we expect to
record approximately $3 billion of intangible assets,
including acquired product rights, in connection with the merger
on which we will be required to record future amortization
charges. We also expect to record stock compensation expense
related to the stock options to purchase VERITAS common stock
assumed by us. The foregoing types of accounting charges may
also be incurred in connection with other business acquisitions.
The price of our common stock could decline to the extent that
our financial results are materially affected by the foregoing
accounting charges.

Our markets are competitive and our financial results and
financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable
to anticipate or react to this competition.

Our markets are
competitive. If we are unable to anticipate or react to
competition or if existing or new competitors gain market share,
our sales may decline or be impaired and we may experience a
decline in the prices we can charge for our products, which
could adversely affect our operating results. Our competitive
position depends on several factors, including:

Our competitors include or may include the following:

•

Independent software vendors who may offer products that
    directly compete with our products or bundle their software
    products with software offered by another vendor either directly
    or as part of a hardware appliance

•

Large operating system providers and network equipment and
    computer hardware manufacturers who may include security, remote
    access, or virus protection tools in their product offerings

•

ISPs that provide security functionality to their subscribers at
    no additional fee

Microsoft has added security and remote access features to new
versions of its operating system products. In addition,
Microsoft has recently announced the acquisition of companies
that offer security products that compete more directly with our
security products. Microsoft’s recent acquisitions include
a provider of server-based antivirus, antispam, and content
filtering products, and a provider of antispyware and other
Internet security products. In addition, Microsoft has recently
announced and has launched the internal testing of an online
suite that includes automated protection, maintenance, and
performance tuning. This consumer subscription service, Windows
OneCare, is expected to be a fee-based service available to the
general public by the end of calendar 2005. Microsoft has also
recently introduced a free antispyware product for the consumer
market. In the future, Microsoft may offer additional security
features or products that compete with our security products.



Many of our strategic partners offer software products, and
customers may prefer to purchase software and hardware that is
produced by the same vendor. In addition, these vendors may
choose not to offer our products to their customers or to limit
our access to their hardware platforms. Similarly, some software
vendors may choose to bundle their software with their own or
other vendors’ software or may limit our access to standard
product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products
for their platform.

Several of our current and potential competitors have greater
financial, technical, sales, marketing, and other resources than
we do and consequently may have an ability to influence
customers to purchase their products instead of ours. Our future
and existing competitors could introduce products with superior
features, scalability, and functionality at lower prices than
our products, and could also bundle existing or new products
with other more established products in order to compete with
us. Our competitors could also gain market share by acquiring or
forming strategic alliances with our other competitors and ISPs
such as AOL and Comcast. In addition, because new distribution
methods offered by the Internet and electronic commerce have
removed many of the barriers to entry historically faced by
start-up companies in the software industry, we may face
additional sources of competition in the future. If we do not
adapt our business in the face of this competition, our business
and operating results may be harmed.

Because we derive a majority of our license revenues from
sales of a few product lines, any decline in demand for these
products could severely harm our ability to generate
revenues.

We derive a majority of our revenues from a
limited number of software products, including our antivirus and
Internet security products. In addition, our software products
are concentrated within the markets for data security. Net
revenues from sale of our antivirus products within our Consumer
Products and Enterprise Security segments represented 51%, 55%,
and 51% of our total net revenues for fiscal 2005, 2004, and
2003, respectively. Net revenues from sales of our Norton
Internet Security product within our Consumer Products segment
represented 18%, 12%, and 7% of our total net revenues during
fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. As a result, we are
particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in demand for these
products, whether as a result of competition, product
obsolescence, technological change, budget constraints of our
potential customers, or other factors. If our revenues derived
from these software products were to decline significantly, our
business and operating results would be adversely affected.

There is uncertainty as to whether or not we will be able to
sustain the growth rates in sales of our products, particularly
our consumer security products.

Over the last several
quarters, we have experienced a higher than expected rate of
growth in sales of our consumer security protection products,
and we expect that we will not be able to sustain this high
growth rate on a consistent basis. We believe that consumer
security protection sales have been spurred by a number of
factors, including increased broadband usage and increased
awareness of security threats to consumer systems, including
several well publicized viruses. The impact of these factors may
diminish over time with greater market penetration, and it is
possible that our growth rates in sales of consumer security
protection products may decline.

If we are unable to develop new and enhanced products that
achieve widespread market acceptance, we may be unable to
recover product development costs, and our earnings and revenues
may decline.

Our future success depends on our ability to
address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by
developing and introducing new products, product upgrades, and
services on a timely basis. We have incurred, and we will need
to continue to incur, significant research and development
expenditures in future periods as we strive to remain
competitive. New product development and introduction involve a
significant commitment of time and resources and are subject to
a number of risks and challenges, including:



If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges,
or if our new product introductions are not technologically
competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, we will have
expended substantial resources and capital without realizing
sufficient revenues in return, and our business and operating
results could be adversely affected.

We have grown, and may continue to grow, through acquisitions
that give rise to risks and challenges that could adversely
affect our future financial results.

We have in the past
acquired, and we expect in the future to acquire, other
businesses, business units, and technologies. Acquisitions
involve a number of special risks and challenges, including:

Integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be
a complex, time consuming, and expensive process. To integrate
acquired businesses, we must implement our technology systems in
the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel
of the acquired operations. Our success in completing the
integration of acquired businesses may impact the market
acceptance of such acquisitions, and our willingness to acquire
additional businesses in the future. Other challenges of
integration include our ability to incorporate acquired products
and business technology into our existing product lines,
including consolidating technology with duplicative
functionality or designed on a different technological
architecture, and our ability to sell the acquired products
through our existing or acquired sales channels. We also must
effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired
business organizations into our own in a way that aligns common
interests. Further, the difficulties of integrating acquired
businesses could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our
management focus from other opportunities and challenges, and
increase our expenses and working capital requirements.

Any of the foregoing and other factors could harm our ability to
achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired
businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of
acquisitions. We may face difficulties in entering markets in
which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where
competitors in such markets have stronger market positions.
Mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are
inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our
previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not
materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or
financial condition.



We have authorized the use of a substantial amount of our
cash for the repurchase of our shares, and this use of funds may
limit our ability to complete other transactions or to pursue
other business initiatives.

In March 2005, our board of
directors approved the expansion of our previously authorized
share repurchase program by authorizing an additional
$3 billion of cash to be used for this purpose following
completion of our merger with VERITAS. With this increase, we
have approximately $3.5 billion of funding authorized for
the repurchase of shares under this program. We expect to
repurchase shares for cash as business conditions warrant
between the date of the completion of the merger and the end of
our fiscal year 2006, which ends on March 31, 2006. The
full implementation of this repurchase program will use a
significant portion of our cash reserves. This use of cash could
limit our future flexibility to complete acquisitions of
businesses or technology or other transactions or make
investments in research and development, new employee hiring, or
other aspects of our operations that might be in our best
interests, or could require that we borrow money or issue
additional equity securities for such purposes. Any incurrence
of debt may not be on terms favorable to us and could result in
our being subject to covenants or other contractual restrictions
that limit our ability to take advantage of other opportunities
that may arise. Any such incurrence of debt would likely
increase our interest expense, and any issuance of additional
equity securities would dilute the stock ownership of existing
stockholders. We have in the past repurchased shares under our
repurchase program at prices that are higher than the current
trading prices of our common stock, and the prices at which we
repurchase shares under the expanded repurchase program may
exceed the prices at which our shares trade following such
repurchases.

Our international operations involve special risks that could
increase our expenses, adversely affect our operating results,
and require increased time and attention of our management.

We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers
located outside of the U.S. and we have significant operations
outside of the U.S., including engineering, sales, customer
support, and production operations. We plan to expand our
international operations, but such expansion is contingent upon
the financial performance of our existing international
operations as well as our identification of growth
opportunities. Our international operations are subject to risks
in addition to those faced by our domestic operations, including:



•

Political unrest, war, or terrorism, particularly in areas in
    which we have facilities

A significant portion of our transactions outside of the
U.S. are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly,
our future operating results will continue to be subject to
fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Although we hedge
against our foreign currency exposure, hedging foreign currency
transaction exposures is complex and subject to uncertainty. We
may be negatively affected by fluctuations in foreign currency
rates in the future, especially if international sales continue
to grow as a percentage of our total sales.

We receive significant tax benefits from sales to our
non-U.S. customers. These benefits are contingent upon
existing tax regulations in both the U.S. and in the countries
in which our international operations are located. Future
changes in domestic or international tax regulations could
adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax
benefits.

If we lose key personnel or fail to integrate replacement
personnel successfully, our ability to manage our business could
be impaired.

Our future success depends upon the continued
service of our key management, technical, sales, and other
critical personnel. Our officers and other key personnel are
employees-at-will, and we cannot assure you that we will be able
to retain them. Key personnel have left our company in the past
and there likely will be additional departures of key personnel
from time to time in the future. The loss of any key employee
could result in significant disruptions to our operations,
including adversely affecting the timeliness of product
releases, the successful implementation and completion of
company initiatives, and the results of our operations. In
addition, the integration of replacement personnel could be time
consuming, may cause additional disruptions to our operations,
and may be unsuccessful.

If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees
and manage our employee base effectively, we may be unable to
develop new and enhanced products, effectively manage or expand
our business, or increase our revenues.

Our future success
depends upon our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled
management, sales, marketing, financial, and technical
personnel. However, competition for people with the specific
skills that we require is significant. In order to attract and
retain personnel in a competitive marketplace, we believe that
we must provide a competitive compensation package, including
cash and equity-based compensation. The volatility in our stock
price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to
retain or attract employees. In addition, we may be unable to
obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the
number of shares available for issuance under our equity
compensation plans and recent changes in accounting rules will
require us to treat the issuance of employee stock options and
other forms of equity-based compensation as compensation
expense, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. As a
result, we may decide to issue fewer stock options and may be
impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary
personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified
employees, or conversely, if we fail to manage employee
performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market
conditions, our business and operating results could be
adversely affected.

If we fail to manage our distribution channels effectively,
or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to
their customers, our operating results could be adversely
affected.

We sell our consumer products to individuals and
small offices/home offices around the world through a
multi-tiered distribution network. Our products are available to
customers through indirect channels that include distributors,
retailers, direct marketers, Internet-based resellers,
educational institutions, and ISPs, as well as through OEMs. We
separately sell annual content update subscriptions directly to
end users primarily via the Internet. We also sell some of our
products and product upgrades through direct mail/email and over
the Internet, in conjunction with channel partners.

Indirect Sales Channels.

A significant portion
of our revenues are derived from sales through indirect
channels, including distributors that sell our products to
end-users and other resellers. This channel involves a number of
special risks, including:

•

Our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products
    to end-users

•

Our resellers and distributors are not subject to minimum sales
    requirements or any obligation to market our products to their
    customers



•

Our reseller and distributor agreements are generally
    nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause

•

Our resellers and distributors may market and distribute
    competing products, in part due to pricing, terms, and
    promotions offered by our competitors and other factors that we
    do not control and cannot predict

OEM Sales Channels.

A significant portion of
our revenues are derived from sales through our OEM partners
that incorporate our products into, or bundle our products with,
their products. Our reliance on this sales channel involves many
risks, including:

If we fail to manage our distribution channels successfully, our
distribution channels may conflict with one another or otherwise
fail to perform as we anticipate, which could reduce our sales
and increase our expenses, as well as weaken our competitive
position. Some distribution partners have experienced financial
difficulties in the past, and if our partners suffer financial
difficulties in the future, we may have reduced sales or
increased bad debt expense, which would adversely affect our
operating results. In addition, reliance on multiple channels
subjects us to events that cause unpredictability in demand.
This increases the risk that we may not plan effectively for the
future, which could result in adverse operating results in
future periods.

Increased reliance on sales of enterprise licenses may result
in greater fluctuations in, or otherwise adversely affect, our
financial results.

Sales of enterprise licenses through our
Enterprise Security segment represent a major portion of our
business. Enterprise licensing arrangements involve a longer
sales cycle than sales through other distribution channels,
require greater investment of resources in establishing the
enterprise relationship, may involve greater pricing pressure,
and sometimes result in lower operating margins. The timing of
the execution of volume licenses, or their non-renewal by large
customers, could cause our results of operations to vary
significantly from quarter to quarter and could have a material
adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, longer
license periods impede our ability to increase prices due to
increased costs and may adversely impact our operating margins.

A significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales by
our direct sales force to enterprise customers. There is a
substantial amount of training required for sales
representatives to become productive and that training must be
updated to cover new and revised products. If we are unable to
maintain an adequate direct sales force, it could have a
material adverse impact on our sales and results of operations.

Third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary
rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and
prevent us from selling our products.

From time to time, we
have received claims that we have



infringed the intellectual property rights of others. As the
number of products in the software industry increases and the
functionality of these products further overlap, we believe that
we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims,
including patent, copyright, and trademark infringement claims.
We have received several trademark claims in the past and may
receive more claims in the future from third parties who may
also be using our name or another name that may be similar to
one of our trademarks or service marks. We have also received
patent infringement claims in the past and may receive more
claims in the future based on allegations that our products
infringe upon patents held by third parties. In addition, former
employers of our former, current, or future employees may assert
claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the
confidential or proprietary information of these former
employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could:

In addition, we license and use software from third parties in
our business. These third party software licenses may not
continue to be available to us on acceptable terms. Also, these
third parties may from time to time receive claims that they
have infringed the intellectual property rights of others,
including patent and copyright infringement claims, which may
affect our ability to continue licensing their software. Our
inability to use any of this third party software could result
in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business, which
could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

If we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent
third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and
technology, our financial results could be harmed.

Our
software and underlying technology are proprietary. We seek to
protect our proprietary rights through a combination of
confidentiality agreements and procedures and copyright, patent,
trademark, and trade secret laws. However, all of these measures
afford only limited protection and may be challenged,
invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. Third parties may
copy aspects of our products or otherwise obtain and use our
proprietary information without authorization. Third parties may
also develop similar or superior technology independently,
including by designing around our patents. Our shrink-wrap
license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may
be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions.
Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the
same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws
of the United States, and we may be subject to unauthorized use
of our products in those countries. Any legal action that we may
bring to protect proprietary information could be expensive and
may distract management from day-to-day operations. Unauthorized
copying or use of our products or proprietary information could
result in reduced sales of our products.

Although we are unable to quantify the extent of piracy of our
software products, software piracy may depress our net revenues.
While this would adversely affect revenues domestically, lost
revenues are believed to be even more significant outside of the
United States, particularly in countries where laws are less
protective of intellectual property rights. We engage in efforts
to educate consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine
products and to educate lawmakers on the advantages of a
business climate where intellectual property rights are
protected, and we cooperate with the Business Software Alliance
and the Software & Information Industry Association in
their efforts to combat piracy. However, these efforts may not
affect the piracy of our products.

Our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of
computer configurations, which could result in errors or product
failures.

Because we offer very complex products, undetected
errors, failures, or bugs may occur, especially when the
products are first introduced or when new versions are released.
Our products often are installed and used in large-scale
computing environments with different operating systems, system
management software, and equipment and networking
configurations, which may cause errors or failures in



our products or may expose undetected errors, failures, or bugs
in our products. Our customers’ computer environments are
often characterized by a wide variety of standard and
non-standard configurations that make pre-release testing for
programming or compatibility errors very difficult and
time-consuming. In addition, despite testing by us and by
others, errors, failures, or bugs may not be found in new
products or releases until after commencement of commercial
shipments. In the past, we have discovered software errors,
failures, and bugs in certain of our product offerings after
their introduction and have experienced delayed or lost revenues
during the period required to correct these errors.

Errors, failures, or bugs in products released by us could
result in negative publicity, product returns, loss of or delay
in market acceptance of our products, loss of competitive
position, or claims by customers or others. Many of our end-user
customers use our products in applications that are critical to
their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects
in our products than to defects in other less critical software
products. In addition, if an actual or perceived breach of
information integrity or availability occurs in one of our
end-user customer’s systems, regardless of whether the
breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of
the effectiveness of our products could be harmed. Alleviating
any of these problems could require significant expenditures of
our capital and resources and could cause interruptions, delays,
or cessation of our product licensing, which could cause us to
lose existing or potential customers and would adversely affect
our operating results.

Most of our license agreements with customers contain provisions
designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability
claims. It is possible, however, that a court could rule that
these provisions are unenforceable. If a customer is successful
in proving its damages and a court does not enforce our
protective provisions, it could prove expensive and
time-consuming to defend against these claims, and we could be
liable for the damages suffered by our customers and other
related expenses, which could adversely affect our operating
results.

Increased customer demands on our technical support services
may adversely affect our financial results.

We offer
technical support services with many of our products. We may be
unable to respond quickly enough to short-term increases in
customer demand for support services. We also may be unable to
modify the format of our support services to compete with
changes in support services provided by competitors or
successfully integrate support for our customers. Further
customer demand for these services, without corresponding
revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our
operating results.

We have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide
consumer support functions. As such, we are highly dependent on
the on-going business success of the companies with whom we have
contracted to provide these services. If these companies
experience financial difficulties, do not maintain sufficiently
skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts or
otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these
contracts, the level of support services to our customers may be
significantly disrupted, which could materially harm our
relationships with these customers.

Our inability to timely distribute our products and services
over the Internet, including security patches and content
updates, could adversely affect our business.

Our ability to
maintain and increase the speed with which we provide services
to customers and to increase the scope of these services is
limited by and dependent upon the speed and reliability of the
Internet. We are increasingly reliant on the Internet as a means
to distribute our security patches and content updates to our
customers. Accordingly, if we, or our customers, are unable to
utilize the Internet due to a failure of technology or
infrastructure, terrorist activity, or other reasons, our
ability to provide services may suffer, which could lead to a
decrease in revenues.

Our software products and Web site may be subject to
intentional disruption, which could adversely impact our
reputation and future sales.

Although we believe we have
sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions,
we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically
designed to impede the performance of our products. Similarly,
experienced computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our
network security or the security of our Web site and
misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of
our services. Because the techniques used by such computer
programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and
may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be



unable to anticipate these techniques. Our activities could be
adversely affected, and our reputation and future sales harmed,
if these intentionally disruptive efforts are successful.

Our stock price may be volatile in the future, and you could
lose the value of your investment.

The market price of our
common stock has experienced significant fluctuations in the
past and may continue to fluctuate in the future, and as a
result you could lose the value of your investment. The market
price of our common stock may be affected by a number of
factors, including:

The stock market in general, and the market prices of stocks of
technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme
price volatility, which has adversely affected and may continue
to adversely affect the market price of our common stock for
reasons unrelated to our business or operating results.

Factors outside of our control may adversely affect our
operations and operating results.

Our operations and
operating results may be adversely affected by many different
factors which are outside of our control, including:

•

Earthquakes, floods, or other natural disasters affecting our
    headquarters located in Silicon Valley, California, an area
    known for seismic activity, or our other locations worldwide

•

Acts of war or terrorism

•

Malicious software programs, such as viruses and worms, or
    security breaches

Any of these factors could result in a loss of revenues and/or
higher expenses, which could adversely affect our financial
results.

If the carrying value of our long-lived assets is not
recoverable, an impairment loss must be recognized which would
adversely affect our financial results.

We will evaluate our
long-lived assets, including property and equipment, goodwill,
acquired product rights, and other intangible assets, whenever
events or circumstances occur which indicate that these assets
might be impaired. For example, we estimate that we will record
approximately $9 billion of goodwill as a result of our
merger with VERITAS and may record additional



goodwill in connection with future acquisitions. Goodwill is
evaluated annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each
fiscal year, regardless of events and circumstances. We will
continue to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount
of our long-lived assets, and we may incur substantial
impairment charges, which could adversely affect our financial
results.

Our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate, which could
increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income.

Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several
factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:

Item 7A:

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
    Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in market
prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates. We
use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these
risks. All financial instruments used are in accordance with our
global investment policy and global foreign exchange policy. We
do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

We also hold equity interests in several privately-held
companies. These investments were recorded at cost, and are
classified as other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. These investments are inherently risky and we could lose
our entire investment in these companies. As of March 31,
2005, these investments had an aggregate carrying value of
$11 million.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

We consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased
with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash
equivalents. All of our cash equivalents and short-term
investments are classified as available-for-sale securities as
of the balance sheet dates. Our available-for-sale securities
are reported at fair market value and any unrealized gains and
losses are included as a component in Stockholders’ Equity
in Accumulated other comprehensive income on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments
consist primarily of corporate securities, taxable auction rate
securities, U.S. government and government-sponsored securities,
and money market funds. The following table presents the fair
value and hypothetical changes in fair market values of our
significant financial instruments held as of March 31, 2005
that are sensitive to changes in interest rates (in millions):

The modeling technique used above measures the change in fair

rates. Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel
shifts in the yield curve of minus 75 basis points, minus
25 basis points, plus 50 basis points, plus
100 basis points, and plus 150 basis points, which are
representative of potential movements in the United States
Federal Funds Rate and the Euro Area ECB Rate.



Exchange Rate Sensitivity

We conduct business in 31 international currencies through our
worldwide operations. We believe that the use of foreign
exchange forward contracts should reduce the risks that arise
from conducting business in international markets.

We hedge risks associated with certain foreign currency cash,
investments, receivables, and payables in order to minimize the
impact of changes in foreign currency fluctuations on these
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
Foreign exchange forward contracts as of March 31, 2005
were as follows (in millions):

We believe that these foreign exchange forward contracts do not
subject us to undue risk from the movement of foreign exchange
rates because gains and losses on these contracts are offset by
losses and gains on the underlying assets and liabilities. All
contracts have a maturity of no more than 35 days. Gains
and losses are accounted for as Interest and other income, net
each period. We regularly review our hedging program and may
make changes as a result of this review.

Item 9:

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on
    Accounting and Financial Disclosure

We have had no disagreements with our accountants on any
accounting or financial disclosures.

Item 9A:

Controls and Procedures

Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, defines the term
“disclosure controls and procedures” to mean a
company’s controls and other procedures that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer have concluded, based on the evaluation of the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures by our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as of the end of the
period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective for this purpose.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission, or COSO. Based on our evaluation under the framework
in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

, our
management has concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2005. Our
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,
2005 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is
included herein.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors
and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that



the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within Symantec have been detected.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Symantec Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
March 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended
March 31, 2005. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) for
each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31,
2005. These consolidated financial statements and schedule are
the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Symantec Corporation and subsidiaries as of
March 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended March 31, 2005, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule for each of
the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2005,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
of Symantec Corporation as of March 31, 2005, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
dated June 15, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of,
internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Symantec Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A,

that
Symantec Corporation maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2005, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Management of
Symantec Corporation is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness
of the internal control over financial reporting of Symantec
Corporation based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Symantec
Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of March 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by COSO.
Also, in our opinion, Symantec Corporation maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of March 31, 2005, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Symantec Corporation and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity,
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended March 31, 2005, and our report dated June 15,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements.

SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Symantec Corporation (“we,” “us,” and
“our” refer to Symantec Corporation and all of its
subsidiaries) is the global leader in information security
providing a broad range of software, appliances, and services
designed to help individuals, small and mid-sized businesses,
and large enterprises secure and manage their information
technology, or IT, infrastructure. Symantec’s Norton brand
of products is the worldwide leader in consumer security and
problem-solving solutions. Founded in 1982, we have offices in
38 countries worldwide.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Symantec Corporation and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

During the three years ended March 31, 2005, we acquired
the following businesses:

Each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase and,
accordingly, their operating results have been included in our
consolidated financial statements since their respective dates
of acquisition. In August 2001, we sold assets and transferred
liabilities and employees related to our Web Access Management
product line to PassGo Technologies, Ltd. and agreed to license
the related technology to them for a period of four years
through August 2005. In December 1999, we licensed substantially
all of the ACT! Product line technology to Interact Commerce
Corporation for a period of four years through December 2003.

See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion.

Fiscal Years

We have a 52/53-week fiscal accounting year. Accordingly, all
references as of and for the periods ended March 31, 2005,
2004, and 2003 reflect amounts as of and for the periods ended
April 1, 2005, April 2, 2004, and March 28, 2003,
respectively. The fiscal accounting years ended April 1,
2005 and March 28, 2003 are each comprised of 52 weeks
of operations, while the fiscal accounting year ended
April 2, 2004 is comprised of 53 weeks of operations.
The fiscal accounting year ending March 31, 2006 will
comprise 52 weeks of operations.

Symantec share and per share amounts in the Consolidated
Statements of Income and the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements retroactively reflect the two-for-one stock splits
effected as stock dividends, which occurred on November 30,
2004 and November 19, 2003.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies — (Continued)

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally
the local currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate on the
balance sheet dates. The translation adjustments resulting from
this process are included as a component of stockholders’
equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. Revenues and
expenses are translated using average exchange rates prevailing
during the year. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses
are included in the determination of net income. Deferred tax
assets (liabilities) are established on the cumulative
translation adjustment attributable to unremitted foreign
earnings that are not intended to be indefinitely reinvested.

Revenue Recognition

We derive revenue primarily from sales of packaged products,
perpetual license agreements, product maintenance, and services,
and recognize this revenue when the following conditions have
been met:

We sell packaged software products through a multi-tiered
distribution channel. We also sell electronic download and
packaged products via the Internet. We separately sell annual
content update subscriptions directly to end-users primarily via
the Internet. We do not recognize package product revenue on
distribution and reseller channel inventory in excess of
specified inventory levels in these channels. We defer the
portion of revenue from package and electronic download products
related to content updates. Revenue related to content updates
is deferred and recognized ratably over the year that such
updates are provided. We offer the right of return of our
products under various policies and programs with our
distributors, resellers, and end-user customers. We estimate and
record reserves for end-user product returns as an offset to
revenue.

We offer channel and end-user rebates for products within our
Enterprise Security, Enterprise Administration, and Consumer
Products segments. Our estimated reserves for channel volume
incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and
resellers’ actual performance against the terms and
conditions of volume incentive rebate programs, which are
typically entered into quarterly. Our reserves for end-user
rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the
promotional program, actual sales during the promotion, amount
of actual redemptions received, historical redemption trends by
product and by type of promotional program, and the value of the
rebate. We estimate and record reserves for channel and end-user
rebates, and we account for these reserves as an offset to
revenue.

We enter into perpetual software license agreements through
direct sales to customers and indirect sales with distributors
and resellers. The license agreements generally include product
maintenance agreements, for which the related revenue is
deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the
agreements.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies — (Continued)

Our services include managed security services, consulting, and
education. We recognize managed security services revenue
ratably over the period that such contracted services are
provided. We recognize consulting services revenue as services
are performed or upon written acceptance from customers, if
applicable. We recognize education services revenue as services
are performed.

In arrangements that include multiple elements, including
perpetual software licenses and maintenance and/or services and
packaged products with content updates, we allocate and defer
revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor-specific
objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the undelivered
elements, and recognize the difference between the total
arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered
items as revenue. Our deferred revenue consists primarily of the
unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance and
consumer product content updates.

VSOE of each element is based on the price for which the
undelivered element is sold separately. We determine fair value
of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our
stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties. When VSOE
does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance, then
the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the
performance period.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

We consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased
with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash
equivalents. Our short-term investments, classified as
available-for-sale as of the respective balance sheet dates, are
reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of
tax, included in Accumulated other comprehensive income within
Stockholders’ Equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be
other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are
included in Interest and other income, net in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based upon
the specific identification method.

Trade Accounts Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
and are not interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for
doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible trade
receivables. We also review our trade receivables by aging
category to identify specific customers with known disputes or
collectibility issues. We exercise judgment when determining the
adequacy of these reserves as we evaluate historical bad debt
trends, general economic conditions in the United States and
internationally, and changes in customer financial conditions.

Equity Investments

We have equity investments in privately held companies for
business and strategic purposes. These investments are included
in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
are accounted for under the cost method as we do not have
significant influence over these investees. Each quarter we
assess our compliance with accounting guidance, including the
provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No., or FIN, 46R,

Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities-An Interpretation of ARB
No. 51

, and any impairment issues. Under the cost
method, the investment is recorded at its initial cost and is
periodically reviewed for impairment. Under FIN 46R, we
must consolidate a variable interest entity if we have a
variable interest (or combination of variable interests) in the
entity that will absorb a majority of the entity’s expected
losses, receive a majority of the entity’s expected
residual returns, or both. Currently, our equity investments are
not subject to consolidation under FIN 46R as we do not
have significant influence over these investees and we do not
receive a majority of the returns. During our review for
impairment, we examine the investees’ actual and forecasted
operating results, financial position, and liquidity, as well as
business/industry factors in assessing whether a decline in
value of an equity investment has occurred that is other than
temporary. When such a decline in value is identified, the fair
value of the equity investment is estimated



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies — (Continued)

based on the preceding factors and an impairment loss is
recognized in Interest and other income, net in the Consolidated
Statements of Income.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We utilize some natural hedging to mitigate our foreign currency
exposures and we manage certain residual exposures through the
use of one-month forward foreign exchange contracts. We enter
into forward foreign exchange contracts with high-quality
financial institutions primarily to minimize currency exchange
risks associated with certain balance sheet positions
denominated in foreign currencies. We do not utilize derivative
instruments for trading purposes. Gains and losses on the
contracts are included in Interest and other income, net in the
Consolidated Statements of Income in the period that gains and
losses on the underlying transactions are recognized. The gains
and losses on the contracts generally offset the gains and
losses on the underlying transactions. The fair value of forward
foreign exchange contracts approximates cost due to the short
maturity periods. As of March 31, 2005, the notional amount
of our forward exchange contracts was $153 million, all of
which matures in 35 days or less. We do not hedge our foreign
currency translation risk.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
principally determined using currently adjusted standards, which
approximate actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis.
Inventory consists of raw materials and finished goods.

Property, Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements

Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements are stated at
cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation and amortization is provided on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets
as follows:

Acquired Product Rights

Acquired product rights are comprised of purchased product
rights, technologies, databases and revenue-related order
backlog, and contracts from acquired companies. Acquired product
rights are stated at cost less accumulated amortization.
Amortization of acquired product rights is provided on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
respective assets, generally one to five years, and is included
in Cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or
SFAS, No. 142.,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and
identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be
tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives
be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and
reviewed for impairment in accordance with
SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

We test goodwill
annually for impairment or more frequently if events and
circumstances warrant.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies — (Continued)

Long-Lived Assets

We account for long-lived assets in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, which requires that long-lived and
intangible assets, including property, equipment, leasehold
improvements, and acquired product rights, be evaluated for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We
would recognize an impairment loss when the sum of the
undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the
use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its
carrying amount. Such impairment loss would be measured as the
difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair
value. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in
the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying
amount or fair value less costs to sell, and no longer
depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group
classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the
appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and
liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences
of temporary differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and
liabilities, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We also
account for any income tax contingencies in accordance with
SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies.

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the periods.
Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding and potentially
dilutive common shares outstanding during the periods.
Potentially dilutive common shares include the assumed exercise
of stock options using the treasury stock method and conversion
of debt, if dilutive in the period. Potentially dilutive common
shares are excluded in net loss periods, as their effect would
be antidilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation awards to employees
using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board, or APB, No. 25,

Accounting for
Stock-Issued to Employees

and to non-employees using the
fair value method in accordance with SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

. In addition, we
apply applicable provisions of FIN 44,

Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation

,

an
interpretation of APB No. 25

. Our stock plans are
described in Note 11. Under APB No. 25, because the
exercise price of our employee stock options generally equals
the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant,
no compensation expense is recognized in our consolidated
financial statements.



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies — (Continued)

Pro forma information regarding net income and net income per
share is required by SFAS No. 123. This information is
required to be determined as if we had accounted for our
employee stock options, including shares issued under the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, collectively called options,
granted subsequent to March 31, 1995 under the fair value
method of that statement. The following table illustrates the
effect on net income and net income per share as if we had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation for
each of the three years ended March 31, 2005, 2004, and
2003:

The fair value of options granted during fiscal 2005, 2004, and
2003 reported below has been estimated at the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model assuming no
expected dividends and the following weighted average
assumptions:

The weighted average estimated fair values of employee stock
options granted during fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $15.46,
$8.73, and $5.59 per share, respectively. The weighted
average estimated fair value of employee stock purchase rights
granted under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during fiscal
2005, 2004, and 2003 were $8.19, $4.36, and $3.37, respectively.

For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value
of the options was amortized to expense using the straight-line
method over the options’ vesting period for employee stock
options, and over the six-month purchase period for stock
purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Our product revenues are concentrated in the software industry,
which is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant
technological changes in the industry or customer requirements,
or the emergence of competitive products with new capabilities
or technologies, could adversely affect our operating results.
In addition, a significant portion of our revenues and net
income is derived from international sales and independent
agents and distributors. Fluctuations of the United States
dollar against foreign currencies,



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies — (Continued)

changes in local regulatory or economic conditions, piracy, or
nonperformance by independent agents or distributors could
adversely affect operating results.

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash
equivalents, short-term investments, and trade accounts
receivable. Our investment portfolio is diversified and consists
of investment grade securities. Our investment policy limits the
amount of credit risk exposure to any one issuer and in any one
country. We are exposed to credit risks in the event of default
by the issuers to the extent of the amount recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The credit risk in our trade
accounts receivable is substantially mitigated by our credit
evaluation process, reasonably short collection terms, and the
geographical dispersion of sales transactions. We maintain
reserves for potential credit losses and such losses have been
within management’s expectations.

Legal Expenses

We accrue estimated legal expenses when the likelihood of the
incurrence of the related costs is probable and management has
the ability to estimate such costs. If both of these conditions
are not met, management records the related legal expenses when
incurred. Amounts accrued by us are not discounted. The material
assumptions used to estimate the amount of legal expenses
include:

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

We report comprehensive income or loss in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 130,

Reporting Comprehensive
Income

, which establishes standards for reporting
comprehensive income and its components in the financial
statements. The components of other comprehensive income (loss)
consist of unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities,
net of tax, and foreign currency translation adjustments, net of
tax. Unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale
securities are immaterial for all periods presented.
Comprehensive income is presented in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity.

Newly Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
FASB, issued SFAS No. 123R,

Share-Based
Payment

, which requires companies to measure and recognize
compensation expense for all stock-based payments at fair value.
SFAS No. 123R is effective for annual periods
beginning after June 15, 2005 and, thus, will be effective
for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We are
currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 123R on
our financial position and results of operations. See

Stock-Based Compensation

above for information related to
the pro forma effects on our reported net income and net income
per share when applying the fair value recognition provisions of
the previous SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee
compensation.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets — An Amendment of
APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions

. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the
exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges
of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB
Opinion No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions

, and replaces it with an exception for
exchanges that do not have commercial substance.
SFAS No. 153 specifies that a nonmonetary



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies — (Continued)

exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of
the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of
the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of
SFAS No. 153 did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.

In October 2004, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue No., or EITF, 04-1,

Accounting for Preexisting
Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination

,
which provides new guidance for the accounting for preexisting
relationships between the parties to a business combination.
EITF 04-1 also includes additional disclosure requirements
for business combinations between parties with a preexisting
relationship. EITF 04-1 is effective for fiscal periods
beginning after October 13, 2004. The adoption of
EITF 04-1 did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.

In June 2004, the FASB issued EITF 02-14,

Whether an
Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to
Investments Other Than Common Stock

. EITF 02-14
addresses whether the equity method of accounting applies when
an investor does not have an investment in voting common stock
of an investee but exercises significant influence through other
means. EITF 02-14 states that an investor should only apply
the equity method of accounting when it has investments in
either common stock or in-substance common stock of a
corporation, provided that the investor has the ability to
exercise significant influence over the operating and financial
policies of the investee. The accounting provisions of
EITF 02-14 are effective for reporting periods beginning
after September 15, 2004. The adoption of EITF 02-14
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF 03-1,

The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments

, which provides new guidance for assessing
impairment losses on investments. Additionally, EITF 03-1
includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are
deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB
delayed the accounting provisions of EITF 03-1; however,
the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods
ending after June 15, 2004. The adoption of the disclosure
provisions of EITF 03-1 did not have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements. We do not expect the
accounting provisions of EITF 03-1 to have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows.

Acquisitions

Fiscal 2005 Acquisitions

During fiscal 2005, we acquired five privately-held companies
for a total of $439 million in cash, including
acquisition-related expenses resulting from financial advisory,
legal and accounting services, duplicate sites, and severance
costs, and assumed stock options valued at $1 million.
Approximately $1 million of acquisition-related expenses
remains as an accrual as of March 31, 2005. We recorded
goodwill in connection with each of these acquisitions. In each
acquisition, goodwill resulted primarily from our expectation of
synergies from the integration of the acquired company’s
technology with our technology and the acquired company’s
access to our global distribution network. In addition, each
acquired company provided a knowledgeable and experienced
workforce. The results of operations of the acquired companies
have been included in our operations from the dates of
acquisition. Brightmail Incorporated, TurnTide, Inc., and
Platform Logic, Inc. are included in our Enterprise Security
segment and @stake, Inc. and LIRIC Associates are included in
our Services

segment. For details of the purchase price allocations related
to Brightmail, refer to Table 3.1 below. For details of the
purchase price allocations related to our other fiscal 2005
acquisitions, refer to Table 3.2 below. Our fiscal 2005
acquisitions were considered insignificant for pro forma
financial disclosure, both individually and in the aggregate.

Brightmail Incorporated

On June 21, 2004, we acquired Brightmail, a developer of
email services and software for application service providers,
Internet service providers, portals, and enterprises, for
$317 million in cash, including $2 million of
acquisition-related expenses, and assumed stock options valued
at $1 million. We expect the acquisition to strengthen our
competitive position in the enterprise security market by
allowing us to provide integrated antispam and antivirus
solutions and by enabling the building of a leading gateway
security solution.

The purchase was completed through a step-acquisition, where
prior to the acquisition we owned a 13% equity investment
in Brightmail that we purchased in fiscal 2001. Through the
merger agreement, we purchased the remaining 87% of Brightmail.
The consideration paid pursuant to the merger agreement was
based upon a negotiated value of $370 million, which was
allocated to the Brightmail security holders as follows:
(1) Brightmail shareholders (including Symantec) received a
pro rata amount of cash, (2) holders of vested Brightmail
stock options received a pro rata amount of cash less their
exercise price, and (3) holders of unvested Brightmail
stock options received Symantec unvested stock options. Our
purchase price is less than the $370 million negotiated
value per the merger agreement due to the step-acquisition
structure and the accounting for the assumed unvested stock
options. For details of the purchase price allocation, refer to
Table 3.1.

Brightmail Stock

The net book value of our original 13% equity ownership in
Brightmail was $5 million as of the acquisition date. We
paid $261 million in cash to purchase the remaining 87% of
Brightmail stock not owned by us. The total amount of
$266 million represents the purchase price consideration
for 100% of the Brightmail stock.

Vested Brightmail Stock Options

We paid $49 million to holders of vested options to
purchase Brightmail stock, representing the intrinsic value of
those options as defined by the merger agreement.

Unvested Brightmail Stock Options

We assumed unvested Brightmail stock options in exchange for
1.2 million unvested options to purchase Symantec common
stock. The fair value of the assumed stock options was
$22 million using the Black-Scholes valuation model with
the following assumptions: weighted average volatility of 61%,
weighted average interest rate of 3.3%, and weighted average
life of 3.5 years. The intrinsic value of the unvested options
was valued at $21 million and was recorded in deferred
stock-based compensation within Stockholders’ Equity in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The difference between the fair
value and the intrinsic value of the unvested portion of the
options was an immaterial amount and was included in the
purchase price consideration.

The deferred stock-based compensation is being amortized to
operating expense over the remaining service periods of one to
four years. During the period from the acquisition date through
March 31, 2005, certain unvested options were cancelled as
a result of employee terminations, and deferred stock-based
compensation was reduced by $1 million. We recorded
amortization of deferred stock-based compensation from the
Brightmail transaction of $3 million during fiscal 2005.

Acquisition Costs

We incurred $2 million for acquisition-related expenses
resulting from financial advisory, legal, and accounting
services, as well as severance costs.

Purchase Price Allocation

The Merger Agreement provided for a six-month true up, providing
that the cash consideration payable to the former Brightmail
security holders be adjusted based on the value of stock options
assumed by us that were forfeited in the six months subsequent
to the Acquisition Date. As a result of the true up, the former
Brightmail security holders were required to return
approximately $654,000 to us. This reduction in the purchase
price reduced goodwill and is reflected in the purchase price
allocation below.

We have revised the preliminary purchase price allocation from
the amounts originally reported in our Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended July 2, 2004 primarily as a result of refining
various estimates related to the fair value of intangible assets
and deferred tax assets, as well as to reflect the results of
the six-month true up.

Acquired Product Rights

The amounts allocated to acquired product rights are being
amortized to Cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of
Income over their useful lives of two to five years.

Other Intangible Assets

The amounts allocated to other intangible assets include
customer base and trade names and are being amortized to
Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income over
their useful lives of one to two years.

Acquired IPR&D

We wrote off the acquired IPR&D totaling $3 million
because the acquired technologies had not reached technological
feasibility and had no alternative uses. The efforts required to
develop the acquired in-process technology principally related
to the completion of all planning, design, development, and
testing activities that were necessary to establish that the
product or service could be produced to meet its design
specifications, including features, functions, and performance.
We determined the fair value of the acquired in-process
technology by estimating the projected cash flows related to the
projects and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization
of the products. We discounted the resulting cash flows back to
their net present



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

values. We based the net cash flows from such projects on our
analysis of the respective markets and estimates of revenues and
operating profits related to these projects.

Goodwill

Goodwill of $227 million was generated in connection with
our acquisition of Brightmail because Brightmail is a market
leader in proven antispam products, which will provide us with a
reduced time-to-market in this area. In addition, Brightmail has
an experienced and knowledgeable workforce, including its
executive team, and an existing infrastructure. We also expect
to achieve product and cost synergies between the two companies.

Other Fiscal 2005 Acquisitions

TurnTide

On July 7, 2004, we acquired TurnTide, a developer of
antispam routers, for $28 million in cash, including an
immaterial amount for acquisition-related expenses resulting
from financial advisory, legal, and accounting services. We
expect the acquisition to strengthen our competitive position in
the enterprise security market by allowing us to provide
integrated antispam and antivirus solutions and by enabling the
building of a gateway security solution.

@stake

On October 7, 2004, we acquired @stake, a digital security
company that helps corporations secure their critical
infrastructure and applications, for $49 million in cash,
including an immaterial amount of acquisition-related expenses
resulting from financial advisory, legal, and accounting
services. We expect the acquisition to strengthen our
competitive position in the services market by strengthening our
presence in the security consulting sector and by increasing our
expertise in the areas of application, wireless, and critical
infrastructure security.

LIRIC

On October 11, 2004, we acquired LIRIC Associates, a
UK-based consultancy firm that offers expertise in assessing the
security needs of highly complex global networks and designing
the architecture and policies to secure these networks, for
$15 million in cash, including an immaterial amount for
acquisition-related expenses resulting from financial advisory,
legal, and accounting services. We expect the acquisition to
strengthen our competitive position in the services market by
strengthening our presence in the security consulting sector in
the UK and by increasing our expertise in the area of critical
infrastructure security.

Platform Logic

On December 9, 2004, we acquired Platform Logic, a
technology company that had developed a single host intrusion
prevention product, for $30 million in cash, including an
immaterial amount for acquisition-related expenses resulting
from financial advisory, legal, and accounting services. We
expect the acquisition to strengthen our competitive position in
the enterprise security sector by providing technology that is
complementary to our current offerings.

The table below provides details of the purchase price
allocations of these other fiscal 2005 acquisitions. The amounts
allocated to acquired product rights are being amortized to Cost
of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income over their
useful lives of one to five years. The amounts allocated to
other intangible assets include customer base and tradenames and
are being amortized to Operating expenses in the Consolidated
Statements of Income over their useful lives of three to eight
years.

Pending Acquisition

On December 16, 2004, we announced a definitive agreement
with VERITAS Software Corporation, or VERITAS, a leading
independent supplier of storage and infrastructure software
products and services. Under this agreement, we would acquire
all of the outstanding stock of VERITAS in exchange for
1.1242 shares of Symantec common stock for each outstanding
share of VERITAS common stock. In addition, we would assume all
outstanding VERITAS stock options with an exercise price less
than or equal to $49.00 per share, as well as each
outstanding option that was granted under certain specified
VERITAS option plans, as adjusted in accordance with the
exchange ratio. All other outstanding VERITAS stock options
would be cancelled. The estimated purchase price is
$13 billion, which includes the estimated fair value of
Symantec common stock to be issued and VERITAS options to be
assumed, as well as estimated direct transaction costs. We
derived this estimate using an average market price per share of
Symantec common stock of $25.87, which was based on an average
of the closing prices for a range of trading days
(December 14, 2004 through December 20, 2004,
inclusive) around the announcement date (December 16, 2004)
of the proposed transaction. The final purchase price would be
determined based upon the number of VERITAS shares and options
outstanding at the closing date. Completion of the transaction
is subject to customary closing conditions that include, among
others, receipt of required approvals from Symantec and VERITAS
stockholders. Under terms specified in the merger agreement,
Symantec or VERITAS may terminate the agreement and as a result
either Symantec or VERITAS may be required to pay a
$440 million termination fee to the other party in certain
circumstances. While we currently anticipate that we will be in
a position to complete the merger on or prior to June 30,
2005, we believe that there may be administrative benefits to
completing the merger at the beginning of our second quarter of
fiscal 2006. Symantec and VERITAS have therefore discussed the
possibility of closing the merger during the first week of that
fiscal quarter. Unless otherwise indicated, the discussions in
this document relate to Symantec as a stand-alone entity and do
not reflect the impact of the pending business combination
transaction with VERITAS.

Fiscal 2004 Acquisitions

During fiscal 2004, we acquired two public and two
privately-held companies for a total of $311 million in
cash, including acquisition-related expenses resulting from
financial advisory, legal, and accounting services, duplicate
sites, and severance costs. An insignificant amount of
acquisition-related expenses remain as an accrual as of
March 31, 2005. We recorded goodwill in connection with
each of these acquisitions. In each acquisition, goodwill
resulted primarily from our expectation of synergies from the
integration of the acquired company’s technology with our
technology and the acquired company’s access to our global
distribution network. In addition, each acquired company
provided a knowledgeable and experienced workforce. The results
of operations of the acquired companies have been included in
our operations from the dates of acquisition. ON Technology
Corp. and PowerQuest, Inc. are included in our Enterprise
Administration



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

segment, and SafeWeb, Inc. and Nexland, Inc. are included in our
Enterprise Security segment. For details of the purchase price
allocations, refer to Table 3.3 below. Our fiscal 2004
acquisitions were considered insignificant for pro forma
financial disclosure, both individually and in the aggregate.

ON Technology

On February 13, 2004, we acquired ON Technology, a global
provider of enterprise infrastructure management solutions, for
$109 million in cash, including $7 million of
acquisition-related expenses. The acquisition strengthened our
competitive position in the enterprise administration market by
allowing us to provide a unified solution that will help
customers create a secure enterprise infrastructure. ON
Technology’s software distribution and configuration
management capabilities will be a critical component to the
end-to-end system we are establishing to help customers build,
manage, and protect their IT infrastructures. Subsequent to the
acquisition, we revised the purchase price allocation to reduce
goodwill by $16 million, related to the final determination
of deferred tax assets upon filing ON Technology’s final
tax return.

PowerQuest

On December 5, 2003, we acquired PowerQuest, a global
provider of automated deployment and recovery solutions for
corporations and individual users, for $154 million in
cash, including $4 million of acquisition-related expenses.
The acquisition strengthened our competitive position in the
enterprise administration market by enabling us to deliver
solutions that allow customers to build, manage, and protect
their IT infrastructures with end-to-end security management
capabilities. Subsequent to the acquisition, we revised the
purchase price allocation to reduce goodwill by $6 million,
of which $5 million related to the final determination of
deferred tax assets upon filing PowerQuest’s final tax
return and $1 million related to the true up of liabilities
for severance and legal fees.

SafeWeb

On October 15, 2003, we acquired SafeWeb, a provider of SSL
VPN appliances, for $27 million in cash, including minimal
acquisition-related expenses. The acquisition strengthened our
competitive position in the enterprise security market by
allowing us to offer SafeWeb’s Secure Extranet Appliance
technology designed to reduce the cost and complexity of
deploying, managing, and maintaining secure access to remote
users.

Nexland

On July 17, 2003, we acquired Nexland, an Internet security
company whose Internet Protocol-based networking appliances are
installed at enterprise branches and telecommuter offices
worldwide, for $21 million in cash, including minimal
acquisition-related expenses. The acquisition strengthened our
competitive position in the enterprise security solutions market
as it is expected to allow us to further develop Symantec
integrated solutions.

The table below provides details of the purchase price
allocations of our fiscal 2004 acquisitions. The amounts
allocated to acquired product rights are being amortized to Cost
of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income over their
useful lives of one to five years. The amounts allocated to
other intangible assets includes customer base and tradenames
and are being amortized to Operating expenses in the
Consolidated Statements of Income over their useful lives of one
to seven years.

Fiscal 2003 Acquisitions

During fiscal 2003, we acquired four privately-held companies
for a total of $382 million in cash, including
acquisition-related expenses resulting from financial advisory,
legal, and accounting services, and severance costs. We recorded
goodwill in connection with each of these acquisitions. In each
acquisition, goodwill resulted primarily from our expectation of
synergies from the integration of the acquired company’s
technology with our technology and the acquired company’s
access to our global distribution network. In addition, each
required company provided a knowledgeable and experienced
workforce. The results of operations of the acquired companies
have been included in our operations from the dates of
acquisition. Recourse Technologies, Inc., SecurityFocus, Inc.,
and Mountain Wave, Inc. are included in our Enterprise Security
segment and Riptech, Inc. is included in our Services segment.

Goodwill, Acquired Product Rights and Other Intangible
    Assets

Goodwill by operating segment is as follows:

During fiscal 2005, we adjusted goodwill related to business
acquisitions completed prior to March 31, 2004, including
Axent Technologies within the Enterprise Security segment, On
Technology and PowerQuest within the Enterprise Administration
segment, and Quarterdeck Corporation within the Consumer
Products segment. Goodwill related to Quarterdeck, purchased in
the March 1999 quarter, and Axent, purchased in the December
2000 quarter, were adjusted based on final deferred tax
determinations. For more information regarding our goodwill
adjustment to ON Technology and PowerQuest, see Note 3,

Acquisitions.

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or earlier
if indicators of impairment exist. We completed our annual
goodwill impairment test required by SFAS No. 142
during the March 2005 quarter and determined that there was no
impairment of goodwill.

On March 31, 2005, we entered into a patent license
agreement with Tumbleweed Communications Corporation. The total
cost of the patent license agreement was $1 million, which
was paid in cash in March 2005. Under the transaction, we
recorded $375,000 of patent settlement costs in the March 2005
quarter that were related to benefits received by us in and
prior to the March 2005 quarter. The remaining amount was
recorded as an asset and is being amortized to Cost of revenues
in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining life
of the patent, which expires in March 2010.

On January 28, 2005 we purchased technology patents from
ReefEdge, Inc. for $800,000 in cash, which we recorded as
acquired product rights. The acquired product rights are being
amortized to Cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of
Income over the estimated useful life of 5 years.

On August 6, 2003, we purchased a security technology
patent as part of a settlement in

Hilgraeve, Inc. v.
Symantec Corporation.

As part of the settlement, we also
received licenses to the remaining patents in Hilgraeve’s
portfolio. The total cost of purchasing the patent and licensing
additional patents was $63 million, which was paid in cash
in August 2003. Under the transaction, we recorded
$14 million of patent settlement costs in the June 2003
quarter that were related to benefits received by us in and
prior to the June 2003 quarter. The remaining $49 million
was recorded as acquired product rights and is being amortized
to Cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income
over the remaining life of the primary patent, which expires in
June 2011.

On April 17, 2003, we purchased acquired product rights
related to Roxio Inc.’s GoBack computer recovery software
business for $13 million in cash. The acquired product
rights are being amortized to Cost of revenues over their
estimated useful life of three years.

During fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003, amortization expense for
acquired product rights was $49 million, $41 million,
and $30 million, respectively. Amortization of acquired
product rights was included in Cost of revenues in the

Investments

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

The estimated fair value of the cash equivalents and short-term
investments consisted of the following:

The estimated fair value of cash equivalents and short-term
investments by contractual maturity as of March 31, 2005
was as follows:

(In thousands)

Due in one year or less

$

2,948,100

Due after one year and through 3 years

15,182

$

2,963,282

Fair values of cash equivalents and short-term investments
approximate cost primarily due to the short-term maturities of
the investments and the absence of changes in security credit
ratings.

Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities
were reported as a component of Stockholders’ Equity and
were immaterial for all periods presented.

Equity Investments in Privately Held Companies

As of March 31, 2005 and 2004, we held equity investments
with a carrying value of $11 million in several
privately-held companies. These investments were recorded at
cost as we do not have significant influence over the investee
and are classified as Other long-term assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recognized
a decline in value of these investments determined to be
other-than-temporary of $1 million, $3 million, and
$1 million, respectively. The other-than-temporary declines
in fair value were recorded as Interest and other income, net on
the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Note 6.

Convertible Subordinated Notes

On October 24, 2001, we completed a private offering of
$600 million 3% convertible subordinated notes due
November 1, 2006, the net proceeds of which were
$585 million. The notes were convertible into shares of our
common stock by the holders at any time before maturity at a
conversion price of $8.54 per share, subject to certain
adjustments. We had the right to redeem the remaining notes on
or after November 5, 2004, at a redemption price of 100.75%
of stated principal during the period November 5, 2004
through October 31, 2005. Interest was paid semi-annually
and we commenced making these payments on May 1, 2002. Debt



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

issuance costs of $16 million related to the notes were
being amortized on a straight-line basis through
November 1, 2006. We had reserved 70.3 million shares
of common stock for issuance upon conversion of the notes.

On July 20, 2004, our Board of Directors approved the
redemption of all of the outstanding convertible subordinated
notes and in September 2004 we sent notice to registered holders
that all notes would be redeemed November 5, 2004. As of
November 4, 2004 (the day prior to the redemption date),
substantially all of the outstanding convertible subordinated
notes were converted into 70.3 million shares of our common
stock. The remainder was redeemed for cash. Unamortized debt
issuance costs of $6 million relative to the converted
notes were charged to Capital in excess of par value on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet during fiscal 2005.

Note 7.

Commitments

Leases

We lease certain of our facilities and equipment under operating
leases that expire at various dates through 2018. We currently
sublease some space under various operating leases that will
expire at various dates through 2008.

The future fiscal year minimum operating lease commitments were
as follows as of March 31, 2005:

Based on existing subleases, we expect to record future sublease
income of $5 million, $3 million, and $1 million
during fiscal 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively, and
insignificant amounts per year thereafter.

Rent expense charged to operations totaled $35 million,
$27 million, and $25 million during fiscal 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

In March 2003, we terminated our synthetic lease obligations for
four facilities located in Cupertino, California, Springfield,
Oregon, and Newport News, Virginia by purchasing the land and
buildings for $124 million.

Pending Merger

Under certain terms specified in the merger agreement, Symantec
or VERITAS may terminate the agreement and as a result either
Symantec or VERITAS may be required to pay a $440 million
termination fee to the other party in certain circumstances.

Development Agreement

During the March 2005 quarter, we entered into a development
agreement in the amount of $22 million in connection with
the refurbishment of a building in Dublin, Ireland. Payment of
this amount is contingent upon the achievement of certain
agreed-upon milestones. As none of these milestones have been
reached as of March 31, 2005, there is no accrual relative
to the $22 million commitment included in our liabilities
on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2005.

Royalties

We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment
and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally
based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of
underlying revenue. Certain royalty commitments have minimum
commitment obligations; however, as of March 31, 2005 all
such obligations are immaterial.

Indemnification

As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we
indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or
occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at
our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers
all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s
or director’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of
future payments we could be required to make under these
indemnification agreements is not limited; however, we have
director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our
exposure and enables us to recover a portion or all of any
future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of
these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable
insurance coverage is minimal.

Note 8.

Stock Transactions

Stock Repurchases

On January 16, 2001, our Board of Directors replaced an
earlier stock repurchase authorization with a new authorization
to repurchase up to $700 million of Symantec common stock,
not to exceed 60.0 million shares, with no expiration date.
On January 20, 2004, our Board of Directors increased the
dollar amount of our stock repurchase authorization from
$700 million to $940 million, without any specific
limit on the number of shares to be repurchased. On
October 19, 2004, our Board of Directors increased the
dollar amount of our stock repurchase authorization by
$300 million, without any specific limit on the number of
shares to be repurchased. In connection with the stock
repurchase authorizations, we have a repurchase plan under
Rule 10b5-1 to facilitate stock repurchases up to
$60 million per quarter. Pending the completion of the
proposed merger with VERITAS Software, we will be subject to a
regulatory limitation that limits the level of quarterly
repurchases allowed.

During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 7.8 million shares under
the amended stock repurchase authorization, at prices ranging
from $21.05 to $30.77 per share, for an aggregate amount of
$192 million. During fiscal 2004, we repurchased
3.0 million shares under the amended stock repurchase
authorization, at prices ranging from $19.52 to $20.82 per
share, for an aggregate amount of $60 million. During
fiscal 2003, we repurchased 8.8 million shares at prices
ranging from $6.99 to $7.49 per share, for an aggregate amount
of $64 million.

On March 28, 2005, the Board of Directors increased the
dollar amount of authorized stock repurchases by $3 billion
effective upon completion of the VERITAS merger, without any
specific limit on the number of shares to be repurchased. We
expect to repurchase shares pursuant to this authorization for
cash as business conditions warrant between the date of the
completion of the merger and March 31, 2006. Excluding the
post-merger authorization, as of March 31, 2005,
$475 million remained authorized by our Board of Directors.

Stock Dividends

On October 19, 2004, our Board of Directors approved a
two-for-one stock split to be effected as a stock dividend.
Stockholders of record at the close of business on
November 11, 2004 were issued one additional share of
common stock for each share owned as of that date. An additional
353 million shares resulting from the stock dividend were
issued in book-entry form on November 30, 2004.

On October 22, 2003, our Board of Directors approved a
two-for-one stock split to be effected in the form of a stock
dividend. Stockholders of record at the close of business on
November 5, 2003 were issued one additional share of common
stock for each share owned as of that date. An additional
154 million shares resulting from the stock dividend were
issued in book-entry form on November 19, 2003.

Increase to Authorized Shares

On September 15, 2004, our stockholders approved the
adoption of our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation, which increased the number of authorized shares
of common stock from 900,000,000 to 1,600,000,000.

Note 9.

Net Income Per Share

The components of net income per share were as follows:

During fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003, 4.2 million,
1.7 million, and 2.8 million shares, respectively,
issuable from the assumed exercise of options were excluded from
the computation of diluted net income per share as their effect
would have been anti-dilutive.

Note 10.

Adoption of Stockholder Rights Plan

On August 11, 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a
stockholder rights plan designed to ensure orderly consideration
of any future unsolicited acquisition attempt to ensure a fair
value of Symantec for our stockholders. In connection with the
plan, the Board of Directors declared and paid a dividend of one
preferred share purchase right for each share of Symantec common
stock outstanding on the record date, August 21, 1998. The
rights are initially attached to Symantec common stock and will
not trade separately. If a person or a group, an Acquiring
Person, acquires 20% or more of our common stock, or announces
an intention to make a tender offer for 20% or more of our
common stock, the rights will be distributed and will thereafter
trade separately from the common stock.

If the rights become exercisable, each right (other than rights
held by the Acquiring Person) will entitle the holder to
purchase, at a price equal to the exercise price of the right, a
number of shares of our common stock having a then-current value
of twice the exercise price of the right. If, after the rights
become exercisable, we agree to merge into another entity or we
sell more than 50% of our assets, each right will entitle the
holder to purchase, at a price equal to the exercise price of
the right, a number of shares of common stock of such entity
having a then-current value of twice the exercise price.

We may exchange the rights at a ratio of one share of common
stock for each right (other than the Acquiring Person) at any
time after an Acquiring Person acquires 20% or more of our
common stock but before such person acquires 50% or more of our
common stock. We may also redeem the rights at our option at a
price of $0.001 per right at any time before an Acquiring
Person has acquired 20% or more of our common stock. The rights
will expire on August 12, 2008.

Note 11.

Employee Benefits

401(k) Plan

We maintain a salary deferral 401(k) plan for all of our
domestic employees. This plan allows employees to contribute up
to 20% of their pretax salary up to the maximum dollar
limitation prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. We match
100% of the first $500 of employees’ contributions and 50%
of the employees’ contribution over $500. The maximum
employer match in any given plan year is 3% of the
employees’ eligible compensation. Our contributions under
the plan were $8 million, $7 million, and
$4 million during fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Restricted Shares

On October 20, 2004, we issued 200,000 restricted shares of
common stock to our current Senior Vice President of Finance and
Chief Financial Officer, at a purchase price of $1,000
(representing the aggregate par value at the date of issuance),
vesting 50% at each anniversary date. The market value of the
common stock on the date of grant less the purchase price was
$6 million and was recorded in Deferred stock-based
compensation within Stockholders’ Equity in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets during fiscal 2005. The deferred
stock-based compensation is being amortized over the two-year
service period. We recorded amortization expense of
$1 million during fiscal 2005.

During fiscal 1999, we issued 800,000 restricted shares to our
current Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, for a purchase price of
$1,000 (representing the aggregate par value at the date of
issuance), vesting 50% at each anniversary date, which commenced
April 14, 2000. The market value of the common stock on the
date of grant less the purchase price, was recorded in Deferred
stock-based compensation within Stockholders’ Equity in the
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets during fiscal 1999. The
deferred stock-based compensation was amortized over the
two-year service period.

Stock Purchase Plans

2002 Executive Officers’ Stock Purchase Plan

In September 2002, our stockholders approved the 2002 Executive
Officers’ Stock Purchase Plan and reserved
250,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder, of
which none are subject to adjustment pursuant to changes in
capital. The purpose of the plan is to provide executive
officers with a means to acquire an equity interest in Symantec
at fair market value by applying a portion or all of their
respective bonus payments towards the purchase price. Each
executive officer may purchase up to 10,000 shares in any
fiscal year. As of March 31, 2005, no shares have been
issued under the plan and the entire 250,000 shares remain
available for future issuance. Shares reserved for issuance
under this plan have not been adjusted for the stock dividends.

1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In September 1998, our stockholders approved the 1998 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan and reserved 4.0 million shares of
common stock for issuance thereunder. In September 1999, the
plan was amended by our stockholders to increase the shares
available for issuance by 6.1 million and to add an
“evergreen” provision whereby the number of shares
available for issuance increases automatically on January 1 of
each year (beginning in 2000) by 1% of our outstanding shares of
common stock on each immediately preceding December 31
during the term of the plan. In July 2004, the Board of
Directors eliminated this provision. As of March 31, 2005,
22.3 million shares remain available for issuance under the
plan.

Subject to certain limitations, our employees may purchase,
through payroll deductions of 2% to 10% of their compensation,
shares of common stock at a price per share that is the lesser
of 85% of the fair market value as of the beginning of the
two-year offering period or the end of the six-month purchase
period. In March 2005, the Board of Directors eliminated the
two-year offering period. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan will
continue to allow employees to purchase shares of common stock
at a price per share that is 85% of the fair market value on the
purchase date. Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
3.2 million, 2.9 million, and 4.3 million shares
were issued during fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively,
representing $32 million, $23 million, and
$17 million in contributions, respectively. As of
March 31, 2005, a total of 16.3 million shares had
been issued under this plan.

Stock Award Plans

2000 Director Equity Incentive Plan

In September 2000, our stockholders approved the
2000 Director Equity Incentive Plan and reserved
50,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder. In
September 2004, stockholders increased the number of shares of
stock that may be issued by 50,000. In addition, in September
2004, stockholders approved an amendment to the 2000 Director
Equity Incentive Plan such that it may be proportionately
adjusted upon any changes in capital structure. Therefore,
reserve amounts have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one
stock split, effected as a stock dividend in November 2004. The
purpose of this plan is to provide the members of the Board of
Directors with an opportunity to receive common stock for all or
a portion of the retainer payable to each director for serving
as a member. Each director may elect to receive 50% to 100% of
the retainer to be paid in the form of stock. As of
March 31, 2005, a total of 41,000 shares had been
issued under this plan and 59,000 shares remained available
for future issuance.

Stock Option Plans

We maintain stock option plans pursuant to which an aggregate
total of 108 million shares of common stock have been
reserved for issuance as incentive and nonqualified stock
options to employees, officers, directors, consultants,
independent contractors, and advisors to us, or of any parent,
subsidiary, or affiliate of



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

Symantec as the Board of Directors or committee may determine.
The purpose of these plans is to attract, retain, and motivate
eligible persons whose present and potential contributions are
important to our success by offering them an opportunity to
participate in our future performance through awards of stock
options and stock bonuses. Under the terms of these plans, the
option exercise price may not be less than 100% of the fair
market value on the date of grant and the options have a maximum
term of ten years and generally vest over a four-year period.

2004 Equity Incentive Plan

In September 2004, stockholders approved the terms of the 2004
Equity Incentive Plan and reserved 18.0 million shares for
issuance thereunder. Up to 10% of the shares reserved may be
granted in the form of restricted stock awards. Under this plan,
we grant options to employees, officers, directors, consultants,
independent contractors, and advisors to us, or of any parent,
subsidiary, or affiliate of Symantec as the Board of Directors
or committee may determine. This plan will supercede the 1996
Equity Incentive Plan when it expires in March 2006. Under terms
of this plan, the Compensation Committee determines whether an
option will be an incentive stock option or a non-qualified
stock option. Options generally are subject to a four-year
vesting period with a one-year period before any vesting occurs,
and the exercise price may not be less than 100% of the fair
market value of one share of Symantec common stock on the date
of the grant. As of March 31, 2005, no options have been
issued under this plan.

2001 Non-Qualified Equity Incentive Plan

In January 2001, the Board of Directors approved the terms of
the 2001 Non-Qualified Equity Incentive Plan and reserved for
issuance 24.0 million shares for issuance thereunder.
Options awarded to insiders, defined as officers, directors, or
other persons subject to Section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, may not exceed in the aggregate fifty
(50%) percent of all shares that are available for grant under
the plan and employees of the company who are not insiders must
receive at least fifty (50%) percent of all shares that are
available for grant under the plan. The terms of this plan were
similar to those of our 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, except that
only non-qualified stock options could be granted and it was
adopted, and could be amended, without stockholder approval. In
September 2004, as a result of the adoption of the 2004 Equity
Incentive Plan, we terminated the plan. As of March 31,
2005, 2.8 million options were outstanding under this plan
and no shares remained available for future issuance.

1999 Acquisition Plan

In July 1999, the Board of Directors approved the terms of the
1999 Acquisition Plan and reserved 4.0 million shares of
common stock for issuance thereunder. Options awarded to
officers may not exceed in the aggregate thirty (30%) percent of
all shares that are available for grant under the plan. The
terms of this plan are similar to those of our 2004 Equity
Incentive Plan, except that it was adopted, and may be amended,
without stockholder approval. As of March 31, 2005, 137,000
options were outstanding under this plan and none remain
available for future issuance.

1996 Equity Incentive Plan

In May 1996, our stockholders approved the 1996 Equity Incentive
Plan and reserved 32.6 million shares of common stock for
issuance thereunder. Subsequently, our stockholders approved a
number of amendments that increased the number of shares of
common stock reserved for issuance under the plan to a total of
195.5 million shares. As of March 31, 2005,
64.1 million options were outstanding under this plan and
21.0 million remained available for future issuance.

Executive Stock Option Grants

In accordance with our CEO’s, employment agreement dated
April 11, 1999, the Board of Directors approved the
issuance of a non-qualified stock option to acquire
1.6 million shares of common stock to the CEO. The option
was granted at 100% of the fair market value on the date of
grant, has a term life of ten years, and vests over a five-year
period. As of March 31, 2005, no options were outstanding.

On December 20, 1999, a non-qualified option to acquire
160,000 shares was approved for grant to the CEO and was
deemed granted on January 1, 2000. The option was granted
at 100% of the fair market value on the date of grant, has a
term life of ten years, and vests over a four-year period. As of
March 31, 2005, all options were still outstanding under
this grant.

1988 Employee Stock Option Plan

The 1988 Employee Stock Option Plan was superseded by the 1996
Equity Incentive Plan. As of March 31, 2005, 152,000
options were outstanding under the 1998 Employee Stock Option
Plan and no further options may be granted.

Acquired Stock Option Plans

We assumed stock option plans in connection with our
acquisitions of Brightmail in June 2004, AXENT Technologies in
December 2000, and Central Point Software in June 1994. As of
March 31, 2005, 1.4 million options were outstanding
under these plans and no further options may be granted.

Note 12.     Restructuring

During fiscal 2005, we recorded $3 million of restructuring
charges, of which $2 million was for costs of severance,
related benefits, and outplacement services related to the
termination of 51 employees located in the United States and
Europe due to the consolidation and relocation of engineering
and development functions. In addition we recorded an increase
to the accrual relating to the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan of
$1 million due to the termination of a sublease agreement
for facilities in Eugene, Oregon. As of March 31, 2005,
substantially all of the costs were paid.

During fiscal 2004, we recorded $1 million of restructuring
charges for costs of severance, related benefits, and
outplacement services for a member of our senior management
team, as well as an increase to the accrual for excess
facilities in Eugene, Oregon in connection with our fiscal 2002
restructuring plan. As of March 31, 2005, substantially all
of the costs were paid.

During fiscal 2003, we recorded $11 million of
restructuring charges, including costs of severance, related
benefits, and outplacement services of $8 million and costs
associated with the consolidation of certain facilities in the
United States and Europe of $3 million. The costs resulted
from relocating certain development, sales, and finance
activities, realigning certain worldwide marketing efforts, and
outsourcing our North American and European consumer support
functions. As a result, we terminated 424 employees. As of
March 31, 2005, substantially all of the costs were paid.

During fiscal 2002, we recorded costs associated with excess
facilities and fixed assets associated with relocating certain
sites in the United States and Europe. We moved our operations
in Newport News, Virginia to a larger facility and we relocated
our North American support group from Eugene, Oregon to an
expanded facility in Springfield, Oregon. In addition, we
consolidated our European support functions by relocating our
Leiden, Netherlands operations to Dublin, Ireland and
consolidating most of our United Kingdom facilities to one
facility in Maidenhead, UK. As of March 31, 2005,
$3 million remained accrued for excess facility costs. The
accrual is classified in Other accrued liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2005. We
anticipate that substantially all of the remaining restructuring
reserve balance will be paid by the end of fiscal 2006.

The principal components of deferred tax assets were as follows:

The valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets increased by
$420,000 during fiscal 2005 and increased by $2 million
during fiscal 2004.

As of March 31, 2005, we have net operating loss
carryforwards attributable to various acquired companies of
$190 million that expire in fiscal 2011 through 2024. These
net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual
limitation under Internal Revenue Code §382, but are
expected to be fully realized. Pretax income from international
operations was $499 million, $354 million, and
$225 million for fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

No provision has been made for federal or state income taxes on
$601 million of cumulative unremitted earnings of certain
of our foreign subsidiaries as of March 31, 2005, since we
plan to indefinitely reinvest these earnings. As of
March 31, 2005, the unrecognized deferred tax liability for
these earnings was $179 million.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004, or the Jobs Act, was signed into law. Under the Jobs Act,
we may elect an 85% dividends-received deduction for
repatriating eligible dividends from our foreign subsidiaries in
either the year ended March 31, 2005 or 2006. Certain
criteria must be met to qualify for the deduction, including the
establishment of a domestic reinvestment plan by our CEO, and
the approval of the plan by our Board of Directors, whereby the
repatriated earnings must be reinvested in the United States.
The maximum amount of our foreign earnings that qualify for the
deduction is $500 million.

During the March 2005 quarter, we repatriated $500 million
from certain of our foreign subsidiaries under the Jobs Act
provisions. We recorded a tax charge for this repatriation of
approximately $54 million in accordance with tax laws
existing at the time. See Note 17,

Subsequent
Events

, for a discussion of subsequent clarification of the
tax law.

The $500 million repatriation under the Jobs Act was deemed
to be distributed entirely from foreign earnings that had been
previously treated as indefinitely reinvested. However, this
distribution from previously

indefinitely reinvested earnings does not change our position
going forward that future earnings of certain of our foreign
subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested.

Litigation

On August 26, 2004, SRI International, Inc. filed a lawsuit
against us in the United States District Court, District of
Delaware, alleging that unspecified Symantec products, including
ManHunt, infringed four patents owned by SRI. The lawsuit
requests damages, injunctive relief, costs, and attorneys’
fees. We intend to defend the action vigorously.

On November 17, 2003, Health & Sport LLC filed a
lawsuit on behalf of itself and purportedly on behalf of the
general public and a class including purchasers of Norton
AntiVirus 2004 and/or Norton Internet Security 2004 in the
California Superior Court, San Francisco County. This case
was subsequently moved to Santa Clara County. The complaint
alleges violations of California Business and Professions Code
17200 and 17500 and breach of express and implied warranties in
connection with the specified products. The complaint seeks
damages and injunctive and other equitable relief, as well as
costs and attorneys’ fees. We intend to defend the action
vigorously.

On March 28, 2003, Ronald Pearce filed a lawsuit on behalf
of himself and purportedly on behalf of the general public of
the United States and Canada in the California Superior Court,
Santa Clara County, alleging violations of California
Business and Professions Code section 17200 and false
advertising in connection with our

product. The complaint seeks damages and injunctive and other
equitable relief, as well as costs and attorney fees. We intend
to defend the action vigorously.

On December 23, 1999, Altiris Inc. filed a lawsuit against
us in the United States District Court, District of Utah,
alleging that unspecified Symantec products, including Norton
Ghost Enterprise Edition, infringed a patent owned by Altiris.
The lawsuit requested damages, injunctive relief, costs, and
attorney fees. In October 2001, a stipulated judgment of
non-infringement was entered following the court’s ruling
construing the claims of the Altiris patent, and, in February
2003, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the
judgment and remanded the case. In April 2004, we filed a
lawsuit against Altiris in the United States District Court,
Eastern District of Texas, alleging that several Altiris
products infringe three patents owned by Symantec, and Altiris
filed counterclaims based on additional patents. In May 2005,
all pending patent litigation between the companies was settled.
See Note 17,

Subsequent Events

, for further
discussion of the resolution.

We have an active anti-piracy program designed to enforce
copyright and trademark protection of our software. Portions of
this program are handled internally or through counsel, and
portions are handled on our behalf by the Business Software
Alliance, or BSA. A significant part of this program includes
working with law enforcement agencies or civil litigation
against alleged infringers. Such activities sometimes lead to
claims alleging improper use of the legal process or violation
of other local law. This type of claim has recently increased in
frequency, especially in Latin American countries. To date, none
of such claims has resulted in material damages and we do not
believe that any such pending claims, individually or in the
aggregate, will result in a material adverse effect on our
future results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.

Over the past few years, it has become common for software
companies, including us, to receive claims of patent
infringement. At any given time, we are evaluating claims of
patent infringement asserted by several parties with respect to
certain of our products. The outcome of any related litigation
or negotiation could have a material adverse impact on our
future results of operations or cash flows.

We are also involved in a number of other judicial and
administrative proceedings that are incidental to our business.
We intend to defend all pending lawsuits vigorously. Although
adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur in one or more of
the cases, and it is not possible to estimate the possible loss
or losses from each of these cases, the final resolution of
these lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, is not
expected to



SYMANTEC CORPORATION

have a material adverse affect on our financial condition. We
have accrued estimated legal fees and expenses related to
certain of these matters; however, actual amounts may differ
materially from those estimated amounts.

Note 15.

Segment Information

Our operating segments are significant strategic business units
that offer different products and services, distinguished by
customer needs. We have five operating segments: Consumer
Products, Enterprise Security, Enterprise Administration,
Services, and Other.

Our Consumer Products segment focuses on delivering our Internet
security and problem-solving products to individual users, home
offices, and small businesses. Our Enterprise Security segment
provides security solutions for all tiers of a network: at the
server tier behind the gateway and at the client tier, including
desktop personal computers, or PCs, laptops, and handhelds. Our
Enterprise Administration segment offers open and modular
products and services that enable companies to effectively and
efficiently manage their IT infrastructures.

Our Services segment provides information security solutions
that incorporate advanced technology, security best practices
and expertise, and global resources to help enable e-business
success. Our Other segment is comprised of sunset products and
products nearing the end of their life cycle. Also included in
the Other segment are all indirect costs, general and
administrative expenses, amortization of other intangible
assets, and other assets and charges, such as acquired
in-process research and development, patent settlement,
amortization of deferred compensation, and restructuring which
are not charged to the other operating segments.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting polices, with
the exception of the amortization of acquired product rights,
which is included entirely in our Other segment. There are no
intersegment sales. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates
performance based on direct profit or loss from operations
before income taxes not including nonrecurring gains and losses,
foreign exchange gains and losses, and miscellaneous other
income and expenses. The majority of our assets and liabilities
are not discretely allocated or reviewed by segment. The
depreciation and amortization of our property, equipment, and
leasehold improvements are allocated based on headcount, unless
specifically identified by segment.

Note 16.

Cumulative Adjustment to Net Revenues and Deferred Revenue

In August 2004, during a review of our revenue maintenance
application used to calculate the amount of deferred revenue for
our consumer products, we discovered an error in the unit
renewal prices manually entered into the application. The unit
renewal prices used to calculate the deferred revenue did not
reflect the correct subscription renewal prices for foreign
currency sales, which serves as the basis for our deferral. As a
result, the deferred revenue from these consumer products was
understated and the portion of revenue from these products that
was recognized at the time of sale was overstated. The
cumulative overstatement of revenue for periods prior to the
three months ended June 30, 2004 totaled approximately
$20 million. The effect of the error was not material to
any prior period. To correct this error, we booked the
cumulative $20 million as a reduction in Net revenues in
the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and a
corresponding $20 million increase in Current deferred
revenue on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet during the
three-month period ended June 2004. Substantially all of the
$20 million of current deferred revenue was recognized as
revenue during fiscal 2005.

Note 17.

Subsequent Events

On May 12, 2005, we resolved the Altiris patent litigation
matters with a cross-licensing agreement that resolves all legal
claims between the companies. As part of a settlement, we paid
Altiris $10 million for use of the disputed technology.

On May 12, 2005, we acquired XtreamLok Pty, Ltd., an information
security company that specializes in anti-piracy and product
activation technology, for approximately $17 million in
cash.

In May 2005, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the
Internal Revenue Service issued clarifying language with respect
to the treatment of foreign taxes paid on the earnings
repatriated under the Jobs Act. As a result of this clarifying
language, we will reduce the $54 million tax expense
attributable to the $500 million repatriation by
approximately $20 million, to $34 million. This
reduction in tax expense will be recorded in our first quarter
of fiscal 2006.
