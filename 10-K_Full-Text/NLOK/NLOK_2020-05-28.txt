PART I

ITEM 1. Business

Overview

NortonLifeLock is a trusted brand and leading provider of Cyber Safety solutions for consumers worldwide. Our business is built around the prevention, detection and restoration of potential damages caused by cyber criminals. The need for NortonLifeLock’s products is more critical than ever in today’s increasingly digital world, as people transition to remote work environments, conduct virtual meetings, and engage in online gaming, streaming, shopping, telemedicine and numerous other online transactions and activities on a daily basis. With each new digital interaction comes increased risk for consumers as cyber criminals look to take advantage of this accelerating trend. NortonLifeLock stands between today’s cyber criminals and consumers, helping secure the devices, identities, online privacy, and home and family needs of nearly 50 million consumers globally. We are a trusted ally for our customers in a complex digital world and are committed to advancing our mission of protecting each element of their digital lives.

We offer subscription-based Cyber Safety solutions to consumers under the NortonLifeLock brand, with our integrated cyber safety platform Norton 360. Norton 360’s integrated experience, and substantial scale and reach, provide extensive cyber safety coverage to our members. In addition to Norton 360, we also offer standalone products for device security, privacy, identity, and home and family protection in certain channels and geographies.

We sell our products primarily direct-to-consumer through our in-house e-commerce platform, and indirectly through partner relationships with retailers, telecom service providers, hardware original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and employee benefit providers. Most of our subscriptions are sold on either annual or monthly terms. As of April 3, 2020, we served over 20 million direct customers and approximately 30 million more through partners or other indirect channels. Our annual retention rate was 85% for fiscal 2020. Please see “Performance Metrics” under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7.

Our transformation into a pure-play consumer company follows the sale of our enterprise assets and name change from Symantec Corporation to NortonLifeLock Inc. Founded in 1982, we formerly did business under the Symantec Corporation name as the Consumer Cyber Safety division. The sale of our Enterprise Security assets to Broadcom Inc. (Broadcom) and the sale of our ID Analytics business to LexisNexis Risk Solutions, part of RELX Inc., were completed in fiscal year 2020.

Industry Overview

Cyber crime, and the ways in which cyber criminals target consumers, continue to evolve along with behaviors and technology. Cyber crime encompasses any crime committed digitally over the internet and includes crimes where (i) malicious software or unauthorized access is detected on a device, network or online account (including email, social media, online banking, online retail, etc.); (ii) an individual is digitally victimized through a data breach, cyber theft, cyber extortion, or fraud (stolen personally identifiable information, identity theft); or (iii) online stalking, bullying, or harassment is inflicted.

As cyber crime becomes an intensifying threat to our world, consumers are increasingly concerned. Our annual NortonLifeLock Cyber Safety Insights Report evaluates current cyber crime trends to provide a snapshot of the impact of cyber crime. According to the 2019 report, which is based on research conducted online by The Harris Poll on behalf of us, almost 500 million consumers have been the victim of a cyber crime, with nearly 350 million in the last year alone. While many report having taken at least one step to protect their online activities and personal information, most people are taking only basic steps (clearing cookies, limiting information shared on social media) and few are going to greater lengths such as using anonymous payment methods, deleting social media accounts, or using a virtual private network (VPN).

Cyber Safety Solutions and Services

We help consumers by providing Cyber Safety subscription solutions with an integrated user experience under the NortonLifeLock brand, called Norton 360. Our Norton 360 subscriptions include multiple levels of membership tiers that incorporate solutions from each of our Cyber Safety categories: Device Security, Identity Protection, Online Privacy, and Home and Family Safety. We also provide these solutions as standalone products in certain channels and geographies. Our Consumer Cyber Safety solutions include the following offerings:

•

Device Security (Norton Security):

Our Norton Security solution provides real-time protection for PCs, Macs and mobile devices against malware, viruses, adware, ransomware and other online threats. It monitors and blocks unauthorized traffic from the internet to the device to help protect private and sensitive information when customers are online. For mobile devices, Norton Security alerts customers of risky apps, safeguards against fraudulent and malicious websites, identifies Wi-Fi networks that are under attack, enables stolen device recovery, and blocks unwanted spam and potential fraud calls. Norton Security includes 24x7 support by trained support agents. We provide on-call support and offer a money-back guarantee if we cannot remove viruses from infected devices through our Virus Protection Promise.

•

Identity Protection (LifeLock Identity Theft Protection):

Our LifeLock identity theft protection solution includes monitoring, alerts and restoration services to protect the safety of our customers. We monitor events that may present a risk of identity theft, such as new account openings and applications. If we detect that a customer’s personally identifiable



information is being used, we deliver notifications and alerts to our customers about potentially suspicious activity. In the event of identity theft, we assign an Identity Restoration Specialist to work directly with customers to help restore their identities. Customers are further protected by our Million Dollar Protection Package, which provides reimbursement for stolen funds and coverage for personal expenses.

•

Online Privacy (Norton Secure VPN and SurfEasy VPN):

As people are exchanging more sensitive information through digital channels - be it personal healthcare information to enable tele-health or financial information for personal accounting, having a VPN has become even more crucial. Our Norton Secure VPN and SurfEasy VPN enhance security and online privacy by providing an encrypted data tunnel. This allows customers to securely transmit and access private information such as passwords, bank details and credit card numbers when using public Wi-Fi on PCs, Macs and mobile iOS and Android devices. Our VPN service allows customers to browse the Web anonymously to protect their online privacy and prevent tracking by online advertisers and other companies. Customers can also change their virtual location when they are traveling internationally to allow them to connect to their favorite apps, websites and online streaming services as if they are in their home-country.

•

Home and Family (Norton Family):

As entire households now spend hours online, whether for school, work, or personal use, protecting the home and family in a simple way is even more of a need. Norton Family brings the protection and security of our products to every member of the family across multiple devices and platforms. Norton Family also provides Parental Controls tools for parents to monitor kids’ online activities, including videos watched, websites visited, terms searched, and apps downloaded. Parents can manage how much time kids spend online and block access to inappropriate websites. Norton Family also provides GPS location monitoring for mobile devices and content filtering for PCs.

Our Strategy

Our goal is to be the trusted cyber security partner for consumers across the globe and enable them to manage their digital lives safely. The threat landscape is larger, more complicated and more connected than ever before, exposing consumers to an increased risk to their security, online privacy, home networks and identities. As the risks to consumers continue to expand from device-based attacks to more sophisticated threats such as fraud, ransomware, identity theft and privacy risks, our solutions have evolved to provide a multi-layered approach in protecting against threats, detecting attacks and helping customers manage across their digital footprint, including their technology, applications, networks and identities.

The cornerstone of our strategy is to provide consumers with a platform that brings together superior software and service capabilities to enable all facets of Cyber Safety, including device security, identity protection, online privacy, and home and family safety. By combining and leveraging our portfolio of Norton and LifeLock offerings, we are able to deliver an industry-leading set of Cyber Safety solutions. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include the following:

Extend our leadership position through continued enhancement of our solutions and services.

The Cyber Safety industry is large and expanding, which provides a significant growth opportunity. We intend to grow our business by investing in research and development and making acquisitions to expand the solutions and services we offer into new cohorts, territories and sectors. We believe there are many additional areas where we can both offer new solutions, as well as use our core capabilities to deliver offerings to new customers and markets.

Grow our customer base.

We intend to leverage our expertise in digital marketing, as well as existing and new strategic partnerships, to grow our customer base. We believe that continued investments in these areas, as well as our product offerings and infrastructure, will allow us to further enhance our leading brand and superior products, increase awareness of our consumer services and enhance our ability to efficiently acquire new customers.

Continue our focus on customer retention.

We plan to invest in increasing customer retention by optimizing and expanding the value we provide through actionable alerts, education on timely topics, and new capabilities. We aim to provide our customers with peace of mind and convenience, demonstrating the value of our solutions. We plan to offer an integrated mobile application experience to improve customer experience from purchase, through onboarding and use. We have a global customer services organization, and we leverage frequent communication and feedback from our customers to continually improve our solutions and services.

Increase sales to existing customers.

We believe the strong customer satisfaction we maintain with our customers provides us with the opportunity to engage them in new services offerings. We introduced Norton 360 in April 2019, with various tiers of membership, and we are actively engaging with customers of standalone products to move them into a Norton 360 membership. We also believe a substantial opportunity exists to increase the penetration of our premium-level consumer solutions. Over time, we plan to add additional offerings and services for our customers to drive further growth.

Sales and Marketing

We execute a global, multi-channel direct acquisition and brand marketing program. We sell our products primarily direct-to-consumer through our in-house e-commerce platform, and indirectly through partner relationships with retailers, telecom service providers, hardware OEMs, and employee benefit providers. This program is designed to grow our customer base by increasing brand awareness and understanding of our superior products, as well as maximizing our reach to prospective customers.

Direct-to-consumer.

We use advertising and direct response marketing to elevate our brand, attract new customers, and generate significant demand for our services. This program drives most bookings.



We use a variety of marketing programs to target customers, including digital marketing and online display advertising; paid search and search-engine optimization; radio, television, and print advertisements; direct mail campaigns; press coverage for our company and our services; third-party endorsements; and education programs.

Indirect partner distribution channels

. We use strategic and affiliate partner distribution channels to refer prospective customers to us and expand our reach to our partners’ and affiliates’ customer bases. We have developed and implemented a global partner sales organization that targets new, as well as existing, partners to enhance our partner distribution channels. These channels include: retailers, telecom service providers, hardware OEMs, and employee benefit providers. Physical retail and OEM partners represent a small portion of our distribution, which minimizes the impacts of supply chain disruptions.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving business environment. We believe that the competitive factors in our market include access to a breadth of identity and consumer transaction data, broad and effective service offerings, brand recognition, technology, effective and cost-efficient customer acquisition, having a large customer base and strong retention rate, customer satisfaction, price, convenience of purchase, ease of use, frequency of upgrades and updates, and quality and reliable customer service. Our competitors vary by offering, geography, and channel.

Our principal competitors are set forth below:

•

Device Security.

Our principal competitors in this market are Avast, Kaspersky, McAfee, Microsoft, Sophos, and Trend Micro.

•

Identity Protection.

Our principal competitors in this market are credit bureaus Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, as well as certain credit monitoring and identity theft protection solutions from others such as Allstate, Credit Karma, and McAfee.

•

Online Privacy.

Our principal competitors in this market are Avast, Kape, ExpressVPN, McAfee, NordVPN, and Pango.

•

Home and Family.

Our principal competitors in this market are Avast, Life360, and McAfee.

•

Other Competitors.

In addition to competition from large consumer security companies such as Avast and McAfee, we also face competition from smaller companies that may develop competing products.

We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the strength of our technology, people, product offerings and integration across all the Cyber Safety pillars. However, some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we possess that afford them competitive advantages. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to develop, promote and sell their offerings; deliver competitive offerings at lower prices or for free; and introduce new solutions and respond to market developments and customer requirements more quickly than we can. For more information on the risks associated with our competitors, please see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.

Research and Development

As cyber threats evolve, we are focused on delivering a portfolio that protects each element of our customers’ digital lives. To do this, we embrace innovation and have developed a global research and development strategy across our Cyber Safety platform. Our engineering and product management teams are focused on delivering new versions of existing offerings, as well as developing entirely new offerings to drive the company’s global leadership in Cyber Safety. We have a technology research organization focused on applied research projects, with the goal of rapidly creating new products to address consumer trends and grow the business, including defending consumer digital privacy. Also, NortonLifeLock’s threat response and security technology organization is a global organization made up of leading threat and security researchers supported by advanced systems to innovate security technology and threat intelligence as the consumer ally for Cyber Safety, protecting our customers against known and emerging threats.

NortonLifeLock has a long history of innovation and we plan to invest in research and development to drive our long-term success.

Intellectual Property

We are a leader amongst Cyber Safety solutions for consumers in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 1,000 U.S. and international patents issued with many pending. We protect our intellectual property rights and investments in a variety of ways to safeguard our technologies and our long-term success. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret and other protections that apply to our software products and services. The term of the patents we hold is, on average, twelve years. From time to time, we enter into cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering broad groups of patents; we have an additional portfolio of over 2,500 U.S. and international patents cross-licensed to us as part of our arrangement with Broadcom as a result of the asset sale of our former enterprise security business.

Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available, and the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. In addition, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.

Companies in the technology industry may own a large number of patents, copyrights, and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation, or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of



intellectual property rights. From time to time, we face, and we expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we may face more claims of infringement. For more information on the risks associated with our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.

Third-Party Service Providers

We are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers. For example, we host many of our products using third-party data center facilities, and we do not control the operation of these facilities. In addition, our endpoint security solution has historically relied upon certain threat analytics software engines and other software (Engine-Related Services) that have been developed and provided by engineering teams that have transferred to Broadcom as part of the Broadcom sale. The technology, including source code, at issue is shared, and pursuant to the terms of the Broadcom sale, we retain rights to use, modify, enhance and create derivative works from such technology. Broadcom has committed to provide these Engine-Related Services under a transition services agreement, substantially to the same extent and in substantially the same manner, as has been historically provided. For information on the risks associated with our dependence on such third-party service providers, please see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.

Governmental Regulation

We collect, use, store or disclose an increasingly high volume, variety, and velocity of personal information, including from employees and customers, in connection with the operation of our business, particularly, in relation to our identity and information protection offerings, which rely on large data repositories of personal information and consumer transactions. The personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal, state, local, and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security. For information on the risks associated with complying with privacy and data security laws, please see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.

Seasonality

As is typical for many consumer technology companies, our business is subject to seasonality. Our third and fourth quarters are seasonally higher due to the holidays in our third quarter, and follow-on holiday purchases and the U.S. tax filing season in our fourth quarter.

Corporate Responsibility

Our annual Corporate Responsibility Report can be found via the NortonLifeLock website at https://www.nortonlifelock.com/about/corporate-responsibility. The information contained, or referred to, on our website, including our Corporate Responsibility Report, is not part of this annual report unless expressly noted.

Employees

As of April 3, 2020, we employed more than 3,600 people worldwide. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with employees to be good, and are focused on effective attraction, development, and retention of, and compensation and benefits to, human resource talent, including workforce and management development, diversity and inclusion initiatives, succession planning, and corporate culture and leadership quality, morale and development, which are vital to the success of our innovation-driven growth strategy. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of our Board of Directors oversees workforce and senior management development and our Board of Directors monitors the culture of the company and leadership quality, morale and development.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND INDUSTRY

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected how we are operating our business, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.

The COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices. Federal and state governments have implemented measures to contain the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, work from home, and closure of non-essential businesses. To protect the health and well-being of our employees, partners and third-party service providers, we have implemented a near company-wide work-from-home requirement for most employees until further notice, made substantial modifications to employee travel policies, and cancelled or shifted our conferences and other marketing events to virtual-only for the foreseeable future. While we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance become available, such precautionary measures could negatively affect our customer success efforts, sales and marketing efforts, or create operational or other challenges, such as a reduction in employee productivity because of the work from home requirement, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. Further, if the COVID-19



pandemic has a substantial impact on our employees, partners or third-party service providers’ health, attendance or productivity, our results of operations and overall financial performance may be adversely impacted. Additionally, if employees, partners or third-party services providers return to work during the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of inadvertent transmission of

COVID

-19 through human contact could still occur and result in litigation

.

Beginning in March 2020, the U.S. and global economies have reacted negatively in response to worldwide concerns due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have not yet experienced a material increase in customers cancellations or a material reduction in our retention rate in 2020, we may experience such an increase or reduction in the future, especially in the event of a prolonged economic down turn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A prolonged economic downturn could result adversely affect demand for our offerings, retention rates and harm our business and results of operations, particularly in light of the fact that our

solutions are discretionary purchases and thus may be more susceptible to macroeconomic pressures

, as well impact the value of our common stock, ability to refinance our debt, and our access to capital.

The duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately forecasted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the disease, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners and third-party service providers. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively and if the macroeconomic conditions of the general economy or the industries in which we operate do not improve, or deteriorate further, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.

If we are unable to develop new and enhanced solutions, or if we are unable to continually improve the performance, features, and reliability of our existing solutions, our competitive position may weaken, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.

Our future success depends on our ability to effectively respond to evolving threats to consumers, as well as competitive technological developments and industry changes, by developing or introducing new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis.

We have in the past incurred, and will continue to incur, significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive, and as we focus on organic growth through internal innovation. Following the Broadcom sale (as defined below), our resources for research and development have decreased, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Nevertheless, we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position, which include, for example, decreasing our reliance on third parties for our Engine-Related Services.

If we are unable to anticipate or react to competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets, our competitive position could weaken, and we could experience a decline in our revenues that could adversely affect our business and operating results.

If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected. Additionally, we must continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments. Customers may require features and capabilities that our current solutions do not have. Our failure to develop new solutions and improve our existing solutions to satisfy customer preferences and effectively compete with other market offerings

in a timely and cost-effective manner may harm our ability to retain our customers and to create or increase demand for our solutions, which may adversely impact our operating results.

The development and introduction of new solutions involve a significant commitment of time and resources and are subject to a number of risks and challenges including but not limited to:

•

Lengthy development cycles;

•

Evolving industry and regulatory standards and technological developments by our competitors and customers;

•

Rapidly changing customer preferences;

•

Evolving platforms, operating systems, and hardware products, such as mobile devices, and related product and service interoperability challenges;

•

Entering into new or unproven markets; and

•

Executing new product and service strategies.

If we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new or improved solutions are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.

We operate in a highly competitive environment, and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our solutions that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to decline.

We operate in intensely competitive markets that experience frequent technological developments, changes in industry and regulatory standards, changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product introductions and improvements. If we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges, or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets, our competitive position could weaken, and we could experience a decline in our revenues that could adversely affect our business and operating results. To compete successfully, we must maintain an innovative research and development effort to develop new solutions and enhance our existing solutions, effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors, appropriately respond to competitive strategies, and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed, used, and stored by our customers. If we are unsuccessful in responding to our



competitors or to changing technological and customer demands, our competitive position and our financial results could be adversely affected.

Our competitors include software vendors that offer solutions that directly compete with our offerings. In addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to end-users of our solutions, we compete with them for the opportunity to have our solutions bundled with the offerings of our strategic partners, such as computer hardware original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and internet service providers (ISPs) and Operating Systems. Our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our solutions with those of our competitors or if these partners more actively promote our competitors’ solutions than our own. In addition, software vendors who have bundled our solutions with theirs may choose to bundle their solutions with their own or other vendors’ solutions or may limit our access to standard interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop solutions for their platform. In the future, further product development by these vendors could cause our solutions to become redundant, which could significantly impact our sales and financial results.

We face growing competition from other technology companies, as well as from companies in the identity threat protection space such as credit bureaus. Many of these competitors are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection software that competes at some levels with our offerings. Our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our solutions.

Security protection is also offered by some of our competitors at prices lower than our prices or in some cases, is offered free of charge. Our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive these lower cost or free security products as replacing the need for full featured solutions like ours. The expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our revenues and operating results by causing, among other things, price reductions of our solutions, reduced profitability, and loss of market share.

Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, or other resources than we do and consequently, may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours. Further consolidation within our industry or other changes in the competitive environment could result in larger competitors that compete with us. We also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the market in which we compete.

We may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully.

The intense competition we face, in addition to general and economic business conditions, can put pressure on us to change our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain solutions or provide offerings, we may need to lower prices in order to compete successfully Similarly, if there is pressure by competitors to raise prices, our ability to acquire new customers and retain existing customers may be diminished. Any such changes may reduce revenue and margins and could adversely affect our financial results.

Additionally, our business may be affected by changes in the macroeconomic environment. Our solutions are discretionary purchases, and customers may reduce or eliminate their discretionary spending on our solutions during a difficult macroeconomic environment. Although we have not yet experienced a material increase in customers cancellations or a material reduction in our retention rate in 2020, we may experience such an increase or reduction in the future, especially in the event of a prolonged economic down turn or a worsening of current conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, during an economic downturn, consumers may experience a decline in their credit or disposable income, which may result in less demand for our solutions. As a result, we may have to lower our prices or make other changes to our pricing model to address these dynamics, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.

If we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively, or if our partners choose not to market and sell our solutions to their customers, our operating results could be adversely affected.

A portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels, including, but not limited to, distributors that sell our products to end-users and other resellers, and

OEM partners that incorporate our products into, or bundle our products with, their products.

These channels involve a number of risks, including:

•

Our resellers, distributors and OEMs are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our solutions to their customers;

•

Our reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause and our OEM partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements with us and new terms may be less favorable due to competitive conditions in our markets and other factors;

•

Our resellers, distributors and OEMs may encounter issues or have violations of applicable law or regulatory requirements or otherwise cause damage to our reputation through their actions;

•

Our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute competing solutions and may, from time to time, place greater emphasis on the sale of these solutions due to pricing, promotions, and other terms offered by our competitors;

•

Any consolidation of electronics retailers can increase their negotiating power with respect to software providers such as us and any decline in the number of physical retailers could decrease the channels of distribution for us;

•

The continued consolidation of online sales through a small number of larger channels has been increasing, which could reduce the channels available for online distribution of our solutions; and

•

Sales through our partners are subject to changes in general economic conditions, strategic direction, competitive risks, and other issues that could result in a reduction of sales.



If we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully, these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate, which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position. If our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future because of general economic conditions or for other reasons, these partners may delay paying their obligations to us, and we may have reduced revenues or collections that could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand, which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future and adversely affect our operating results.

Our revenue and operating results depend significantly on our ability to retain our existing customers, and add new customers, and any decline in our retention rates or failure to add new customers will harm our future revenue and operating results.

Our revenue and operating results depend significantly on our ability to retain our existing customers and add new customers. We sell our solutions to our customers on a monthly or annual subscription basis. Customers may cancel their membership with us at any time without penalty. We therefore may be unable to retain our existing customers on the same or on more profitable terms, if at all. In addition, we may not be able to predict or anticipate accurately future trends in customer retention or effectively respond to such trends. Our customer retention rates may decline or fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including the following:

•

our customers’ levels of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our solutions;

•

the quality, breadth, and prices of our solutions;

•

our general reputation and events impacting that reputation;

•

the services and related pricing offered by our competitors;

•

disruption by new services or changes in law or regulations that impact the need for efficacy of our products and services;

•

our customer service and responsiveness to any customer complaints;

•

customer dissatisfaction if they do not receive the full benefit of our services due to their failure to provide all relevant data;

•

customer dissatisfaction with the methods or extent of our remediation services;

•

our guarantee may not meet our customers’ expectations; and

•

changes in our target customers’ spending levels as a result of general economic conditions or other factors.

If we do not retain our existing customers and add new customers, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline, and our operating results and gross margins will be harmed. In addition, our business and operating results may be harmed if we are unable to increase our retention rates.

We also must continually add new customers both to replace customers who cancel or elect not to renew their agreements with us and to grow our business beyond our current customer base. If we are unable to attract new customers in numbers greater than the percentage of customers who cancel or elect not to renew their agreements with us, our customer base will decrease, and our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Our acquisitions and divestitures create special risks and challenges that could adversely affect our financial results.

As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or divest businesses or assets. For example, we recently completed the sale of certain of our enterprise security assets to Broadcom Inc. (the “Broadcom sale”. These activities can involve a number of risks and challenges, including:

•

Complexity, time, and costs associated with managing these transactions, including the integration of acquired and the winding down of divested business operations, workforce, products, IT systems, and technologies;

•

Diversion of management time and attention;

•

Loss or termination of employees, including costs associated with the termination or replacement of those employees;

•

Assumption of liabilities of the acquired and divested business or assets, including pending or future litigation, investigations or claims related to the acquired business or assets;

•

The addition of acquisition-related debt;

•

Increased or unexpected costs and working capital requirements;

•

Dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders;

•

Unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations; and

•

Substantial accounting charges for acquisition-related costs, amortization of intangible assets, and higher levels of stock-based compensation expense.

We have invested and continue to invest and devote significant resources in the integration of businesses we acquire. The success of each acquisition depends in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities, including certain cost savings and operational efficiencies, or synergies and growth prospects from integrating these businesses in an efficient and



effective manner. If integration of our acquired businesses is not successful, we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or suffer other adverse effects. To integrate acquired businesses, we must integrate and manage the personnel and business systems of the acquired operations. Further, we may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions. Moreover, to be successful, large complex acquisitions depend on large-scale product, technology, and sales force integrations that are difficult to complete on a timely basis or at all and may be more susceptible to the special risks and challenges described above.

In addition, we have, and may in the future, divest businesses, product lines, or assets, with the Broadcom sale being a recent example. Such initiatives may require significant separation activities that could result in the diversion of management’s time and attention, loss of employees, substantial separation costs, and accounting charges for asset impairments. Please see “Risks Related to the Broadcom sale,” below, for additional information regarding our divestiture risks.

Any of the foregoing, and other factors, could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability or other financial benefits from our acquired or divested businesses, product lines or assets or to realize other anticipated benefits of divestitures or acquisitions.

RISKS RELATED TO THE BROADCOM SALE

We may not achieve the intended benefits of the Broadcom sale.

We may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the Broadcom sale. The resource constraints that resulted from the completion of the transaction, included the loss of employees, and could have a continuing impact on the execution of our business strategy and our overall operating results. Further, our remaining employees may become concerned about the future of our remaining operations and lose focus or seek other employment.

We are dependent upon Broadcom for certain engineering and threat response services, which are critical to our products and business

.

We could lose our access to these or other data sources, including threat intelligence, which could cause us competitive harm and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Our endpoint security solution has historically relied upon certain threat analytics software engines and other software (the Engine-Related Services) that have been developed and provided by engineering teams that have transferred to Broadcom as part of the Broadcom sale. The technology, including source code, at issue is shared, and pursuant to the terms of the Broadcom sale, we retain rights to use, modify, enhance and create derivative works from such technology. Broadcom has committed to provide these Engine-Related Services under a transition services agreement, substantially to the same extent and in substantially the same manner, as has been historically provided. As a result, we are dependent on Broadcom for services and technology that are critical to our business, and if Broadcom fails to deliver these Engine-Related Services it would result in significant business disruption, and our business and operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain data from alternative or additional sources if our current sources become unavailable, and if we are able to obtain alternative sources, we could be unable to integrate or deploy them in time, which could cause us competitive harm and have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, in connection with the Broadcom sale, we lost many industry-specific engineers and other capabilities, including certain threat intelligence data which were historically provided by our former Enterprise Security business, the lack of which could have a negative impact on our business and products.

Any cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the results we expect, and these actions may adversely affect our business.

In November 2019, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the November 2019 Plan) in connection with the strategic decision to divest our Enterprise Security business. Actions under this plan include the reduction of our workforce by approximately 3,100 employees, as well as asset write-offs, contract terminations, facilities closures, and the sale of underutilized facilities. We estimate that we will incur total costs of

$550 million

in connection with the November 2019 Plan, excluding stock-based compensation expense, of which approximately

$200 million

are expected to consist of cash expenditures for severance and termination benefits and

$110 million

of cash expenditures for contract terminations. Non-cash costs are estimated to be up to

$240 million

related to asset write-offs and other restructuring costs. These actions are expected to be completed by September 2020. This initiative could result in disruptions to our operations. Any cost-cutting measures could also negatively impact our business by delaying the introduction of new products or technologies, interrupting service of additional products, or impacting employee retention. In addition, we cannot assure you that the cost reduction and streamlining initiatives will be as successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or streamlining of our operations. If our operating costs are higher than we expect, if the expected proceeds from the sale of under-utilized assets do not meet expectations, or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses, our results of operations will suffer.

If we are unsuccessful at executing the transition of the Enterprise Security Business assets from the Broadcom sale, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited.

For the last several years, we have experienced transitions in our business with the integration of two major acquisitions, the completion of several smaller acquisitions, and the Broadcom sale, which comprised an operating segment. These transitions have involved significant turnover in executive management and other key personnel and changes in our strategic direction, as well as resulted in the relocation of our headquarters to Tempe, Arizona. Transitions of this type can be disruptive, result in the



loss of focus and employee morale and make the execution of business strategies more difficult. We may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to such transitions and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs. If we do not succeed in these efforts, or if these efforts are more costly or time-consuming than expected, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business.

Changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuance of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments.

In response to changes in industry structure and market conditions and in connection with the Broadcom sale, we may be required to strategically reallocate our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting certain businesses. Any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges, such as inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities, or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. Our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and decisions. Although in certain instances our vendor agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs, our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel, reschedule or adjust with suppliers.

Further, our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions. Additionally, we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain circumstances, and future goodwill impairment evaluations may result in a charge to earnings.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS

If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, lose key personnel, fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully, or fail to manage our employee base effectively, we may be unable to develop new and enhanced solutions, effectively manage or expand our business, or increase our revenues.

Our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management, technical (including cyber security experts), sales, marketing, e-commerce, finance, and other personnel. Our officers and other key personnel are “at will” employees and we generally do not have employment or non-compete agreements with our employees, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them. Competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant, and we may face new and unexpected difficulties in attracting, retaining, and motivating employees in connection with the relocation of our headquarters to Tempe, Arizona. In connection with the Broadcom sale, we experienced employee attrition and related difficulties and these difficulties and loss of certain expertise and capabilities may continue or increase.

In order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace, we must provide competitive pay packages, including cash and equity-based compensation. Additionally, changes in immigration laws could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business, results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer. The volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees. In addition, we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares required for issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, we may issue fewer equity-based incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees, or conversely, if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.

Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. From time to time, key personnel leave our company and the frequency and number of such departures has widely varied and have resulted in significant changes to our executive leadership team. Although we strive to reduce the negative impact of changes in our leadership, the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases, the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives, our internal control over financial reporting, and our results of operations. In addition, hiring, training, and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming and expensive, may cause additional disruptions to our operations, and may be unsuccessful, which could negatively impact future financial results.

Our inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity event could impair our ability to deliver our products and services and harm our business.

We are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers. For example, we host many of our products using third-party data center facilities, and we do not control the operation of these facilities. These facilities are vulnerable to damage, interruption, or performance problems from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, pandemics, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic and similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and other misconduct. The occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, a pandemic, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and similar events could result in a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems, which in turn, could result in lengthy interruptions in the delivery of our products and services, which could negatively impact our sales and operating results.

Furthermore, our business administration, human resources, compliance efforts, and finance services depend on the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication, and other related systems and operations. A disruption or failure of these systems or operations because of a disaster or other business continuity event, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could



cause data to be lost or otherwise delay our ability to complete sales and provide the highest level of service to our customers. In addition, we could have difficulty producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis, and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results, all of which could adversely affect the trading value of our stock. Although we endeavor to ensure there is redundancy in these systems and that they are regularly backed-up, there are no assurances that data recovery in the event of a disaster would be effective or occur in an efficient manner, including the operation of our global civilian cyber intelligence threat network.

If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions.

In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented a near company-wide work-from-home requirement for most employees until further notice. While we have not experienced any material disruptions to date, there can be no assurance that our technological systems or infrastructure is or will be equipped to facilitate effective remote working arrangements and effectively operate in full compliance with all laws and regulations for our employees in the short or long term.

Our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses, adversely affect our operating results, and require increased time and attention of our management.

We derive a portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the U.S., and we have significant operations outside of the U.S., including engineering, sales and customer support. Our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations, including:

•

Potential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than U.S. laws or that may not be adequately enforced;

•

Requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls, including tariffs, trade barriers and labor restrictions, and related laws that reduce the flexibility of our business operations;

•

Potential changes in trade relations arising from policy initiatives or other political factors;

•

Regulations or restrictions on the use, import, or export of encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications;

•

Local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations;

•

Central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the U.S.;

•

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, economic instability, and inflationary conditions could make our solutions more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries;

•

Limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest sufficiently in our international operations;

•

Difficulties in staffing, managing, and operating our international operations;

•

Difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations;

•

Costs and delays associated with developing software and providing support in multiple languages; and

•

Political unrest, war, or terrorism, or regional natural disasters, particularly in areas in which we have facilities.

A significant portion of our transactions outside of the U.S. is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, our revenues and expenses will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates. We have in the past and expect in the future to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates, especially if international sales grow as a percentage of our total sales or our operations outside the U.S. continue to increase and foreign currency rates continue to experience increased volatility due to the COVID-19 pandemics.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR SOLUTIONS

Our solutions, systems, and website and the data on these sources may be subject to intentional disruption that could materially harm to our reputation and future sales.

Despite our precautions and significant ongoing investments to protect against security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks, and other intentional disruptions of our solutions, we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance and availability of our offerings and harm our reputation as a company. Similarly, experienced computer programmers or other sophisticated individuals or entities, including malicious hackers, state-sponsored organizations, and insider threats including actions by employees and third-party service providers, may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our systems and websites and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services, including the operation of the global civilian cyber intelligence threat network. This risk may be increased during the current COVID-19 pandemic as more individuals are work from home and utilize home networks for the transmission of sensitive information. Such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication, and if successful could expose us and the affected parties, to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of our business operations.

While we engage in a number of measures aimed to protect against security breaches and to minimize problems if a data breach were to occur, our information technology systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, compromise,



disruption, and shutdown due to attacks or breaches by hackers or due to other circumstances, such as error or malfeasance by employees or third party service providers or technology malfunction. The occurrence of any of these events, as well as a failure to promptly remedy these events should they occur, could compromise our systems, and the information stored in our systems could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, stolen, or damaged. Any such circumstance could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain customers as well as strategic partners, cause us to suffer negative publicity, and subject us to legal claims and liabilities or regulatory penalties. In addition, unauthorized parties might alter information in our databases, which would adversely affect both the reliability of that information and our ability to market and perform our services. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently, are constantly evolving and generally are difficult to recognize and react to effectively. We may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive or reactive measures. Several recent, highly publicized data security breaches at other companies have heightened consumer awareness of this issue and may embolden individuals or groups to target our systems or those of our strategic partners or enterprise customers.

Our solutions are complex and operate in a wide variety of environments, systems and configurations, which could result in failures of our solutions to function as designed and negatively impact our

brand recognition and reputation

.

Because we offer very complex solutions, errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance problems with our solutions may and have occurred. For example, we may experience disruptions, outages, and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our websites simultaneously, fraud, or security attacks. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. Interruptions in our solutions, including the operati

on of the global civilian cyber intelligence threat network, could impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us. Our operations are d

ependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. We could potentially lose customer data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of solutions to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario.

Further, our business would be harmed if any of the events of this nature caused our customers and potential customers to believe our solutions are unreliable.

Our brand recognition and reputation are critical aspects of our business to retaining existing customers and attracting new customers.

Furthermore, negative publicity, whether or not justified, relating to events or activities attributed to us, our employees, our strategic partners, our affiliates, or others associated with any of these parties, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our solutions and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, any attempts to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands may be costly and time consuming, and such efforts may not ultimately be successful.

We collect, use, disclose, store, or otherwise process personal information, which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractual commitments, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business.

We collect, use, process, store, transmit or disclose (collectively, process) an increasingly large amount of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, credit card information and other critical data from employees and customers, in connection with the operation of our business, particularly in relation to our identity and information protection offerings.

The personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal, state, local, and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, litigation, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.

Additionally, changes to applicable privacy or data security laws could impact how we process personal information and therefore limit the effectiveness of our solutions or our ability to develop new solutions.

For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of €20 million or four percent of worldwide annual revenues.

Data protection legislation is also becoming increasingly common in the U.S. at both the federal and state level. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA), came into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use, and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties, and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. The burdens imposed by the CCPA and other similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial expenditures in order to comply.

Global privacy and data protection legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and evolving, and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

We may be or become subject to data localization laws mandating that data collected in a foreign country be processed and stored only within that country. If any country in which we have customers were to adopt a data localization law, we could be required to expand our data storage facilities there or build new ones in order to comply. The expenditure this would require, as well as costs of compliance generally, could harm our financial condition.



Additionally, third parties with whom we work, such as vendors or developers, may violate applicable laws or our policies and such violations can place personal information of our customers at risk. In addition, o

ur customers may also accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a device that is lost or stolen, creating the perception that our systems are not secure against third-party access.

This could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. In addition, such third parties could be the target of cyberattack and other data breaches which could impact our systems or our customers’ records.

LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS

Matters relating to or arising from our completed Audit Committee Investigation, including regulatory investigations and proceedings, litigation matters, and potential additional expenses, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.

As previously disclosed in our public filings, the Audit Committee completed its internal investigation in September 2018. In connection with the Audit Committee Investigation, we voluntarily self-reported to the SEC. The SEC commenced a formal investigation, and we continue to cooperate with that investigation. The outcome of such an investigation is difficult to predict. If the SEC commences legal action, we could be required to pay significant penalties and become subject to injunctions, a cease and desist order, and other equitable remedies. We can provide no assurances as to the outcome of any governmental investigation.

We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses related to legal and other professional services in connection with the ongoing SEC investigation, which may continue to adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, securities class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against us, our directors, and officers. The outcome of the securities class actions and other litigation and regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions is difficult to predict, and the cost to defend, settle, or otherwise resolve these matters may be significant. Plaintiffs or regulatory agencies or authorities in these matters may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts or seek to impose sanctions, including significant monetary penalties. The monetary and other impact of these litigations, proceedings, or actions may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Further, an unfavorable resolution of litigations, proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows. Any future investigations or additional lawsuits may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Our solutions are highly regulated, which could impede our ability to market and provide our solutions or adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations.

Our solutions are subject to a high degree of regulation, including a wide variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), and comparable state laws that are patterned after the FTC Act. LifeLock has previously entered into consent decrees and similar arrangements with the FTC and the attorney generals of 35 states as well as a settlement with the FTC relating to allegations that certain of LifeLock’s advertising, marketing and security practices constituted deceptive acts or practices in violation of the FTC Act, which impose additional restrictions on our business, including prohibitions against making any misrepresentation of “the means, methods, procedures, effects, effectiveness, coverage, or scope of” our solutions. Any of the laws and regulations that apply to our business are subject to revision or new or changed interpretations, and we cannot predict the impact of such changes on our business.

Additionally, the nature of our

identity and information protection products

subjects us to the broad regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which may exercise authority with respect to our services, or the marketing and servicing of those services, by overseeing our financial institution or credit reporting agency customers and suppliers, or by otherwise exercising its supervisory, regulatory, or enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services.

If we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology, our financial results could be harmed.

Much of our software and underlying technology is proprietary. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws. However, these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. Third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain, use, distribute, and sell our proprietary information without authorization.

Third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents. Our consumer agreements do not require a signature and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the U.S., and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries. The unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products. Any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software, operating system, and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor, or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers. In addition, any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in, could be costly, may distract management from day-to-day operations, and may lead to additional claims against us, which could adversely affect our operating results.



From time to time we are a party to lawsuits and investigations, which typically require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses, and which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

We have initiated and been named as a party to lawsuits, including patent litigation, class actions, and governmental claims, and we may be named in additional litigation. The expense of initiating and defending, and in some cases settling, such litigation may be costly and divert management’s attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could result in significant fines, settlements, monetary damages, or injunctive relief that could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business, results of operations, and cash flows.

Third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products.

From time to time, third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights, including claims regarding patents, copyrights, and trademarks. Because of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that the number of these claims may grow. In addition, former employers of our former, current, or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us confidential or proprietary information of these former employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and distract management from day-to-day operations. If we are not successful in defending such claims, we could be required to stop selling, delay shipments of, or redesign our solutions, pay monetary amounts as damages, enter into royalty or licensing arrangements, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers. We cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to investigate, defend, and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk.

In addition, we license and use software from third parties in our business. These third-party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and may expose us to additional liability. This liability, or our inability to use any of this third-party software, could result in delivery delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

Some of our products contain “open source” software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.

Certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under so-called “open source” licenses, which may include, by way of example, the GNU General Public License, GNU Lesser General Public License, the Mozilla Public License, the BSD License, and the Apache License.

Some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. By the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. We have established processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source, but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products. In addition, many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS

Fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the trading price of our outstanding securities in the past and could affect the trading price of our outstanding securities in the future.

Our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary in the future due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, the trading price of our outstanding securities could be negatively affected. Volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or

pursue acquisitions. Our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance.

Factors associated with our industry, the operation of our business, and the markets for our solutions may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate, including but not limited to:

•

Fluctuations in demand for our solutions;

•

Disruptions in our business operations or target markets caused by, among other things, terrorism or other intentional acts, outbreaks of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or earthquakes, floods, or other natural disasters;

•

Entry of new competition into our markets;

•

Our ability to achieve targeted operating income and margins and revenues;

•

Competitive pricing pressure for one or more of our solutions;



•

Our ability to timely complete the release of new or enhanced versions of our solutions;

•

The amount and timing of commencement and termination of major marketing campaigns;

•

The number, severity, and timing of threat outbreaks (e.g. worms, viruses, malware, ransomware, and other malicious threats) and cyber security incidents (e.g., large scale data breaches);

•

Loss of customers or strategic partners;

•

Changes in the mix or type of solutions and subscriptions sold and changes in consumer retention rates;

•

The rate of adoption of new technologies and new releases of operating systems, and new business processes;

•

Consumer confidence and spending changes, which could be impacted by market changes and general economic conditions, among other reasons;

•

The impact of litigation, regulatory inquiries, or investigations;

•

The impact of acquisitions and divestitures and our ability to achieve expected synergies or attendant cost savings;

•

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

Movements in interest rates;

•

Changes in tax laws, rules, and regulations; and

•

Changes in consumer protection laws and regulations.

Any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our outstanding securities to fluctuate significantly.

Changes to our effective tax rate could increase our income tax expense and reduce (increase) our net income (loss), cash flows and working capital.

Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:

•

Changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws, including impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R.1) (the 2017 Tax Act) arising from future interpretations of the 2017 Tax Act;

•

Changes to other tax laws, regulations, and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, including actions resulting from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's base erosion and profit shifting project, proposed actions by international bodies such as digital services taxation, as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings;

•

Changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;

•

The tax effects of significant infrequently occurring events that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods;

•

Tax assessments, or any related tax interest or penalties, that could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place;

•

Taxes arising in connection with the Broadcom sale;

•

Taxes arising in connection to changes in our workforce, corporate entity structure or operations as they relate to tax incentives and tax rates.

We report our results of operations based on our determination of the aggregate amount of taxes owed in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. From time to time, we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction believes that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority. We are regularly engaged in discussions and sometimes disputes with these tax authorities. If the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR LIQUIDITY AND INDEBTEDNESS

We cannot predict our future capital needs, and we may be unable to obtain financing, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Adverse economic conditions or a change in our business performance may make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations, investing activities (including potential acquisitions or divestitures), or financing activities. Any required financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties, the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our financial or operational flexibility and would also require us to fund additional interest expense. If additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance our solutions through acquisitions in order to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, which could have a material adverse effect on our solutions offerings, revenues, results of operations, and financial condition.



Failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, ability to hedge certain financial risks, borrowing costs, and access to capital markets.

Our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies, and such agencies have in the past and could in the future downgrade our ratings. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position, ability to hedge certain financial risks, and access to capital markets. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could increase the interest we pay on outstanding or future debt.

There are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial condition.

As of  April 3, 2020, we had an aggregate of

$4.3 billion

of outstanding indebtedness that will mature in calendar years 2020 through 2025, including approximately

$1.5 billion

in aggregate principal amount of existing convertible notes,

$2.3 billion

of senior notes and

$0.5 billion

of outstanding term loans under our senior secured credit facility, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future and/or enter into new financing arrangements. In addition, as of April 3, 2020, we had $1.0 billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. Our ability to meet expenses, to remain in compliance with the covenants under our debt instruments, and to pay interest and repay principal for our substantial level of indebtedness depends on, among other things, our operating performance, competitive developments, and financial market conditions, all of which are significantly affected by financial, business, economic, and other factors. We are not able to control many of these factors. Accordingly, our cash flow may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt, including the notes, and meet our other obligations.

Our level of indebtedness could have other important consequences, including the following:

•

We must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on the term loans and revolving credit facility, our existing senior notes, and other indebtedness, which reduces funds available to us for other purposes such as working capital, capital expenditures, other general corporate purposes, and potential acquisitions;

•

We may be unable to refinance our indebtedness or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate purposes;

•

We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates because borrowings under our senior credit facilities bear interest at variable rates;

•

Our leverage may be greater than that of some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in responding to current and changing industry and financial market conditions;

•

We may be more vulnerable to an economic downturn and adverse developments in our business;

•

We may be unable to comply with financial and other covenants in our debt agreements, which could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, may result in acceleration of certain of our debt and would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects and could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation;

•

Changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of our debt and/or our common stock, adversely affect our access to debt markets, and increase the interest we pay on outstanding or future debt; and

•

Conversion of our convertible notes could result in significant dilution of our common stock, which could result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.

In addition, we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, which are generally not guarantors of our debt. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness will be dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, debt repayment, or otherwise. In general, our subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our debt or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make the

required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.

Changes in the method

of

determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates on our current or future indebtedness and may otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Certain of our indebtedness is made at variable interest rates that use the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR (or metrics derived from or related to LIBOR), as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our debt arrangements that extend beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate, which may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness. In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial markets could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.



Our existing credit agreements impose operating and financial restrictions on us.

The existing credit agreements contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:

•

Incur additional debt;

•

Create liens on certain assets to secure debt;

•

Enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions;

•

Pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments; and

•

Consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.

All of these covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, meet or otherwise address our capital needs, pursue business opportunities, react to market conditions, or otherwise restrict activities or business plans. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and, to the extent such indebtedness is secured in the future, proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness.

Five-Year Summary

(1)

We have a 52/53-week fiscal year. Our fiscal 2020 was a 53-week year, whereas fiscal 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016 each consisted of 52 weeks.

(2)

In fiscal 2020, we completed the sale of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of our Enterprise Security business to Broadcom Inc. (the Broadcom sale) and recognized a gain of

$5,434 million

before income taxes, which is presented within income from income from discontinued operations. In connection with the Broadcom sale, we made a distribution to our stockholders through a special dividend of $12 per share of common stock. The aggregate amount of such dividend payments was $7.2 billion. We also recognized gains of $379 million and $250 million before income taxes on our sale of equity interest in DigiCert and divestiture of ID Analytics, respectively. Both gains were recognized within continuing operations.

(3)

In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard on a modified retrospective basis. The results for fiscal 2020 and 2019 are presented under the new revenue recognition accounting standard, while prior years are not adjusted.

(4)

In fiscal 2018, we sold Website Security and Public Key Infrastructure solutions and recognized a gain of $653 million before income taxes associated with the sale (see

Note 3

to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and we recognized an income tax benefit of $659 million as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R.1).

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto included under Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

OVERVIEW

We are a leading provider of Cyber Safety solutions for consumers. During fiscal year 2020, we completed the sale of our Enterprise Security assets to Broadcom Inc. (Broadcom) and the sale of our ID Analytics solutions to LexisNexis Risk Solutions, part of RELX Inc. With the sale of our enterprise assets, we have transformed ourselves into a pure consumer company. Our NortonLifeLock branded solutions help customers protect their devices, online privacy, identity and home networks.

Fiscal Year Highlights

•

In October 2019, we sold our equity interest in DigiCert Parent Inc. for

$380 million

and realized a gain of

$379 million

, on which we paid income taxes of $53 million.

•

On November 4, 2019, we completed the Broadcom sale under which Broadcom purchased certain of our Enterprise Security assets and assumed certain liabilities for a purchase price of $10.7 billion. As a result, we realized a gain of

$5,434 million

on which we paid income taxes of $1.9 billion as of

April 3, 2020

.

The divestiture of our Enterprise Security business allowed us to shift our operational focus to our consumer business and represented a strategic shift in our operations. As a result, the results of our Enterprise Security business are classified as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and thus are excluded from both continuing operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, we now have one reportable segment. Revenues and associated costs of our ID Analytics solutions, which were formerly included in the Enterprise Security segment, were included in our remaining reportable segment.

•

In November 2019, we entered into a credit facility and drew down $500 million of a 5-year term loan to repay an existing term loan of $500 million. The credit facility also provides a revolving a line of credit of $1.0 billion and a delayed 5-year term loan commitment of $750 million through September 15, 2020.

•

In November 2019, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan in connection with the strategic decision to divest our Enterprise Security business. We incurred costs of

$423 million

under this plan in fiscal 2020, primarily related to workforce reduction, contract termination, and asset write-offs and impairment charges.

•

In connection with the Broadcom sale, in January 2020, we made a distribution to our stockholders through a special dividend of $12 per share of common stock. The aggregate amount of such dividend payments was $7.2 billion.

•

In January 2020, we completed the sale of our ID Analytics solutions for $375 million in net cash proceeds, resulting in a gain of

$250 million

.

•

In February 2020, we exchanged $250 million of our 2.5% Convertible Notes and $625 million of our 2.0% Convertible Notes for new convertible notes of the same principal amounts and paid the holders of the new convertible notes a total cash consideration of $546 million in lieu of conversion price adjustments related to our $12 special dividend to the exchanged notes. We adjusted the conversion price of the remaining $250 million of our 2.5% Convertible Notes and the remaining $625 million of our 2.0% Convertible Notes and extended the maturity date by one year.

•

In March 2020, we settled $250 million of our 2.5% Convertible Notes for

$566 million

, which included a cash settlement of the equity conversion feature.

Subsequent event

In May 2020, we settled the principal and conversion rights of $625 million of our 2.0% Convertible Notes for $1.18 billion in cash.

Fiscal calendar and basis of presentation

We have a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to March 31. Fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 in this report refers to fiscal year ended

April 3, 2020

,

March 29, 2019

, and

March 30, 2018

, respectively. Fiscal 2020 was a 53-week year whereas fiscal 2019 and 2018 each consisted of 52 weeks.



Key financial metrics

The following table provides our key financial metrics for fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019:

•

Net revenues increased

$34 million

primarily due to the favorable impact from the additional week in the fiscal 2020.

•

Operating income increased

$197 million

primarily due to lower compensation expense, lower outside service expense, and lower technical support expense that we achieved as a result of our cost reduction programs, partially offset by higher advertising and promotional expense and higher costs recognized in connection with our restructuring plans.

•

Income (loss) from continuing operations increased

$688 million

primarily due to higher operating income and the gains on the sale of the DigiCert equity method investment and our ID Analytics solutions, partially offset by higher income tax expense.

•

Income from discontinued operations increased

$3,168 million

, net of taxes, primarily due to the gain on the Broadcom sale.

•

Net income and net income per share increased primarily due to higher income from both continuing operations and discontinued operations for the reasons discussed above.

•

Net cash used in operating activities was

$861 million

, compared to cash provided by operating activities of

$1,495 million

in fiscal 2019, primarily due to income tax payments related to our gains on the divestitures described above.

•

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased

$220 million

compared to

March 29, 2019

, primarily due to cash proceeds from the divestitures described above, largely offset by payments of quarterly and special dividends, stock repurchases, and net cash used in operating activities.

•

Contract liabilities increased $17 million compared to

March 29, 2019

, reflecting higher billings than recognized net revenues.

COVID-19 UPDATE

The COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices. Federal and state governments have implemented measures to contain the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, work from home, and closure of non-essential businesses. Further, beginning in March 2020, the U.S. and global economies have reacted negatively in response to worldwide concerns due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

To protect the health and well-being of our employees, partners and third-party service providers, we have implemented a near company-wide work-from-home requirement for most employees until further notice, made substantial modifications to employee travel policies, and cancelled or shifted our conferences and other marketing events to virtual-only for the foreseeable future.  While we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance become available, such precautionary measures could negatively affect our customer success efforts, sales and marketing efforts, or create operational or other challenges, such as a reduction in employee productivity because of the work from home requirement, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. Further, if the COVID-19 pandemic has a substantial impact on our employees, partners or third-party service providers’ health, attendance or productivity, our results of operations and overall financial performance may be adversely impacted. Additionally, if employees, partners or third-party services providers return to work during the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of inadvertent transmission of

COVID

-19 through human contact could still occur and result in litigation

.

Although we have not yet experienced a material increase in customers cancellations or a material reduction in our retention rate in 2020, a prolonged economic downturn could result adversely affect demand for our offerings, retention rates and harm our business and results of operations, particularly in light of the fact that our



solutions are discretionary purchases and thus may be more susceptible to macroeconomic pressures

, as well impact the value of our common stock, our ability to refinance our debt, and our access to capital.

The duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately forecasted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the disease, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners and third-party service providers. For more information on the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, please see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP) requires us to make estimates, including judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed, and the resulting amounts are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates. Making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business combinations

We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of purchase price requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed especially with respect to intangible assets.

Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer relationships, developed technology, trade names, and acquired patents; and discount rates. Management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results.

Income taxes

We are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. We are required to estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess the temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities, including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. We apply judgment in the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes which includes the following critical accounting estimates.

We use a two-step process to recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that the tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various outcomes. We re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period.

Loss contingencies

We are subject to contingencies that expose us to losses, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. We review the status of each significant matter quarterly, and we may revise our estimates. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for that reporting period.

Discontinued Operations

We review the presentation of planned business dispositions in the Consolidated Financial Statements based on the available information and events that have occurred. The review consists of evaluating whether the business meets the definition of a



component for which the operations and cash flows are clearly distinguishable from the other components of the business, and if so, whether it is anticipated that after the disposal the cash flows of the component would be eliminated from continuing operations and whether the disposition represents a strategic shift that has a major effect on operations and financial results. In addition, we evaluate whether the business has met the criteria as a business held for sale. In order for a planned disposition to be classified as a business held for sale, the established criteria must be met as of the reporting date, including an active program to market the business and the expected disposition of the business within one year.

Planned business dispositions are presented as discontinued operations when all the criteria described above are met. For those divestitures that qualify as discontinued operations, all comparative periods presented are reclassified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, the results of operations of a discontinued operation are reclassified to income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for all periods presented. Results of discontinued operations include all revenues and expenses directly derived from such businesses; general corporate overhead is not allocated to discontinued operations. See

Note 3

- Divestiture and Discontinued Operations in our Notes to Consolidated Financial statements for additional information.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following table sets forth our Consolidated Statements of Operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated:

Note: The percentages may not add due to rounding.

Net revenues

Fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019

Net revenues increased

$34 million

primarily due to approximately $44 million of revenues from the additional week in fiscal 2020.

Fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018

Net revenues decreased

$103 million

primarily due to a $238 million decrease as a result of the divestiture of our website security (WSS) and public key infrastructure (PKI) solutions and $33 million decrease in revenue from our consumer security solutions, partially offset by a

$161 million

increase in revenues of our identity and information protection solutions.

We regularly monitor a number of metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance. Our metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar metrics used by other companies.

The following table summarizes supplemental key performance metrics for our solutions:

(1) ARPU in fiscal 2020 was normalized to exclude the impact of the extra week on direct revenue, which we estimate to be approximately $41 million of direct customer revenue. Excluding this adjustment, APRU would have been $9.07 in fiscal 2020

(2) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. Estimated net revenue generated from direct customers during fiscal year 2018 used in the calculation of ARPU excluded a reduction in revenue related to contract liability purchase accounting adjustments required by GAAP, as further discussed below.

We define direct customer revenues as revenues from sales of our consumer solutions to direct customers, which we define as those customers who have a direct billing relationship with us. Such customer sources include online acquisition and retention, affiliates, co-marketing, and original equipment manufacturer channels. Direct customers excludes customers of our partners, and our ID Analytics solutions and WSS and PKI solutions, all of which have now been divested. The excluded revenues are summarized in the following table:

Average direct customer count presents the average of the total number of direct customers at the beginning and end of the fiscal year.

ARPU is calculated as estimated direct customer revenues for the period divided by the average direct customer count for the same period, expressed as a monthly figure. Non-GAAP fiscal 2018 estimated direct customer revenues used in the calculation of ARPU is adjusted only to exclude a reduction in revenue of $60 million related to purchase accounting adjustments related to the February 2017 acquisition of LifeLock, Inc. ARPU for fiscal 2018 would have been $7.99 without this adjustment. We believe the adjustment is useful to investors to reflect ARPU trends in our business by improving the comparability of ARPU between periods. Fiscal 2020 and 2019 did not include any adjustments to estimated direct customer revenue as the purchase accounting adjustments were fully amortized prior to fiscal 2019. Non-GAAP estimated direct customer revenues and ARPU have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP estimated direct customer revenues or other GAAP measures. We monitor APRU because it helps us understand the rate at which we are monetizing our consumer customer base.

Annual retention rate is defined as the number of direct customers who have more than a one-year tenure as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal period divided by the total number of direct customers as of the end of the period from one year ago. We monitor annual retention rate to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies to improve renewals of subscriptions.

Net revenues by geographic region

Percentage of revenue by geographic region as presented below is based on the billing location of the customer.

Percentages may not add to 100% due to rounding.



The Americas include U.S., Canada, and Latin America; EMEA includes Europe, Middle East, and Africa; APJ includes Asia Pacific and Japan.

Percentage of revenue by geographic region in fiscal 2020 was similar to fiscal 2019. Americas revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 as a result of the sale of our WSS and PKI solutions which proportionally had more revenues in EMEA and APJ than the remaining solutions and higher revenues from our identity and information protection solutions in U.S. during fiscal 2019.

Cost of revenues

Fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019

Our cost of revenues decreased

$62 million

primarily due to decreases in technical support costs and service costs, partially offset by an increase in royalty charges. In addition, during fiscal 2019, we recorded higher inventory write-offs of $10 million due to our discontinuation of our consumer hardware product line.

Fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018

Our cost of revenues decreased

$8 million

primarily due to a $37 million decrease from the divestiture of our WSS and PKI solutions, partially offset by higher inventory and royalty write-offs due to our discontinuation of our consumer hardware product line in fiscal 2019 and higher fulfillment costs.

Operating expenses

Fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019

Sales and marketing expense decreased

$11 million

primarily due to a $75 million decrease in compensation expense and allocated corporate costs, reflecting our cost reduction initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by a

$64 million

increase in advertising and promotional expense reflecting our higher investments in direct marketing programs.

Research and development expense decreased

$92 million

primarily due to a $77 million decrease in compensation expense and allocated corporate costs, and a $23 million decrease in outside services, reflecting our cost reduction initiatives.

General and administrative expense decreased

$42 million

primarily due to a $34 million decrease in compensation expense other than stock-based compensation and allocated corporate costs, and a

$18 million

decrease in stock-based compensation expense.

Amortization of intangible assets was relatively flat compared to fiscal 2019.

Restructuring, transition and other costs increased

$45 million

primarily due to

$101 million

of contract cancellation charges incurred in fiscal 2020, a

$71 million

increase in severance costs, a

$45 million

increase in asset impairments, and a

$20 million

increase in stock-based compensation. These increases were partially offset by

$185 million

costs related to transition projects incurred in fiscal 2019 that were completed by the end of that period. See

Note 12

to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our restructuring plans.

Fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018

Sales and marketing expense decreased

$129 million

primarily due to a $41 million decrease as a result of the divestiture of our WSS and PKI solutions, a $40 million decrease in advertising and promotional expense, a $23 million decrease in compensation expense other than stock-based compensation, and a

$20 million

decrease in stock-based compensation expense.

Research and development expense decreased

$35 million

primarily due to a

$30 million

decrease in stock-based compensation expense and a $20 million decrease as a result of the divestiture of our WSS and KPI solutions, partially offset by a $15 million increase in outside services.



General and administrative expense decreased

$77 million

primarily due to an

$85 million

decrease in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a $10 million increase in compensation expense other than stock-based compensation.

Amortization of intangible assets decreased

$7 million

primarily due to the intangible assets sold with the divestiture of WSS and PKI solutions.

Restructuring, transition and other costs decreased

$159 million

primarily due to a

$75 million

decrease in severance and other restructuring costs. In addition, fiscal 2018 costs included $88 million of transition related costs related to our fiscal 2018 divestiture of our WSS and PKI solutions compared to $3 million in fiscal 2019.

Non-operating income (expense), net

Fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019

Non-operating income, net of expense, increased

$729 million

primarily due to a $379 million gain on the sale of the DigiCert equity method investment and a $250 million gain on the sale of our ID Analytics solutions in fiscal 2020. In addition, our loss from equity interest that was divested in fiscal 2020 decreased

$70 million

and our interest income increased

$38 million

as a result of higher investments in money market funds purchased with proceeds from the Broadcom sale.

Fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018

Non-operating income, net of expense, decreased

$663 million

primarily due to the absence of the $653 million gain on the divestiture of our WSS and PKI solutions in fiscal 2018. In addition, our loss from our equity interest that was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased

$75 million

. Interest expense decreased

$48 million

as a result of lower outstanding borrowings during fiscal 2019 due to repayments.

Provision for income taxes

We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and international tax jurisdictions. A substantial portion of our international earnings were generated from subsidiaries organized in Ireland and Singapore. Our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions. Any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict.

Fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019

Our effective tax rate increased primarily due to an increase in income taxes from non-deductible goodwill, and an increase in income taxes as a result of the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion.

Fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2


Our effective tax rate increased primarily due to one-time benefits from Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R.1) (the 2017 Tax Act) in fiscal 2018. In addition, increases in tax expense in fiscal 2019 are attributable to the valuation allowance on capital losses for which we cannot yet recognize a tax benefit.



Discontinued operations

Fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019

Income from discontinued operations in fiscal 2020 reflects a

$5,434 million

gain on the Broadcom sale and

$2,122 million

income tax expense primarily related to the gain. In addition, we recognized

$261 million

restructuring, transition and other costs in fiscal 2020, compared to

$20 million

in fiscal 2019.

Fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018

Income from discontinued operations decreased in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher income tax expense as we had higher foreign tax benefit and stock-based compensation windfalls in fiscal 2018.

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND CASH REQUIREMENTS

Liquidity

We have historically relied on cash generated from operations, borrowings under credit facilities, issuances of debt, and proceeds from divestitures for our liquidity needs.

As of

April 3, 2020

, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of

$2.3 billion

, of which

$0.9 billion

was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed with the objective to preserve principal, maintain liquidity, and generate investment returns. The participation exemption system under current U.S. federal tax regulations generally allows us to make distributions of non-U.S. earnings to the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal tax; however, these distributions may be subject to applicable state or non-U.S. taxes. We have recognized deferred income taxes for local country income and withholding taxes that could be incurred on distributions of certain non-U.S. earnings or for outside basis differences in our subsidiaries.

We also have an undrawn revolving credit facility of

$1.0 billion

which expires in November 2024.

Our principal cash requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs and support on-going business activities, including payment of taxes and cash dividends, funding capital expenditures, servicing existing debt, repurchasing our common stock, and investing in business acquisitions.

Our capital allocation strategy is to balance driving stockholder returns, managing financial risk, and preserving our flexibility to pursue strategic options, including acquisitions. Historically, this has included a quarterly cash dividend, the repayment of debt, and the repurchase of our common stock.

Sale of equity method investment

On October 16, 2019, Clearlake Capital Group, L.P., a private investment firm, and TA Associates, an existing investor of DigiCert and a private equity firm, completed an investment in DigiCert. As a result, we received $380 million in cash for our equity investment in DigiCert and made income tax payments of approximately $53 million as a result of the transaction.

Divestiture of Enterprise Security business

On November 4, 2019, we completed the Broadcom sale under which we received cash proceeds of $10.6 billion. In connection with the transaction, we incurred direct costs of approximately

$39 million

. In fiscal 2020, we paid approximately $1.9 billion of U.S. and foreign income taxes and we expect to pay additional income taxes of $85 million in fiscal 2021 as a result of the transaction.

As a result of the divestiture, on January 31, 2020, we made a distribution to our stockholders through a special dividend of $12 per share of common stock in an aggregate amount of $7.2 billion.

Sale of ID Analytics solutions

On January 31, 2020, we completed the sale of our ID Analytics solutions for approximately

$375 million in net cash proceeds.



Debt

In November 2019, we entered into a credit facility and drew down $500 million of a 5-year term loan to repay an existing term loan of $500 million.

In March 2020, we settled the $250 million principal and conversion rights of our 2.5% Convertible Notes for

$566 million

in cash.

In May 2020, we settled the $625 million principal and conversion rights of our 2.0% Convertible Notes for $1.18 billion in cash.

Share Repurchase Program

During fiscal 2020, we executed repurchases of

68 million

shares of our common stock, under our existing share repurchase program for an aggregate amount of

$1.6 billion

. We have $578 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.

Cash flows

The following table summarizes our cash flow activities

in fiscal


,


and


:

Cash from operating activities

Fiscal 2020

Our cash used in fiscal 2020 reflected net income of

$3,887 million

adjusted by items, consisting primarily of gains on divestitures of $

5,684 million

and a gain on the sale of our equity method investment of $

379 million

, amortization and depreciation of

$361 million

, and stock-based compensation of

$312 million

.

Changes in operating assets and liabilities during fiscal 2020 consisted primarily of the following:

Accounts receivable

decreased

$583 million

, primarily due to the collections of receivables related to our Enterprise Security solutions. Such receivables were not included in the assets that were sold in connection with the Broadcom sale.

Contract liabilities

decreased

$121 million

, primarily due to seasonally higher recognized revenue from our Enterprise Security solutions than billings during the period prior to the Broadcom sale.

Accrued compensation and benefits

decreased

$117 million

, primarily due to a decrease in headcount as a result of the Broadcom sale and our restructuring activities.

Income taxes payable

increased

$383 million

primarily due to taxes owed on the Broadcom sale and the sale of our DigiCert equity method investment. During fiscal 2020, we made aggregate tax payments of $2 billion related to these transactions.

Fiscal 2019

Our cash flows for fiscal 2019 reflected net income of $

31 million

, adjusted by non-cash items, primarily consisting of amortization and depreciation of $

615 million

, stock-based compensation of $

352 million

, and loss from equity interest of $

101 million

.

Changes in operating assets and liabilities during fiscal


consisted primarily of the following:

Accounts receivable

decreased

$113 million

, reflecting lower billings and higher collections in the last months of fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2018.

Contract liabilities

increased

$196 million

, reflecting higher billings versus recognized revenue.

Fiscal 2018

Our cash flows for fiscal 2018 reflected net income of $

1.1 billion

, adjusted by non-cash amortization and depreciation of $

640 million

, stock-based compensation expense of $

610 million

, and offset by a deferred tax benefit of $

1.8 billion

, primarily as a result of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act in December 2017, and a gain on divestiture of $

653 million

.

Changes in operating assets and liabilities during fiscal


consisted primarily of the following:

Accounts receivable

increased

$170 million

, reflecting higher billings in the last months of fiscal 2018 and our shift in sales to solutions with ratable revenue recognition related to our Enterprise Security solutions.



Contract liabilities

increased

$491 million

, reflecting our shift in sales to contracts related to our Enterprise Security solutions with longer durations subject to ratable versus point in time revenue recognition. This resulted in less in-period revenue recognized and higher billings towards the end of the fiscal year due to the seasonal sales cycles for those solutions. These factors were primarily offset by a decrease of $319 million related to our fiscal 2018 divestiture of our WSS and PKI solutions.

Income taxes payable

increased

$880 million

, reflecting the one-time transition tax of $896 million under the 2017 Tax Act.

Cash from investing activities

Our cash flows from investing activities in fiscal 2020 consisted primarily of

$10.9 billion

in net proceeds from the Broadcom sale and the divestiture of ID Analytics solutions and

$380 million

from the sale of our equity method investment in DigiCert.

Our investing activities in fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of

$207 million

, payments for acquisitions of

$180 million

, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of short-term investments of

$139 million

.

Our investing activities in fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of

$933 million

in net proceeds from divestiture of our WSS and PKI solutions, partially offset by payment for acquisitions of

$401 million

and net purchases of

$387 million

of short-term investments.

Cash from financing activities

Our financing activities in fiscal 2020 consisted primarily of payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of

$7.5 billion

, repurchases of common stock of

$1.6 billion

, debt repayments of

$868 million

, consisting of

$552 million

in principal and a

$316 million

cash settlement of the equity rights associated with our Senior Convertible notes, and cash consideration of

$546 million

paid in connection with the exchange of convertible debt.

Our financing activities in fiscal 2019 primarily included debt repayments of

$600 million

, repurchases of common stock of

$234 million

, payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of

$217 million

, and tax payments related to vesting equity awards of

$173 million

.

Our financing activities in fiscal 2018 primarily included debt repayments of

$3.2 billion

.

Cash requirements

Debt -

As of

April 3, 2020

, our total outstanding principal amount of indebtedness is summarized as follows. See

Note 10

to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our debt.

In May 2020, we repaid $625 million of our 2.0% Convertible Notes.

In our second quarter of fiscal 2021, we plan to borrow $750 million under the delayed draw term loan, which will mature in November 2024, and use the proceeds to repay in full our 4.2% Senior Notes, which are due in September 2020.

Debt covenant compliance -

The credit agreement we entered into in November 2019 contains

customary representations and warranties, non-financial covenants for financial reporting, affirmative and negative covenants, including a covenant that we maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than

5.25

to

1.0

, or

5.75

to

1.0

if we acquire assets or business in an aggregate amount greater than

$250 million

, and restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, stock repurchases, and dividends (with exceptions permitting our regular quarterly dividend and other specific capital returns).

As of

April 3, 2020

, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.

Dividends -

On

May 14, 2020

, we announced a cash dividend of

$0.125

per share of common stock to be paid in

June 2020

. Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors.

Stock repurchases -

Under our stock repurchase program, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock through accelerated stock repurchase transactions, open market transactions (including through trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act,) and privately-negotiated transactions. As of

April 3, 2020

, the remaining balance of our stock repurchase authorization is

$578 million

and does not have an expiration date. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities.

Restructuring.

Under our restructuring plans approved by our Board of Directors in August and November 2019, we have incurred and expect to incur cash expenditures for severance and termination benefits and contract terminations. The August 2019 Plan was completed in fiscal 2020 with total cash payments of

$50 million

. As of April 3, 2020, we estimate that we will incur total costs of $

550 million

in connection with the November 2019 Plan, excluding stock-based compensation expense, of which up to $

200 million

is expected to consist of cash expenditures for severance and termination benefits and $

110 million

of cash expenditures for contract terminations, and up to

$240 million

is expected to consist of asset write-offs and other restructuring costs. During fiscal 2020, we made

$196 million

in cash payments related to the November 2019 Plan. These



actions are expected to be completed by September 2020. See

Note 12

to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional cash flow information associated with our restructuring activities.

Contractual obligations

The following is a schedule of our significant contractual obligations as of

April 3, 2020

, including those associated with our discontinued operations. The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the following table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.

(1)

In May 2020, we repaid $625 million of our 2.0% Convertible Notes. See

Note 10

and

Note 19

to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our debt.

(2)

Interest payments were calculated based on the contractual terms of the related Senior Notes, Convertible Senior Notes, and credit facility. Interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate in effect as of

April 3, 2020

. See

Note 10

to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Senior Notes, Convertible Senior Notes, and credit facility.

(3)

These amounts are associated with agreements for purchases of goods or services generally including agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The table above also includes agreements to purchase goods or services that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment. The amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely, and we expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials.

(4)

These amounts represent the transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries under the 2017 Tax Act which may be paid through July 2025.

(5)

We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements that expire on various dates through fiscal 2029. The amounts in the table above exclude expected sublease income. See

Note 9

to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on leases.

Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits and other long-term taxes as of

April 3, 2020

, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore,

$695 million

in long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the contractual obligations table. See

Note 13

to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners, subsidiaries, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us.

In connection with the sale of Veritas and the sale of our Enterprise Security business to Broadcom, we assigned several leases to Veritas Technologies LLC or Broadcom and/or their related subsidiaries.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies. We do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest rate risk

Our short-term investments and cash equivalents primarily consist of corporate bonds and certificate of deposits, respectively. A change in interest could have an adverse impact on their market value. As of

April 3, 2020

, the carrying value and fair value of our short-term investments and cash equivalents was

$434 million

. A hypothetical change in the yield curve of 100 basis points would not result in a significant reduction in fair value.

As of

April 3, 2020

, we had

$3.8 billion

in aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate Senior Notes and convertible debt outstanding, with a carrying amount and a fair value of

$3.6 billion

, based on Level 2 inputs. Since these notes bear interest at fixed rates, they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change.



As of

April 3, 2020

, we also had $500 million outstanding debt with variable interest rates based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). A reasonably possible hypothetical adverse change of 100 basis points in LIBOR would not result in a significant increase in interest expense on an annualized basis.

In addition, we have a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility that if drawn bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR and would be subject to the same risks associated with adverse changes in LIBOR.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk

We conduct business in numerous currencies through our worldwide operations, and our entities hold monetary assets or liabilities, earn revenues, or incur costs in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency,

primarily in Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, and Indian Rupee. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services we provide. Our cash flow, results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange gains or losses which impacts our operating results.

We have a foreign exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures, and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations through which we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries with up to twelve months in duration. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of the changes in foreign exchange rates. The gains and losses on these foreign exchange contracts are recorded in interest and other, net in our statement of operations.

As of

April 3, 2020

and

March 29, 2019

, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of

$419 million

and $

1.1 billion

, respectively, to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposure, with an insignificant fair value. A hypothetical ten percent depreciation of foreign currency would result in a reduction in fair value of our forward contracts of $30 million and $84 million for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. This analysis disregards the possibilities that the rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area.

Additional information with respect to our derivative instruments is included in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The SEC defines the term “disclosure controls and procedures” to mean a company’s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. “Disclosure controls and procedures” include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management. Our management (with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act). Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report.



b) Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) for NortonLifeLock. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

April 3, 2020

, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Our management has concluded that, as of

April 3, 2020

, our internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level based on these criteria.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

April 3, 2020

has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended

April 3, 2020

, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

d) Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

NortonLifeLock Inc.:

Opinions on the

Consolidated

Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NortonLifeLock Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of April 3, 2020 and March 29, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April 3, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 3, 2020, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 3, 2020 and March 29, 2019 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April 3, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 3, 2020 based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of March 30, 2019, due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842,

Leases

.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for revenue from contracts with customers as of March 31, 2018, due to the adoption of ASC Topic 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Assessment of uncertain tax positions

As discussed in notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, as of April 3, 2020 the Company recognized uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions when there is more than a 50% likelihood that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. As of April 3, 2020, the Company has recorded a liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits of $724 million.

We identified the assessment of uncertain tax positions as a critical audit matter. Complex auditor judgment, including the involvement of tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, was required to evaluate the Company’s interpretation and application of tax law globally across its multiple subsidiaries.

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s uncertain tax positions process, including controls related to the interpretation of tax law, its application in the liability estimation process, and determination of the final uncertain tax position. We involved tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:

•

Obtaining an understanding of the Company’s overall tax structure across multiple subsidiaries and assessing the Company’s compliance with tax laws globally,

•

Evaluating tax law, and assessing the interpretation under the relevant jurisdictions’ tax law,

•

Inspecting settlements with taxing authorities to assess the Company’s determination of its tax positions and having more than a 50% likelihood to be sustained upon examination, and

•

Performing an assessment of the Company’s tax positions and comparing the results to the Company’s assessment.

In addition, we evaluated the Company’s ability to accurately estimate its gross unrecognized tax benefits by comparing historical gross unrecognized tax benefits to actual outcome upon conclusion of tax examinations.

Evaluation of the exchange of the 2.0% and 2.5% Convertible Notes

As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, in February 2020, the Company exchanged $250 million of its 2.5% Convertible Notes and $625 million of its 2.0% Convertible Notes for new convertible notes of the same principal amounts and paid the holders of the new convertible notes total cash consideration of $546 million in lieu of conversion price adjustments related to a $12 per share cash payment to the exchanged note holders. As a result, the Company recorded $865 million as the liability component, recorded a reduction of additional paid-in capital of $546 million and a $2 million gain on extinguishment.

We identified the evaluation of the exchange of debt for the 2.0% and 2.5% Convertible Notes as a critical audit matter. Complex auditor judgment, was required to evaluate the Company’s accounting treatment and appropriate accounting guidance in relation to the debt extinguishment and the cash payments in connection with the amended Convertible Senior Notes.

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s debt process, including controls over the Company’s evaluation of the accounting guidance, including treatment and assessment of the extinguishment of debt and the cash payments. We read the Company’s amended debt agreements and features included within the agreements and evaluated the accounting guidance. We evaluated management’s accounting treatment and analysis of the debt extinguishment, cash payments, and classification within the consolidated financial statements.

Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies

Business

We are a leading provider of Cyber Safety solutions for consumers. During fiscal year 2020, we completed the sale of our Enterprise Security Assets to Broadcom Inc. (Broadcom) and the sale of our ID Analytics business to LexisNexis® Risk Solutions, part of RELX Inc. With the sale of our enterprise assets, we have transformed ourselves into a pure consumer company and changed our name from Symantec Corporation to NortonLifeLock Inc. Our NortonLifeLock branded solutions help customers protect their devices, online privacy, identity and home networks.

Recent Corporate Name Change

In connection with the sale of certain assets of our Enterprise Security business as disclosed in Discontinued operations below, effective November 4, 2019, we changed our corporate name from Symantec Corporation to NortonLifeLock Inc.

Discontinued operations

On August 8, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement with Broadcom under which Broadcom agreed to purchase certain of our Enterprise Security assets and assume certain liabilities for a purchase price of

$

10.7

billion

(the Broadcom sale). On November 4, 2019, we completed the transaction. The divestiture of our Enterprise Security business allowed us to shift our operational focus to our consumer business and represents a strategic shift in our operations. As a result, the majority of results of our Enterprise Security business were classified as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and thus excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. We have operated in

one

reportable segment since the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The Enterprise Security business was part of our Enterprise Security segment. Results of discontinued operations include all revenues and expenses directly derived from the Enterprise Security business, with the exception of revenues and associated costs of our ID Analytics solutions, which were formerly included in the Enterprise Security segment, and general corporate overhead which were previously allocated to the Enterprise Security segment but are not allocated to discontinued operations. These revenues and expenses are now included in continuing operations. The assets acquired by and liabilities sold to Broadcom, as specified in the August 8, 2019 definitive agreement, are classified as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, subject to changes set forth in the agreement. See

Note 3

for additional information about the divestiture of our Enterprise Security business

.

Principles of consolidation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of NortonLifeLock and our wholly-owned subsidiaries are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal calendar

We have a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to March 31. Our fiscal year


consisted of 53 weeks whereas fiscal years


and


were each 52-week years.

Use of estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based upon historical factors, current circumstances, and the experience and judgment of management. Management evaluates its assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may engage outside subject matter experts to assist in its valuations. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include valuation of business combinations including acquired intangible assets and goodwill, loss contingencies, the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes, including the measurement of uncertain tax positions, and valuation of assets and liabilities and results of operations of our discontinued operations. Actual results could differ from such estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue recognition

On March 31, 2018, the first day of our fiscal 2019, we adopted the new revenue standard, Revenue Recognition - Contracts with Customers, on a modified retrospective basis, applying the practical expedient to all uncompleted contracts as of March 31, 2018. Accordingly, results of our fiscal 2020 and 2019 are presented under the new revenue recognition guidance, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the prior revenue recognition guidance. The adoption of the new revenue standard did not have a significant impact on our net revenues.

We sell products and services directly to end-users and packaged software products through a multi-tiered distribution channel. We recognize revenue when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for such products or services. Performance periods are generally

one year

or less, and payments are generally collected up front. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for partner incentives and rebates, and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.



We offer various channel rebates for our products. Our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and resellers’ performance compared to the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs, which are typically entered into quarterly. Our reserves for rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional program, actual sales during the promotion, the amount of redemptions received, historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program, and the value of the rebate. We record estimated reserves for rebates as an offset to revenue or contract liabilities. Reserves for rebates, recorded in Other current liabilities, were

$


million

and

$


million

as of

April 3, 2020

and

March 29, 2019

, respectively. For products that include content updates, rebates are recognized as a ratable offset to revenue or contract liabilities over the term of the subscription.

Performance obligations

At contract inception, we assess the products and services promised in the contract to identify each performance obligation and evaluate whether the performance obligations are capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. Performance obligations that are not both capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract are combined and treated as a single performance obligation in determining the allocation and recognition of revenue. Our software solutions typically consist of a term-based subscription as well as when-and-if available software updates and upgrades. We have determined that our promises to transfer the software license subscription and the related support and maintenance are not separately identifiable because:

•

the licensed software and the software updates and upgrades are highly interdependent and highly interrelated, working together to deliver continuously updated protection to customers;

•

by identifying and addressing new threats, the software updates and upgrades significantly modify the licensed software and are integral to maintaining its utility; and

•

given the rapid pace with which new threats are identified, the value of the licensed software diminishes rapidly without the software updates and upgrades.

We therefore consider the software license and related support obligations represent a single, combined performance obligation with revenue recognized over time as our solutions are delivered.

Fair value measurements

For assets and liabilities measured at fair value, fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.

The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:

•

Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

•

Level 3: Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.

Assets measured and recorded at fair value

Cash equivalents

. We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at amounts that approximate fair value due to the short period of time to maturity.

Short-term investments

. Short-term investments consist primarily of corporate bonds. They are classified as available-for-sale and recognized at fair value using Level 1 and Level 2 inputs, which are quoted using market prices, independent pricing vendors, or other sources, to determine the fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in

Accumulated other comprehensive loss

(AOCI). We regularly review our investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include: the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been lower than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, credit quality, likelihood of recovery, and our ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.

Derivatives.

We have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts with up to


months in duration to mitigate our foreign currency risk. The forward contracts designated as net investment hedges are used to hedge net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency. Gain or loss on these forward contracts are recognized in the translation adjustments component of AOCI and is reclassified to net earnings in the period in which the hedged subsidiary is either sold or substantially liquidated. We exclude changes in forward points for the forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize these changes in

Other income (expense), net

in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.



The foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedges are used to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposure. These forward contracts are recognized at fair value using Level 2 inputs to determine the fair value.

Non-marketable investments

Our non-marketable investments consist of equity investments in privately-held companies without a readily determinable fair value. We measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Gains and losses on these investments, whether realized or unrealized, are recognized in

Other income (expense), net

in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to fiscal 2019, these investments were accounted for using the cost method of accounting, measured at cost less other-than-temporary impairment.

We accounted for the investment in common stock of DigiCert Parent Inc. (DigiCert) that we received as a portion of the net consideration in the sale of our website security (WSS) and public key infrastructure (PKI) solutions under the equity method. We recorded our interest in the net earnings (loss) of DigiCert based on the most recently available financial statements of DigiCert, which were provided to us on a three-month lag, along with adjustments for amortization of basis differences, in

Other income (expense), net

in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. This investment was sold in October 2019.

We assess the recoverability of our non-marketable investments by reviewing various indicators of impairment. If indicators are present, a fair value measurement is made by performing a discounted cash flow analysis of the investment. We immediately recognize the impairment to our non-marketable equity investments if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. For our equity method investment, if a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, impairment is recognized and included in

Other income (expense), net

in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Accounts receivable

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review our accounts receivables by aging category to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In addition, we maintain an allowance for all other receivables not included in the specific reserve by applying specific percentages of projected uncollectible receivables to the various aging categories. In determining these percentages, we use judgment based on our historical collection experience and current economic trends. We also offset deferred revenue against accounts receivable when channel inventories are in excess of specified levels and for transactions where collection of a receivable is not considered probable.

Assets

Held for Sale

Long-lived assets held for sale are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows, appraised values or management’s estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets and external data available.

Property and equipment

Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives for financial reporting purposes are as follows: buildings,


to


years; building improvements,


to


years; leasehold improvements, the lesser of the life of the improvement or the initial lease term, and computer hardware and software, and office furniture and equipment,


to


years.

Software development costs

The costs for the development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in accordance with the accounting guidance for software. Because our current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility, which occurs upon the completion of a working model,

no

costs have been capitalized for any of the periods presented.

Internal-use software development costs

We capitalize qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage related to software developed for internal-use and amortize them over the estimated useful life of


to


years. We expense costs incurred related to the planning and post-implementation phases of development as incurred.

As of

April 3, 2020

and

March 29, 2019

, capitalized costs, net of amortization, were

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively.

Leases

Beginning March 30, 2019, operating lease assets and liabilities are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. We have elected to not recognize a lease liability or right-of-use (ROU) asset for short-term leases (leases with a term of twelve months or less that do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset). Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The interest rate we use to determine the present value of future payments is our incremental borrowing rate because the rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate for collateralized borrowings in economic environments where the leased asset is located based on credit rating factors. Our operating lease assets also include adjustments for prepaid lease payments

,

lease incentives and initial direct costs

.



Certain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. We elected the practical expedient whereby we record all lease components and the related minimum non-lease components as a single lease component. Cash payments made for variable lease costs are not included in the measurement of our operating lease assets and liabilities. Many of our lease terms include one or more options to renew. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease costs for minimum lease payments for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees.

Business combinations

We use the acquisition method of accounting under the authoritative guidance on business combinations. We allocate the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred. Each acquired company’s operating results are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements starting on the date of acquisition.

Goodwill

Goodwill is recorded when consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired.

We perform an impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level at least annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The accounting guidance gives us the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The qualitative assessment considers events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative test is performed.

In fiscal 2020, based on our qualitative assessments, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair values are more than their carrying values. Accordingly, there was no indication of impairment, and further quantitative testing was not required.

Long-lived assets

In connection with our acquisitions, we generally recognize assets for customer relationships, developed technology, finite-lived trade names, patents, and indefinite-lived trade names. Finite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Such amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally from


to


years. Amortization for developed technology is recognized in cost of revenue. Amortization for customer relationships and certain trade names is recognized in operating expenses. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but instead tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

Long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value.

During the year ended April 3, 2020, we recognized an impairment loss of

$


million

associated with our property and equipment as a result of our restructuring activities. There was

no

impairment associated with our intangible assets.

Contract liabilities

Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and customer deposit liabilities and represent cash payments received or due in advance of fulfilling our performance obligations. Deferred revenue represents billings under non-cancelable contracts before the related product or service is transferred to the customer. Certain arrangements include terms that allow the customer to terminate the contract and receive a pro-rata refund for a period of time. In these arrangements, we have concluded there are no enforceable rights and obligations during the period in which the option to cancel is exercisable by the customer, and therefore the consideration received or due from the customer is recorded as a customer deposit liability.

Debt

Our debt includes senior unsecured notes, senior term loans, convertible senior notes, and a senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Our senior unsecured notes are recorded at par value at issuance less a discount representing the amount by which the face value exceeds the fair value at the date of issuance and an amount which represents issuance costs. Our senior term loans are recorded at par value less debt issuance costs, which are recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the debt. Our convertible senior notes are recorded at par value less the fair value of the equity component of the notes, at their issuance date, determined using Level 2 inputs and less any issuance costs. The discount and issuance costs associated with the various notes are amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the debt as a non-cash charge to interest expense. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility, if any, are recognized at principal balance plus accrued interest based upon stated interest rates. Debt maturities are classified as current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets if we are contractually obligated to repay them in the next twelve months or, prior to the balance sheet date, we have the authorization and intent to repay them prior to their contractual maturities and within the next twelve months.



Treasury stock

We account for treasury stock under the cost method. Shares repurchased under our share repurchase program are retired. Upon retirement, we allocate the value of treasury stock between Paid-in capital and Retained earnings.

Restructuring

Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs, and assets write-offs. Employee-related severance charges are largely based upon substantive severance plans, while some charges result from mandated requirements in certain foreign jurisdictions. These charges are reflected in the period when both the actions are probable, and the amounts are estimable. Contract termination costs reflect costs that will continue to be incurred under a contract for its remaining term without future economic benefit. These charges are reflected in the period when a contract is terminated. Asset impairments, including those related to ROU lease assets, are recognized in the period that an asset is decommissioned or a facility ceases to be used.

Income taxes

We compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in each jurisdiction in which we operate. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled.

We also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and based on this assessment establish a valuation allowance, if required. The determination of our valuation allowance involves assumptions, judgments, and estimates, including forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax expense.

We record accruals for uncertain tax positions when we believe that it is not more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We adjust these accruals when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of adjustments for uncertain tax positions as well as any related interest and penalties.

Stock-based compensation

We measure and recognize stock-based compensation for all stock-based awards, including restricted stock units (RSU), performance-based restricted stock units (PRU), stock options, and rights to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), based on their estimated fair value on the grant date. We recognize the costs in our financial statements on a straight-line basis over the award’s requisite service period except for PRUs with graded vesting, for which we recognize the costs on a graded basis. For awards with performance conditions, the amount of compensation cost we recognize over the requisite service period is based on the actual or estimated achievement of the performance condition. We estimate the number of stock-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover.

The fair value of each RSU and PRU that does not contain a market condition is equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each PRU that contains a market condition is estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair values of RSUs and PRUs are not discounted by the dividend yield because our RSUs and PRUs include dividend-equivalent rights. We use the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of stock options and the fair value of rights to acquire shares of common stock under our ESPP

.

The Black-Scholes valuation model incorporates a number of variables, including our expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the awards, actual and projected employee exercise and forfeiture behaviors, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends.

We have certain liability-classified stock-based compensation awards for which the service inception date precedes the grant date. For these awards, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period. The liability is reclassified to Additional paid-in capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets when the award is granted.

Foreign currency

For foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency, assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Gains and losses resulting from translation of these foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in AOCI. Remeasurement adjustments are recorded in

Other income (expense), net

.

Concentrations of risk

A significant portion of our revenue is derived from international sales. Fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in local regulatory or economic conditions, or piracy could adversely affect our operating results.

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trade accounts receivable. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit risk exposure to any one issuer and to any one country. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to distributors and retailers. The credit risk in our trade accounts receivable is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process, reasonably short collection



terms, and the geographical dispersion of sales transactions.

Customers which are distributors that accounted for over

10%

of our net accounts receivable, are as follows:

Advertising and other promotional costs

Advertising and other promotional costs are charged to operations as incurred and included in sales and marketing expenses.

These costs totaled

$


million

,

$


million

, and

$


million

for fiscal


,


, and


, respectively.

Contingencies

We evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on contingencies. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from potential claims or proceedings, as well as potential ranges of probable losses, when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable. A determination of the amount of an accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates.

Recent Accounting Standards

Recently adopted authoritative guidance

Leases.

In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on lease accounting which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on their balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by operating leases and also requires disclosures designed to give users of financial statements information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. Under the standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.

On March 30, 2019, the first day of our fiscal 2020, we adopted the new guidance using the alternative modified retrospective transition method under which we continue to apply the legacy lease accounting guidance, including its disclosure requirements, in comparative periods prior to fiscal 2020. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard that allowed us not to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases. We currently do not have any finance leases. We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.

The adoption of the new lease accounting standard resulted in the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities of

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, as of March 30, 2019 related to our operating leases. The adoption of the standard also resulted in elimination of deferred rent liabilities of

$


million

, as of March 30, 2019, which are now recorded as a reduction of the ROU assets. The standard did not have an impact on our Consolidated Statements of Operations or Statements of Cash Flows.

Recently issued authoritative guidance not yet adopted

Credit Losses.

In June 2016, the FASB issued new authoritative guidance on credit losses which changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade receivables and other instruments, we will be required to use a new forward-looking “expected loss” model. Additionally, for available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, we will measure credit losses in a manner similar to today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. The standard will be effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2021. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosures.

Internal-Use Software.

In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance that clarifies the accounting for implementation costs in a cloud computing arrangement. The new guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The standard will be effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2021. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income taxes

. In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance that simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions in the current guidance. It also simplifies accounting in areas related to franchise taxes that are partially based on income, transactions that result in a step-up in tax basis of goodwill, separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax, and enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. The standard will be effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2023, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the adoption date and the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.



Although there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable, we do not believe any of these accounting pronouncements has had, or will have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosures.

Debt

The following table summarizes components of our debt:

The term loans bear interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR plus a margin based on the current debt rating of our non-credit-enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt, and our underlying loan agreements. The interest rates for the outstanding term loans are as follows:

As of

April 3, 2020

, the future contractual maturities of debt by fiscal year are as follows:

Senior Term Loan A-5

On August 1, 2016, we entered into a term loan agreement that provides for a


-year term loan (the Senior Term Loan A-5) that bears interest at a floating rate of interest plus an applicable margin, which is based on our senior unsecured credit agency rating. For the duration of Senior Term Loan A-5, quarterly payments are due in aggregate annual amounts equal to


%

of the original principal amount. We may voluntarily repay outstanding principal balances under the Senior Term Loan A-5 at any time without premium or penalty, and prepayments must be applied to reduce the subsequent scheduled and outstanding required payments.

In connection with the credit agreement entered on November 4, 2019 as described below, we fully prepaid the principal amount of

$


million

of our Senior Term Loan A-5. This transaction was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt and resulted in accelerated recognition of interest expense for unamortized debt issuance costs, which was not significant. Out of the repayments,

$


million

was replaced by borrowings under the term loan of

$


million

issued on November 4, 2019 to the same creditors.

Credit facility

On November 4, 2019, we entered into a credit agreement with financial institutions, which provides a revolving line of credit of

$

1,000

million

through November 2024, a


-year term loan of

$


million

, and a delayed


-year term loan commitment of



$


million

through September 15, 2020. At our option, we may increase commitments under the revolving line of credit or the term loan facility by an aggregate amount of up to

$


million

, subject to customary conditions. Interest on borrowings under the credit agreement can be based on a base rate or a LIBOR at our election. Based on our debt ratings and our consolidated leverage ratios as determined in accordance with the credit agreement, loans borrowed bear interest, in the case of base rate loans, at a per annum rate equal to the applicable base rate plus a margin ranging from

0.125

%

to

0.75

%

, and in the case of LIBOR loans, LIBOR, as adjusted for statutory reserves, plus a margin ranging from

1.125

%

to

1.75

%

. The unused revolving line of credit is subject to a commitment fee ranging from

0.125

%

to

0.30

%

per annum. The principal amount of the term loan is repayable in quarterly installments on the last business day of each calendar quarter commencing with the quarter ended March 31, 2021 in an amount equal to

1.25

%

of the aggregate principal amount of the term loan and in the outstanding principal amount upon the November 2024 maturity date. We may voluntarily repay outstanding principal balances without penalty.

The credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties, non-financial covenants for financial reporting, affirmative and negative covenants, including a covenant that we maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than

5.25

to

1.0

, or

5.75

to

1.0

if we acquire assets or business in an aggregate amount greater than

$


million

, and restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, stock repurchases, and dividends (with exceptions permitting our regular quarterly dividend and other specific capital returns). As of

April 3, 2020

, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.

Concurrently with this credit agreement, we terminated our existing revolving line of credit. As of

April 3, 2020

and

March 29, 2019

, there were

no

borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities.

Senior Notes

On February 9, 2017, we issued

$

1.1

%

Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of

5.00

%

per year, payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2017.

We may redeem some or all of the

5.0

Senior Notes at any time prior to April 15, 2020 at a price equal to


%

of the principal amount of the

5.0

Senior Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a premium, as described in the supplemental indenture to the

5.0

%

Senior Notes. On or after April 15, 2020, we may redeem some or all of the

5.0

Senior Notes at the applicable redemption prices set forth in the supplemental indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

In addition, we have

two

series of senior notes, the

4.2

%

Senior Notes and

3.95

%

Senior Notes that are senior unsecured obligations that rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior, unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and may be redeemed at any time, subject to the make-whole provisions contained in the applicable indenture relating to such series of notes. Interest on each series of these notes is payable semi-annually in arrears, on September 15 and March 15 for the

4.2

2.0

%

(

2.0

Convertible Notes (collectively, Convertible Senior Notes) provided for coupon interest payable semiannually in arrears in cash due on October 1 and April 1

of each year in the case of the

2.5

%

Convertible Notes, and February 15 and August 15 in the case of the

2.0

%

Convertible Notes. As of March 29, 2019, the principal amount and associated unamortized discount and issuance costs of the

2.5

%

Convertible Notes were classified as current because upon the 4-year anniversary of the issuance of the notes, holders of thereof had the option to require us to repurchase the notes, in cash, equal to the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest of the

2.5

%

Convertible Notes (the Repurchase Right).

Holders of the Convertible Senior Notes could convert the notes into our common stock at any time up to the maturity date of each note. The conversion rate for the

2.0

%

Convertible Notes was

48.9860

shares of common stock per

$

1,000

principal amount of the notes, which represented an initial conversion price of approximately

$

20.41

per share. The conversion rate for the

2.5

%

Convertible Notes was

59.6341

shares of common stock per

$

1,000

principal amount of the notes, which represented an initial conversion price of approximately

$

16.77

per share. If holders of the Convertible Senior Notes converted them in connection with a fundamental change, such as a sale of substantially all our assets, a change of the control of NortonLifeLock, or a plan for our liquidation or dissolution, we would be required to provide a make-whole premium in the form of an increased conversion rate, subject to a maximum amount, based on the effective date of the fundamental change as set forth in a table contained in the indenture governing each of the Convertible Senior Notes. The conversion rates under the Convertible Senior Notes also included customary anti-dilution adjustments. If the holders requested a conversion, we retained the option to settle the par amount of the Convertible Senior Notes using cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares with the cash settlement not exceeding the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest of the Convertible Senior Notes.

Additionally, we could redeem all or part of the principal of the

2.5

%

Convertible Notes, at our option, at a purchase price equal to the principal amount plus accrued interest on or after the


-year anniversary of the issuance date of the

2.5

%

Convertible Notes (the Redemption Right), if the closing trading price of our common stock exceeds


%

of the then-current conversion price for 20 or more trading days in the 30 consecutive trading-day period preceding our exercise of the redemption right (including the last three such trading days) and provided that we have satisfied all regulatory common stock registration requirements. The

2.0

%

Convertible Notes are not redeemable at our option.

On November 11, 2019, we amended the Convertible Senior Notes agreements to provide that, if and when we pay a special dividend of

$


to our stockholders, we would exchange

$


million

of the principal amount underlying the

2.5

%

Convertible



Notes for new notes to be issued pursuant to a new indenture (the New

2.5

%

Convertible Notes) and would also pay cash consideration of

$


for each share underlying the New

2.5

%

Convertible Notes, and exchange

$


million

of the principal amount underlying the

2.0

%

Convertible Notes for new notes to be issued pursuant to a new indenture (the New

2.0

%

Convertible Notes) and would also pay cash consideration of

$


for each share underlying the New

2.0

%

Convertible Notes, in each case in lieu of conversion price adjustments (the Cash Note Payments). The remaining principal of the Convertible Senior Notes would receive a conversion price adjustment with respect to such special dividend.

The special dividend was payable to stockholders on January 31, 2020. On February 4, 2020, we issued the New

2.5

%

Convertible Notes, which mature on April 1, 2022, and the New

2.0

%

Convertible Notes, which mature on August 15, 2022, pursuant to two new indentures, and made the Cash Note Payments. The Cash Note Payments consisted of

$


million

with respect to holders of the New

2.5

%

Convertible Notes and

$


million

with respect to holders of the New

2.0

%

Convertible Notes. The exchange of the convertible notes was accounted for as extinguishment of debt and the consideration comprising the Cash Note Payments were recorded as charges to paid in capital. We recognized a gain of

$

related to the exchange.

After giving effect to the conversion rate adjustment that was made in connection with the payment of the special dividend on January 31, 2020, the conversion rate for the remaining

$


million

of the

2.5

%

Convertible Notes was

118.9814

shares of common stock per

$

1,000

principal amount of the notes, which represents an adjusted conversion price of approximately

$

8.40

per share and the conversion rate for the remaining

$


million

of the

2.0

%

Convertible Notes was

97.7364

shares of common stock per

$

1,000

principal amount of the notes, which represented an adjusted conversion price of approximately

$

10.23

per share.

In addition, in connection with the amendments, the maturity dates of the

2.5

%

Convertible Notes and the

2.0

%

Convertible Notes were extended to April 1, 2022 and August 15, 2022, respectively. Holders of the Convertible Senior Notes would only be able to convert the notes in a period of six months prior to the extended maturity dates; and the Redemption Right and Repurchase Right were removed.

On March 5, 2020, we entered into an agreement to repay the full

$


million

of principal and conversion rights of the

2.5

%

Convertible Notes for an aggregate amount of

$


million

in cash. The payment was based on

$


per underlying share into which the

2.5

%

Convertible Notes were convertible. In addition, we paid

$


million

of accrued and unpaid interest through the date of settlement, and

$


million

in lieu of a proration of the cash dividend declared on February 6, 2020. The extinguishment was settled on March 10, 2020 and resulted in an adjustment to stockholders’ equity of

$


million

and a loss on extinguishment of

$


million

.

As of April 3, 2020 and March 29, 2019, the Convertible Senior Notes consisted of the following:

(1) In May 2020, we settled

$


million

of our

2.0

%

Convertible Notes for

$

1.18

billion

, which included a cash settlement of the equity conversion feature and payments for accrued and unpaid interests and dividend. See

Note 19

for more information on the settlement.

Based on the closing price of our common stock of

$

18.29

on

April 3, 2020

, the if-converted values of the New

2.5

%

Convertible Notes and the

2.0

%

Convertible Notes exceeded the principal amount by approximately

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively. The if-converted value of the New

2.0

%

Convertible Notes is less than the principal amount.

In addition to the Cash Note Payments discussed above, during fiscal 2020, we made payments totaling

$


million

to holders of the Convertible Notes in lieu of conversion price adjustments because our dividend of

$

0.125

per share to our common stockholders that was paid in December 2019 and March 2020 exceeded the amounts defined in the Convertible Senior Notes agreements.

Derivatives

We conduct business in numerous currencies throughout our worldwide operations, and our entities hold monetary assets or liabilities, earn revenues, or incur costs in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange gains or losses which impacts our operating results. As part of our foreign currency risk mitigation strategy, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts with up to

twelve months

in duration. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of the changes in foreign exchange rates.

To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we conduct a program under which we may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We exclude changes in forward points for the forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We recognize changes in the excluded component in

Other income (expense), net

. As of

April 3, 2020

, there were

no

outstanding notional amounts related to our net investment hedges. As of March 29, 2019, the fair value of these contracts was insignificant. The net gain recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income was insignificant for all periods presented.

We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposure. These forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments. As of

April 3, 2020

and

March 29, 2019

, the fair value of these contracts was insignificant.

The related gain (loss) recognized in

Other income (expense), net

in our Consolidated Statements of Operations was as follows:

The fair value of our foreign exchange forward contracts is presented on a gross basis in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. To mitigate losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties, we have entered into master netting arrangements with our counterparties that allow us to settle payments on a net basis. The effect of netting on our derivative assets and liabilities was not material as of

April 3, 2020

Restructuring, Transition and Other Costs

Our restructuring, transition and other costs consist primarily of severance, contract cancellations, separation, transition, and other related costs. Severance costs generally include severance payments, outplacement services, health insurance coverage, and legal costs. Included in other exit and disposal costs are advisory fees incurred in connection with restructuring events. Separation costs primarily consist of consulting costs incurred in connection with our divestitures. Transition costs are incurred in connection with Board of Directors approved discrete strategic information technology transformation initiatives and primarily consist of consulting charges associated with our enterprise resource planning and supporting systems and costs to automate business processes. Such transition projects were completed by the end of fiscal 2019.

November 2019 Plan

In November 2019, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the November 2019 Plan) in connection with the strategic decision to divest our Enterprise Security business. Actions under this plan include the reduction of our workforce by approximately

3,100

employees, as well as asset write-offs and impairments, contract terminations, facilities closures, and the



sale of underutilized facilities. As of April 3, 2020, we estimate that we will incur total costs of

$


million

, excluding stock-based compensation expense, in connection with the November 2019 Plan, of which up to

$


million

is expected to consist of cash expenditures for severance and termination benefits and

$


million

of cash expenditures for contract terminations. Non-cash costs are estimated to be up to

$


million

related to asset write-offs and other restructuring costs. These actions are expected to be completed by September 2020. As of

April 3, 2020

, we have incurred costs of

$


million

related to our November 2019 Plan, including

$


million

of stock-based compensation.

In addition, in connection with the Broadcom sale, our Board of Directors approved an equity-based severance program under which certain equity awards to certain terminated employees were accelerated. See

Note 15

for more information on the impact of this program.

August 2019 Plan

On August 6, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the August 2019 Plan) to improve productivity and reduce complexity in the way we manage the business. Under the August 2019 Plan, we reduced our global headcount and closed certain facilities. These actions were completed in fiscal 2020. As of

April 3, 2020

, we have incurred costs of

$


million

related to our August 2019 Plan, primarily consisting of severance and termination benefits.

August 2018 Plan

In August 2018, we announced a restructuring plan (the August 2018 Plan) under which we incurred costs of

$


million

as of

April 3, 2020

. These actions were completed in fiscal 2020.

Income Taxes

Pre-tax income from international operations was

$


million

,

$


million

, and

$


million

for fiscal


,


, and


, respectively.

The components of income tax expense (benefit) recorded in continuing operations are as follows:



The U.S. federal statutory income tax rates we have applied for fiscal


,


, and


are as follows:

The difference between our effective income tax and the federal statutory income tax is as follows:

The principal components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:



The valuation allowance provided against our deferred tax assets as of

April 3, 2020

decreased primarily due to a corresponding decrease in capital losses from equity investments and the release of valuation allowance related to certain acquired net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The ending valuation allowance of

$


million

is provided primarily against certain foreign tax credits and unrealized capital losses that are not expected to be realized

.

As of

April 3, 2020

, we have U.S. federal net operating losses attributable to various acquired companies of approximately

$


million

, which, if not used, will expire between fiscal


and


.

$


million

of the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to limitations which currently prevent their use, and therefore these attributes are not expected to be realized. The remaining net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under U.S. federal tax regulations but are expected to be fully realized. Furthermore, we have U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards attributable to various acquired companies of approximately

$


million

. If not used, our U.S. state net operating losses will expire between fiscal


and


. In addition, we have foreign net operating loss carryforwards attributable to various foreign companies of approximately

$


million

, that can be carried forward indefinitely under current applicable foreign tax law. We have

$


million

of foreign tax credits which, if not used, will expire beginning in fiscal


.

In assessing the ability to realize our deferred tax assets, we considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We considered the following: we have historical cumulative book income, as measured by the current and prior two years; we have strong, consistent taxpaying history; we have substantial U.S. federal income tax carryback potential; and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities. We have concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and, thus, that the deferred tax assets as of April 3, 2020 are realizable on a “more likely than not” basis.

The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

There was a change of

$


million

in gross unrecognized tax benefits during the year ended

April 3, 2020

as disclosed above. This gross liability does not include offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, interest deductions, and state income taxes.

Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at

April 3, 2020

,

$


million

, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate.

We recognize interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. At

April 3, 2020

, before any tax benefits, we had

$


million

of accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits. Interest included in our provision for income taxes was an expense of approximately

$


million

for fiscal 2020. If the accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced in the period that such determination is made and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision.

On July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court (Tax Court) issued its opinion in Altera v. Commissioner and concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to stock-based compensation. The Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service appealed the Tax Court decision to the Ninth Circuit. In June 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the July 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court. As a result of this decision, we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of

$


million

in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. On July 22, 2019, the taxpayer requested a rehearing before the full Ninth Circuit, but such request was denied on November 12, 2019. In February 2020, Altera requested a hearing before the Supreme Court of the United States. The final outcome of the case remains uncertain. If the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion is reversed, we would anticipate recording an income tax benefit at that time.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. on a federal basis and in many U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. Our most significant tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Ireland, and Singapore. Our tax filings remain subject to examination by applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time following the tax year to which those filings relate. Our fiscal years 2014 through


remain subject to examination by the IRS for U.S. federal tax purposes. Our fiscal years prior to 2014 have been settled and closed with the IRS. Our 2016 through


fiscal years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes, and our 2016 through


fiscal years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Singapore tax purposes.

The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. Although



potential resolution of uncertain tax positions involves multiple tax periods and jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next


months by

$


million

. Depending on the nature of the settlement or expiration of statutes of limitations, we estimate

$


million

could affect our income tax provision and therefore benefit the resulting effective tax rate.

In April 2020, we became aware of a new interpretation of a country specific withholding tax regulation that could be interpreted to apply to certain of our intra-group transactions. We are evaluating this new information and the effect, if any, on our tax positions. If it is determined that it does impact our previous transaction, this activity would be recorded in the financial statements in fiscal 2021. The amount of the potential impact, if any, on our Consolidated Financial Statements is not yet estimable given, in part, the level of information available at this time.

We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing income tax controversies and the impact, if any, of the expected tolling of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.

Stock-Based Compensation and Other Benefit Plans

Stock incentive plans

The purpose of our stock incentive plans is to attract, retain, and motivate eligible persons whose present and potential contributions are important to our success by offering them

an opportunity to participate in our future performance through equity awards. We have

one

primary stock incentive plan: the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2013 Plan), under which incentive stock options may be granted only to employees (including officers and directors who are also employees), and other awards may be granted to employees, officers, directors, consultants, independent contractors, and advisors. As amended, our stockholders have approved and reserved


million

shares of common stock for issuance under the 2013 Plan. As of

April 3, 2020

,


million



shares remained available for future grant, calculated using the maximum potential shares that could be earned and issued at vesting.

In connection with the acquisitions of various companies, we have assumed the equity awards granted under stock incentive plans of the acquired companies or issued equity awards in replacement thereof. No new awards will be granted under our acquired stock plans.

The following information related to our stock-based awards includes awards associated with our discontinued operations.

RSUs

RSUs generally vest over a

was

$

19.65

,

$


million

, and

$


million

, respectively, which represents the market value of our common stock on the date the PRUs were released.

We have granted PRUs to certain of our executives. Typically, these PRUs have a

three

-year vest period. PRUs granted in fiscal 2019 and 2018 contain a combination of our company’s performance and market conditions whereas our fiscal 2020 PRUs only contain market conditions. The performance conditions are based on the achievement of specified one-year non-GAAP financial metrics. The market conditions are based on the achievement of our relative total shareholder return over a two- and three-year period. Typically,


%

to


%

of target shares are eligible to be earned based on the achievement of the performance and market conditions.



Valuation of PRUs

The fair value of each PRU that does not contain a market condition is equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each PRU that contains a market condition is estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model.

The valuation and the underlying weighted-average assumptions for PRUs are summarized below:

Stock options

(1) As a result of our special dividend of

$


per share paid in January 2020, we reduced the exercise price of


million

options to the extent that their original exercise price equaled or exceeded

$


. The weighted-average exercise prices in the table reflects the exercise price as of the date of the activity and the exercise price of outstanding and exercisable awards as of April 3, 2020 reflect the adjusted exercise prices.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal

, respectively. The fair value of options granted in fiscal 2020 was

$

4.76

per share.

No

options were granted during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.

Restricted stock

In connection with our fiscal 2018 acquisitions, we issued approximately


million

restricted shares of our common stock for which we recognized an aggregate of

$


million

of expense over the service period that ended in fiscal 2020. As of

April 3, 2020

, all of the restricted shares had been released.

Liability-classified awards settled in shares

In each of fiscal 2020 and 2019, we settled certain bonuses by issuing


million

RSUs that vested shortly after the grant date. As of April 3, 2020, and March 29, 2019, the total liability associated with these liability-classified awards was

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, and is presented in Accrued compensation and benefits in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

ESPP

Under our 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, employees may annually contribute up to


%

of their gross compensation, subject to certain limitations, to purchase shares of our common stock at a discounted price. Eligible employees are offered shares through a


-month offering period, which consists of

two

consecutive


-month purchase periods, at


%

of the lower of either the fair market value on the purchase date or the fair market value at the beginning of the offering period.

In August 2018, we cancelled the issuance of common stock under our ESPP for the 6-month purchase period ended August 15, 2018, as a result of the delayed filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2018. All participant contributions were refunded. In addition, the enrollment in the purchase period beginning August 16, 2018 was cancelled. On February 16, 2019, we opened enrollment in a new offering period. As of

April 3, 2020

,


million

shares have been issued under this plan, and


million

shares remained available for future issuance.



The following table summarizes activity related to the purchase rights issued under the ESPP:

The fair value of each stock purchase right under our ESPP is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average grant date fair value related to rights to acquire shares of common stock under our ESPP in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was

$

5.17

per share,

$

6.22

per share, and

$

6.53

per share, respectively.

Dividend equivalent rights

Our RSUs and PRUs contain dividend equivalent rights (DER) that entitles the recipient of an award to receive cash dividend payments when the associated award is released. The amount of DER equals to the cumulated dividends on the issued number of common stock that would have been payable since the date the associated award was granted. As of

April 3, 2020

and

March 29, 2019

, current dividends payable related to DER was

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, recorded as part of Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and long-term dividends payable related to DER was

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, recorded as part of Other long-term liabilities.

Stock-based award modifications

In connection with the Broadcom sale, we approved severance and retention arrangements for certain executives. As a result, these executives are entitled to receive vesting of


%

of their unvested equity, subject to a service condition, and the remaining unvested equity will be earned at levels of


%

to


%

, subject to market and service conditions. In connection with restructuring activities related to the Broadcom sale, we entered into severance and retention arrangements with certain other employees. These arrangements provided for acceleration of either a portion or all of the vesting of their stock-based awards.

During fiscal 2020, we recognized

$


million

of expense associated with these modifications, of which

$


million

was recognized in General and administrative expense,

$


million

in Sales and marketing expense,

$


million

in continuing operations restructuring costs,

$

Other employee benefit plans

401(k) plan

We maintain a salary deferral 401(k) plan for all of our U.S. employees. This plan allows employees to contribute their pretax salary up to the maximum dollar limitation prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. We match the first

3.5

Net Income Per Share

Basic income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share also includes the incremental effect of dilutive potentially issuable common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potentially issuable common shares include the dilutive effect of the shares underlying convertible debt and employee equity awards.

Diluted income (loss) per share was the same as basic income (loss) per share for the year ended March 29, 2019, as there was a loss from continuing operations in the period and inclusion of potentially issuable shares was anti-dilutive.

The components of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share are as follows:

(1) Net income per share amounts may not add due to rounding.

Under the treasury stock method, our convertible debt instruments will generally have a dilutive impact on net income per share when our average stock price for the period exceeds the conversion prices for the convertible debt instruments. Prior to February 4, 2020, the conversion price for the

2.5

%

Convertible Notes and the

2.0

Convertible Notes were

$

16.77

Segment and Geographic Information

Prior to the Broadcom sale, we operated in

two

reportable segments: Enterprise Security and Consumer Cyber Safety. The Enterprise Security segment focused on providing our Integrated Cyber Defense solutions to help business and government customers unify cloud and on-premises security to deliver a more effective cyber defense solution, while driving down cost and complexity. The Consumer Cyber Safety segment focused on providing cyber safety solutions under our NortonLifeLock brand to help consumers protect their devices, online privacy, identities, and home networks. As a result of the divestiture, we now have

one

reportable segment. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis to evaluate company performance and to allocate resources. The change has been reflected in our segment reporting for all periods presented.

Disaggregated net revenues

The following table summarizes net revenues for our major solutions:

Consumer security products include Norton security, Norton Secure VPN, and other consumer security solutions.

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners, subsidiaries, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us.

In addition, our bylaws contain indemnification obligations to our directors, officers, employees, and agents, and we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers to give such directors and officers additional contractual assurances regarding the scope of the indemnification set forth in our bylaws and to provide additional procedural protections. We maintain director and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and officers. It is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such indemnification agreements might not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements, and we have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In connection with the sale of Veritas and the sale of our Enterprise Security business to Broadcom, we assigned several leases to Veritas Technologies LLC or Broadcom and/or their related subsidiaries. As a condition to consenting to the assignments, certain lessors required us to agree to indemnify the lessor under the applicable lease with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of Veritas Technologies LLC, Broadcom, or their related subsidiaries’ breach of payment obligations under the terms of the lease. As with our other indemnification obligations discussed above and in general, it is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. As with our other indemnification obligations, such indemnification agreements might not be subject to maximum loss clauses, and to date, generally under our real estate obligations, we have not incurred material costs as a result of such obligations under our leases and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

We provide limited product warranties, and the majority of our software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party. Historically, payments made under these provisions have been immaterial. We monitor the conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred.

Litigation contingencies

SEC Investigation

As previously disclosed in our public filings, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the Audit Committee) completed its internal investigation (the Audit Committee Investigation) in September 2018. In connection with the Audit Committee Investigation, we voluntarily contacted the SEC in April 2018. The SEC commenced a formal investigation, and we continue to cooperate with that investigation. The outcome of such an investigation is difficult to predict. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses related to legal and other professional services in connection with the SEC investigation. At this stage, we are unable to assess whether any material loss or adverse effect is reasonably possible as a result of the SEC’s investigation or estimate the range of any potential loss.

Securities Class Action and Derivative Litigation

Securities class action lawsuits, which have since been consolidated, were filed in May 2018 against us and certain of our former officers, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The lead plaintiff’s consolidated amended complaint alleged that, during a purported class period of May 11, 2017 to August 2, 2018, defendants made false and misleading statements in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a), and that certain individuals violated Section 20A, of the Securities Exchange Act. Defendants filed motions to dismiss, which the Court granted in an order dated June 14, 2019. Pursuant to that order, plaintiff filed a motion seeking leave to amend and a proposed first amended complaint on July 11, 2019. The Court granted the motion in part on October 2, 2019 and the first amended complaint was filed on October 11, 2019. The Court’s order



dismissed certain claims against certain of our former officers. Defendants filed answers on November 7, 2019. No trial date has been set.

Purported shareholder derivative lawsuits have been filed against us and certain of our former officers and current and former directors in the U.S. District Courts for the District of Delaware and the Northern District of California, Delaware Chancery Court, and Delaware Superior Court, arising generally out of the same facts and circumstances as alleged in the securities class action and alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty and related claims; these lawsuits include an action brought derivatively on behalf of our 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The derivative actions are currently voluntarily stayed in light of the securities class action. No specific amount of damages has been alleged in these lawsuits. We have also received demands from purported stockholders to inspect corporate books and records under Delaware law.

We will continue to incur legal fees in connection with these pending cases and demands, including expenses for the reimbursement of legal fees of present and former officers and directors under indemnification obligations. The expense of continuing to defend such litigation may be significant. We intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any defense. If any of the lawsuits are decided adversely, we may be liable for significant damages directly or under our indemnification obligations, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and cash flows.

At this stage, we are unable to assess whether any material loss or adverse effect is reasonably possible as a result of these lawsuits or estimate the range of any potential loss.

GSA

During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we were advised by the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Civil Division and the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia that the government is investigating our compliance with certain provisions of our U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Multiple Award Schedule Contract No. GS-35F-0240T effective January 24, 2007, including provisions relating to pricing, country of origin, accessibility, and the disclosure of commercial sales practices.

As reported on the GSA’s publicly-available database, our total sales under the GSA Schedule contract were approximately

$


million

from the period beginning January 2007 and ending September 2012. We fully cooperated with the government throughout its investigation, and in January 2014, representatives of the government indicated that their initial analysis of our actual damages exposure from direct government sales under the GSA schedule was approximately

$


million

; since the initial meeting, the government’s analysis of our potential damages exposure relating to direct sales has increased. The government has also indicated they are going to pursue claims for certain sales to California, Florida, and New York as well as sales to the federal government through reseller GSA Schedule contracts, which could significantly increase our potential damages exposure.

In 2012, a sealed civil lawsuit was filed against us related to compliance with the GSA Schedule contract and contracts with California, Florida, and New York. On July 18, 2014, the Court-imposed seal expired, and the government intervened in the lawsuit. On September 16, 2014, the states of California and Florida intervened in the lawsuit, and the state of New York notified the Court that it would not intervene. On October 3, 2014, the DOJ filed an amended complaint, which did not state a specific damages amount. On October 17, 2014, California and Florida combined their claims with those of the DOJ and the relator on behalf of New York in an Omnibus Complaint, and a First Amended Omnibus Complaint was filed on October 8, 2015; the state claims also do not state specific damages amounts. On June 6, 2019, we filed a motion seeking summary judgment on all claims asserted by all plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment on elements of liability on their claims.

On March 30, 2020, the Court issued an Order granting in part and denying in part our motion for summary judgment and granting in part and denying in part the United States’ motion for partial summary judgment.

It is possible that the litigation could lead to claims or findings of violations of the False Claims Act and could be material to our results of operations and cash flows for any period. Resolution of False Claims Act investigations can ultimately result in the payment of somewhere between one and three times the actual damages proven by the government, plus civil penalties in some cases, depending upon a number of factors. Our current estimate of the low end of the range of the probable estimated loss from this matter is

$


million

, which we have accrued. This amount contemplates estimated losses from both the investigation of compliance with the terms of the GSA Schedule contract as well as possible violations of the False Claims Act. There is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred in excess of our accrual for this matter, however, we are currently unable to determine the high end of the range of estimated losses resulting from this matter.

Avila v. LifeLock et al

On

August 29, 2019 the Ninth Circuit issued a mandate remanding a securities class action lawsuit, originally filed on July 22, 2015, against our subsidiary, LifeLock, as well as certain of LifeLock’s former officers (the “LifeLock Defendants”) for further proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. The Ninth Circuit had affirmed in part and reversed in part the August 21, 2017 decision of the District Court, which had dismissed the case with prejudice. The complaint in the remanded action alleges that, during a purported class period of July 30, 2014 to July 21, 2015, a period that predates our acquisition of LifeLock, the LifeLock Defendants made false and misleading statements in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act. We have settled this lawsuit and will pay

$


million

to the class in the settlement. The settlement is subject to approval by the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. As a result of this settlement, we recorded a charge of

$


million

in

General and administrative

in fiscal 2020.



Other

We are involved in a number of other judicial and administrative proceedings that are incidental to our business. Although adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur in one or more of the cases, it is not possible to estimate the possible loss or losses from each of these cases. The final resolution of these lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
